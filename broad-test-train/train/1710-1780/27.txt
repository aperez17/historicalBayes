HOUSE OF COMMONS , NOVEMBER 19 , 1740 .


PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATE , WITH REGARD TO THE BILL FOR PROHIBITING THE EXPORTATION OF CORN , ETC. .


On the first day of the session , his majesty , in his speech from the throne , recommended to parliament to consider of some good law to prevent the growing mischief of the exportation of corn to foreign countries .


On the fourth day , a bill for preventing , for a limited time , the exportation , etc , was read a first time in the house of commons , and the question put , whether it should be printed , which passed in the negative .


This day the agent for the colonies of Pennsylvania and New Jersey , presented a petition against the said corn bill , which was referred to the committee .


Another petition was also presented by the agent for the colony of Connecticut , in New England , setting forth that the chief trade of that colony arose from supplying other British colonies with corn , so that unless that colony be excepted from the restraints intended by this bill , both that and those which are supplied by it will be reduced to great distress , and praying , therefore , that such exception may be allowed .


The allegations in this petition were confirmed by another , from one of the provinces supplied by the colony of Connecticut .


Another petition was presented by the agent for South Carolina , setting forth , that unless the rice produced in that province were allowed to be exported , the colony must be ruined by the irretrievable loss of their whole trade , as the countries now supplied from thence might easily procure rice from the French settlements , already too much their rivals in trade .


This petition was supported by another , offered at the same time by the merchants of Bristol .


A petition was likewise presented by the agent for the sugar islands , in which it was alleged , that if no provisions be imported thither from Britain , they must , in one month , suffer the extremities of famine .


All these petitions were referred to the committee for the bill .


A printed paper was also delivered to the members , entitled , ` considerations on the embargo , ' which enumerated many dangerous consequences likely to be produced by an embargo on provisions , and suggested that it was no better than a wicked scheme for private profit , with other reflections , for which the paper was deemed a libel , and the author committed to prison .


The bill being read in the committee , produced the following memorable debate .


Mr. PULTNEY spoke to this effect : -- Sir , after all the attention which has been bestowed upon the bill now before us , I can not yet conceive it such as can benefit the nation , or such as will not produce far greater inconveniencies than those which it is intended to obviate , and therefore , as those inconveniencies may be prevented by other means , I can not but declare that I am far from approving it .


Our ancestors , sir , have always thought it the great business of this house to watch against the encroachments of the prerogative , and to prevent an increase of the power of the minister  and the commons have always been considered as more faithful to their trust , and more properly the representatives of the people , in proportion as they have considered this great end with more attention , and prosecuted it with more invariable resolution .
If we inquire into the different degrees of reputation , which the several assemblies of commons have obtained , and consider why some are remembered with reverence and gratitude , and others never mentioned but with detestation and contempt , we shall always find that their conduct , with regard to this single point , has produced their renown or their infamy .
Those are always , by the general suffrage of mankind , applauded as the patterns of their country , who have struggled with the influence of the crown , and those condemned as traitors , who have either promoted it by unreasonable grants , or seen it increase by slow degrees , without resistance .


It has not , indeed , sir , been always the practice of ministers to make open demands of larger powers , and avow , without disguise , their designs of extending their authority  such proposals would , in former times , have produced no consequences but that of awakening the vigilance of the senate , of raising suspicions against all their proceedings , and of embarrassing the crown with petitions , addresses , and impeachments .


They were under a necessity , in those times , of promoting their schemes  those schemes which scarcely any ministry has forborne to adopt , by more secret and artful and silent methods , by methods of diverting the attention of the publick to other objects , and of making invisible approaches to the point in view , while they seemed to direct all their endeavours to different purposes .


But such , sir , have been the proofs of implicit confidence , which the administration has received from this assembly , that it is now common to demand unlimited powers , and to expect confidence without restriction , to require an immediate possession of our estates by a vote of credit , or the sole direction of our trade by an act for prohibiting , during their pleasure , the exportation of the produce of our lands .


Upon what instances of uncommon merit , of regard to the pnblick prosperity , unknown in former times , or of discernment superior to that of their most celebrated predecessors , the present ministers found their new claims to submission and to trust , I am , indeed , at a loss to discover  for , however mankind may have determined concerning the integrity of those by whom the late memorable convention was transacted , defended , and confirmed , I know not that their wisdom has yet appeared by any incontestable or manifest evidence , which may set their abilities above question , and fix their reputation for policy out of the reach of censure and inquiries .


The only act , sir , by which it can be discovered that they have any degree of penetration proportionate to their employments , is the embargo lately laid upon provisions in Ireland , by which our enemies have been timely hindered from furnishing themselves , from our dominions , with necessaries for their armies and their navies , and our fellow-subjects have been restrained from exposing themselves to the miseries of famine , by yielding to the temptation of present profit  a temptation generally so powerful as to prevail over any distant interest .


But as nothing is more contrary to my natural disposition , or more unworthy of a member of this house , than flattery , I can not affirm that I ascribe this useful expedient wholly to the sagacity or the caution of the ministry , nor can I attribute all the happy effects produced by it to their benign solicitude for the publick welfare .


I am inclined to believe that this step was advised by those who were prompted to consider its importance by motives more prevalent than that of publick spirit , and that the desire of profit which has so often dictated pernicious measures , has , for once , produced , in return , an expedient just and beneficial  and it has , for once , luckily fallen out , that some of the friends of the administration have discovered that the publick interest was combined with their own .


It is highly probable , sir , that the contractors for supplying the navy with provisions , considering , with that acuteness which a quick sense of loss and gain always produces , how much the price of victuals would be raised by exportation , and , by consequence , how much of the advantage of their contracts would be diminished , suggested to the ministry the necessity of an embargo , and laid before them those arguments which their own observation and wisdom would never have discovered .


Thus , sir , the ministers , in that instance of their conduct , on which their political reputation must be founded , can claim , perhaps , no higher merit , than that of attending to superiour knowledge , of complying with good advice when it was offered , and of not resisting demonstration when it was laid before them .


But as I would never ascribe to one man the merit of another , I should be equally unwilling to detract from due commendations , and shall therefore freely admit , that not to reject good counsel , is a degree of wisdom , at which I could not expect that they by whom the convention was concluded would ever have arrived .


But whatever proficiency they may have made in the art of government since that celebrated period , however they may have increased their maxims of domestick policy , or improved their knowledge of foreign affairs , I can not but confess myself still inclined to some degree of suspicion , nor can prevail upon myself to shut my eyes , and deliver up the publick and myself implicitly to their direction .


Their sagacity , sir , may , perhaps , of late , have received some improvements from longer experience , and with regard to their integrity , I believe , at least , that it is not much diminished  and yet I can not forbear asserting the right of judging for myself , and of determining according to the evidence that shall be brought before me .


I have , hitherto , entertained an opinion that for this purpose only we are deputed by our constituents , who , if they had reposed no confidence in our care or abilities , would have given up , long since , the vexatious right of contesting for the choice of representatives .
They would have furnished the ministry with general powers to act for them , and sat at ease with no other regard to publick measures , than might incite them to animate , with their applauses , the laudable endeavours of their profound , their diligent , and their magnanimous governours .


As I do not , therefore , check any suspicions in my own mind , I shall not easily be restrained from uttering them , because I know not how I shall benefit my country , or assist her counsels by silent meditations .
I can not , sir , but observe that the powers conferred by this bill upon the administration are larger than the nation can safely repose in any body of men , and with which no man who considers to what purposes they may be employed will think it convenient to invest the negotiators of the convention .


Nor do my objections to this act , arise wholly from my apprehensions of their conduct , who are intrusted with the execution of it , but from my reflections on the nature of trade , and the conduct of those nations who are most celebrated for commercial wisdom .


It is well known , sir , how difficult it is to turn trade back into its ancient channel , when it has by any means been diverted from it , and how often a profitable traffick has been lost for ever , by a short interruption , or temporary prohibition .
The resentment of disappointed expectations inclines the buyer to seek another market , and the civility to which his new correspondents are incited by their own interest , detains him , till those by whom he was formerly supplied , having no longer any vent for their products or their wares , employ their labours on other manufactures , or cultivate their lands for other purposes .


Thus , sir , if those nations who have hitherto been supplied with corn from Britain , should find a method of purchasing it from Denmark , or any other of the northern regions , we may hereafter see our grain rotting in our storehouses , and be burdened with provisions which we can neither consume ourselves , nor sell to our neighbours .


The Hollanders , whose knowledge of the importance or skill in the arts of commerce will not be questioned , are so careful to preserve the inlets of gain from obstruction , that they make no scruple of supplying their enemies with their commodities , and have been known to sell at night those bullets which were next day to be discharged against them .


Whether their example , sir , deserves our imitation I am not able to determine , but it ought at least to be considered , whether their conduct was rational or not , and whether they did not , by a present evil , ensure an advantage which overbalanced it .


There are , doubtless , sir , sometimes such exigencies as require to be complied with at the hazard of future profit , but I am not certain that the scarcity which is feared or felt at present , is to be numbered amongst them  but , however formidable it may be thought , there is surely no need of a new law to provide against it : for it is one of those extraordinary incidents , on which the king has the right of exerting extraordinary powers .
On occasions like this the prerogative has heretofore operated very effectually , and I know not that the law has ever restrained it .


It is , therefore , sir , in my opinion , most prudent to determine nothing in so dubious a question , and rather to act as the immediate occasion shall require , than prosecute any certain method of proceeding , or establish any precedent by an act of the senate .


To restrain that commerce by which the necessaries of life are distributed is a very bold experiment , and such as once produced an insurrection in the empire of the Turks , that terminated in the deposition of one of their monarchs .


I therefore willingly confess , sir , that I know not how to conclude : I am unwilling to deprive the nation of bread , or to supply our enemies with strength to be exerted against ourselves  but I am , on the other hand , afraid to restrain commerce , and to trust the authors of the convention .


Mr. PELHAM spoke next , to the following purport : -- Sir , I am always in expectation of improvement and instruction when that gentleman engages in any discussion of national questions , on which he is equally qualified to judge by his great abilities and long experience , by that popularity which enables him to sound the sentiments of men of different interests , and that intelligence which extends his views to distant parts of the world  but , on this occasion , I have found my expectations frustrated , for he has inquired without making any discovery , and harangued without illustrating the question before us .


He has satisfied himself , sir , with declaring his suspicions , without condescending to tell us what designs or what dangers he apprehends .
To fear , without being able to show the object of our terrours , is the last , the most despicable degree of cowardice  and to suspect , without knowing the foundation of our own suspicions , is surely a proof of a state of mind , which would not be applauded on common occasions , and such as no man but a patriot would venture to confess .


He has , indeed , sir , uttered some very ingenious conceits upon the late convention , has alluded to it with great luxuriancy of fancy , and elegance of diction , and must , at least , confess that whatever may be its effects upon the interest of the nation , it has to him been very beneficial , as it has supplied him with a subject of raillery when other topics began to fail him , and given opportunity for the exercise of that wit which began to languish , for want of employment .


What connexion his wonderful sagacity has discovered between the convention and the corn bill , I can not yet fully comprehend , but have too high an opinion of his abilities to imagine that so many insinuations are wholly without any reason to support them .
I doubt not , therefore , sir , but that when some fitter opportunity shall present itself he will clear their resemblance , and branch out the parallel between them into a thousand particulars .


In the mean time , sir , it may be proper for the house to expedite the bill , against which no argument has yet been produced , and which is of too much importance to be delayed by raillery or invectives .


Mr. SANDYS spoke next , in substance as follows : -- Sir , the bill before us , as it is of too great importance to be negligently delayed , is likewise too dangerous to be precipitately hurried into a law .


It has been always the practice of this house to consider money bills with particular attention , because money is power in almost the highest degree , and ought not , therefore , to be given but upon strong assurances that it will be employed for the purposes for which it is demanded , and that those purposes are in themselves just .


But if we consider , sir , the bill now before us , it will appear yet more than a money bill , it will be found a bill for regulating the disposal of that , which it is the great use of money to procure , and is , therefore , not to be passed into a law without a close attention to every circumstance that may be combined with it , and an accurate examination of all the consequences that may be produced by it .


Some of these circumstances or consequences , it is the duty of every member to lay before the house , and I shall , therefore , propose that the inducements to the discovery of any provisions illegally exported , and the manner of levying the forfeiture , may be particularly discussed  for by a defect in this part , the regulation lately established by the regency , however seasonable , produced tumults and distractions , which every good government ought studiously to obviate .


By their proclamation , sir , half the corn that should be found designed for exportation was to be given to those who should discover and seize it .
The populace , alarmed at once with the danger of a famine , and animated by a proclamation that put into their own hands the means of preventing it , and the punishment of those from whose avarice they apprehended it , rose in throngs to execute so grateful a law .
Every man , sir , whose distress had exasperated him , was incited to gratify his resentment  every man , whose idleness prompted him to maintain his family by methods more easy than that of daily labour , was delighted with the prospect of growing rich on a sudden by a lucky seizure .
All the seditious and the profligate combined together in the welcome employment of violence and rapine , and when they had once raised their expectations , there was no small danger lest their impatience of disappointment should determine them to conclude , that corn , wherever found , was designed for exportation , and to seize it as a lawful prize .


Thus , sir , by an imprudent regulation , was every man 's property brought into hazard , and his person exposed to the insults of a hungry , a rapacious , and ungovernable rabble , let loose by a publick proclamation , and encouraged to search houses and carriages by an imaginary law .


That we may not give occasion to violence and injustice of the same kind , let us carefully consider the measures which are proposed , before we determine upon their propriety , and pass no bill on this important occasion without such deliberation as may leave us nothing to change or to repent .


Mr. EARLE spoke next to this effect : -- Sir , notwithstanding the dangers which have been represented as likely to arise from any errour in the prosecution of this great affair , I can not but declare my opinion , that no delay ought to be admitted , and that not even the specious pretence of more exact inquiries , and minute considerations , ought to retard our proceedings for a day .


My imagination , sir , is , perhaps , not so fruitful as that of some other members of this house , and , therefore , they may discover many inconveniencies which I am not able to conceive .
But , as every man ought to act from his own conviction , it is my duty to urge the necessity of passing this bill , till it can be proved to me , that it will produce calamities equally to be dreaded with the consequences of protracting our debates upon it , equal to the miseries of a famine , or the danger of enabling our enemies to store their magazines , to equip their fleets , and victual their garrisons .


If it could be imagined , that there was in this assembly a subject of France or Spain , zealous for the service of his prince , and the prosperity of his country , I should expect that he would summon all his faculties to retard the progress of this bill , that he would employ all his sophistry to show its inconveniency and imperfections , and exhaust his invention to suggest the dangers of haste  and certainly he could do nothing that would more effectually promote the interest of his countrymen , or tend more to enfeeble and depress the power of the British nation .


If this would naturally be the conduct of an enemy , it is unnecessary to prove that we can only be safe by acting in opposition to it , and I think it superfluous to vindicate my ardour for promoting this bill , when it is evident that its delay would be pleasing to the Spaniards .


Mr. BURREL then spoke as follows : -- Sir , if this law be necessary at any time , it can not now be delayed , for a few days spent in deliberation , may make it ineffectual , and that evil may be past of which we sit here contriving the prevention .


That many contracts , sir , for the exportation of provisions are already made in all the maritime parts of the empire , is generally known  and it requires no great sagacity to discover that those by whom they are made , and made with a view of immense profit , are desirous that they may be executed  and that they will soon complete the execution of them , when they are alarmed with the apprehension of a bill , which , in a few days , may take from them the power of exporting what they have already collected , and snatch their gain from them when it is almost in their hands .


A bill for these purposes , sir , ought to fall upon the contractors like a sudden blow , of which they have no warning or dread  against which they , therefore , can not provide any security , and which they can neither elude nor resist .


If we allow them a short time , our expedients will be of little benefit to the nation , which is every day impoverished by the exportation of the necessaries of life , in such quantities , that in a few weeks the law , if it be passed , may be without penalties , for there will be no possibility of disobeying it .


Sir John BARNARD spoke next , to the following purpose : -- Sir , I can not discover the necessity of pressing the bill with such precipitation , as must necessarily exclude many useful considerations , and may produce errours extremely dangerous  for I am not able to conceive what inconveniencies can arise from a short delay .


The exportation of provisions from Ireland is at present stopped by the proclamation  and the beef which was designed for other nations , has been prudently bought up by the contractors , by which those murmurs have been in a great measure obviated which naturally arise from disappointments and losses .


There is , therefore , sir , no danger of exportations from that part of our dominions , which is the chief market for provisions , and from whence our enemies have been generally supplied : in Britain there is less danger of any such pernicious traffick , both because the scarcity here has raised all provisions to a high price , and because merchants do not immediately come to a new market .


The bill , at least , ought not to be passed without regard to the general welfare of our fellow-subjects , nor without an attentive consideration of those petitions which have been presented to us  petitions not produced by panic apprehensions of imaginary dangers , or distant prospects of inconveniencies barely possible , but by the certain foresight of immediate calamities , the total destruction of trade , and the sudden desolation of flourishing provinces .


By prohibiting the exportation of rice , we shall , sir , in one year , reduce the colony of South Carolina below the possibility of subsisting  the chief product of that country , the product which induced us originally to plant it , and with which all its trade is carried on , is rice .
With rice the inhabitants of that province purchase all the other necessaries of life , and among them the manufactures of our own country .
This rice is carried by our merchants to other parts of Europe , and sold again for large profit .


That this trade is very important appears from the number of ships which it employs , and which , without lading , must rot in the harbours , if rice be not excepted from the general prohibition .
Without this exception , sir , it is not easy to say what numbers , whose stations appear very different , and whose employments have no visible relation to each other , will be at once involved in calamity , reduced to sudden distress , and obliged to seek new methods of supporting their families .
The sailor , the merchant , the shipwright , the manufacturer , with all the subordinations of employment that depend upon them , all that supply them with materials , or receive advantage from their labours , almost all the subjects of the British crown , must suffer , at least , in some degree , by the ruin of Carolina .


Nor ought the danger of the sugar islands , and other provinces , less to alarm our apprehensions , excite our compassion , or employ our consideration , since nothing is more evident than that by passing this bill without the exceptions which their petitions propose , we shall reduce one part of our colonies to the want of bread , and confine the other to live on nothing else  for they subsist by the exchange of those products to which the soil of each country is peculiarly adapted : one province affords no corn , and the other supplies its inhabitants with corn only .


The necessity of expediting this bill , however it has been exaggerated , is not so urgent but that we may be allowed time sufficient to consider for what purpose it is to be passed , and to recollect that nothing is designed by it , but to hinder our enemies from being supplied from the British dominions with provisions , by which they might be enabled more powerfully to carry on the war against us .


To this design no objection has been made , but it is well known , that a good end may be defeated by an absurd choice of means , and I am not able to discover how we shall increase our own strength , or diminish that of our enemies , by compelling one part of our fellow-subjects to starve the other .


It is necessary , sir , to prohibit the exportation of corn to the ports of our enemies , and of those nations by which our enemies will be supplied , but surely it is of no use to exclude any part of our own dominions from the privilege of being supplied from another .
Nor can any argument be alleged in defence of such a law , that will not prove with equal force , that corn ought to remain in the same granaries where it is now laid , that all the markets in this kingdom should be suspended , and that no man should be allowed to sell bread to another .


There is , indeed , sir , a possibility that the liberty for which I contend , may be used to wicked purposes , and that some men may be incited by poverty or avarice to carry the enemy those provisions , which they pretend to export to British provinces .
But if we are to refuse every power that may be employed to bad purposes , we must lay all mankind in dungeons , and divest human nature of all its rights  for every man that has the power of action , may sometimes act ill .


It is , however , prudent to obstruct criminal attempts even when we can not hope entirely to defeat them , and , therefore , I am of opinion , that no provisions ought to be exported without some method of security , by which the governours of every place may be assured that they will be conveyed to our own colonies .
Such securities will easily be contrived , and may be regulated in a manner that they shall not be defeated without such hazard , as the profit that can be expected from illegal commerce , will not be able to compensate .


It is , therefore , sir , proper to delay the bill so long , at least , as that we may produce by it the ends intended , and distress our enemies more than ourselves  that we may secure plenty at home , without the destruction of our distant colonies , and without obliging part of our fellow-subjects to desert to the Spaniards for want of bread .


Mr. BOWLES spoke in this manner : -- Sir , the necessity of excepting rice from the general prohibition , is not only sufficiently evinced by the agent of South Carolina , but confirmed beyond controversy or doubt , by the petition of the merchants of Bristol , of which the justice and reasonableness appears at the first view , to every man acquainted with the nature of commerce .


How much the province of South Carolina will be distressed by this prohibition , how suddenly the whole trade of that country will be at a stand , and how immediately the want of many of the necessaries of life will be felt over a very considerable part of the British dominions , has already , sir , been very pathetically represented , and very clearly explained  nor does there need any other argument to persuade us to allow the exportation of rice .


But , from the petition of the merchants of Bristol , it appears that there are other reasons of equal force for this indulgence , and that our regard for the inhabitants of that particular province , however necessary and just , is not the only motive for complying with their request .


It is shown , sir , in this petition , that the prohibition of rice will very little incommode our enemies , or retard their preparations  for they are not accustomed to be supplied with it from our plantations .
We ought , therefore , not to load our fellow-subjects with embarrassments and inconveniencies , which will not in any degree extend to our enemies .


It appears , sir , not only that a very important part of our commerce will be obstructed , but that it will , probably , be lost beyond recovery  for , as only a small quantity of the rice of Carolina is consumed at home , and the rest is carried to other countries , it is easy to conceive that those who shall be disappointed by our merchants will procure so necessary a commodity from other places , as there are many from which it may be easily purchased  and it is well known that trade , if it be once diverted , is not to be recalled , and , therefore , that trade which may be without difficulty transferred , ought never to be interrupted without the most urgent necessity .


To prove , sir , that there is now no such necessity , by a long train of arguments , would be superfluous , for it has been shown already , that our enemies will not suffer by the prohibition , and the miseries that inevitably arise from a state of war , are too numerous and oppressive , to admit of any increase or aggravation upon trivial motives .


The province of Carolina , sir , has already suffered the inconveniencies of this war beyond any other part of his majesty 's dominions , as it is situate upon the borders of the Spanish dominions , and as it is weak by the paucity of the inhabitants in proportion to its extent  let us , therefore , pay a particular regard to this petition , lest we aggravate the terrour which the neighbourhood of a powerful enemy naturally produces , by the severer miseries of poverty and famine .


Sir Robert WALPOLE spoke next , in substance as follows : -- Sir , nothing is more absurd than for those who declare , on all occasions , with great solemnity , their sincere zeal for the service of the publick , to protract the debates of this house by personal invectives , and delay the prosecution of the business of the nation , by trivial objections , repeated after confutation , and , perhaps , after conviction of their invalidity .


I need not observe how much time would be spared , and how much the despatch of affairs would be facilitated by the suppression of this practice , a practice by which truth is levelled with falsehood , and knowledge with ignorance  since , if scurrility and merriment are to determine us , it is not necessary either to be honest or wise to obtain the superiority in any debate , it will only be necessary to rail and to laugh , which one man may generally perform with as much success as another .


The embargo in Ireland was an expedient so necessary and timely , that the reputation of it is thought too great to be allowed to the administration , of whom it has been for many years the hard fate , to hear their actions censured only because they were not the actions of others , and to be represented as traitors to their country for doing always what they thought best themselves , and perhaps sometimes what was in reality approved by those who opposed them .


This , sir , they have borne without much uneasiness , and have contented themselves with the consciousness of doing right , in expectation that truth and integrity must at last prevail , and that the prudence of their conduct and success of their measures would at last evince the justice of their intentions .


They hoped , sir , that there would be some occasions on which their enemies would not deny the expedience of their counsels , and did not expect that after having been so long accused of engrossing exorbitant power , of rejecting advice , and pursuing their own schemes with the most invincible obstinacy , they should be supposed on a sudden to have laid aside their arrogance , to have descended to adopt the opinions , and give themselves up to the direction of others , only because no objection could be made to this instance of their conduct .


How unhappy , sir , must be the state of that man who is only allowed to be a free agent , when he acts wrong , and whose motions , whenever they tend to the proper point , are supposed to be regulated by another !


Whether such capricious censurers expect that any regard should be paid by the publick to their invectives , I am not able to determine , but I am inclined to think so well of their understandings , as to believe that they intend only to amuse themselves , and perplex those whom they profess to oppose .
In one part of their scheme I know not but they may have succeeded , but in the other it is evident how generally they have failed .
It must , at least , sir , be observed of these great patrons of the people , that if they expect to gain them by artifices like this , they have no high opinion of their discernment , however they may sometimes magnify it as the last appeal , and highest tribunal .


With regard , sir , to the manner in which the embargo was laid , and the expedients made use of to enforce the observation of it , they were not the effects of a sudden resolution , but of long and deliberate reflection , assisted by the counsels of the most experienced and judicious persons of both nations  so that if any mistake was committed , it proceeded not from arrogance or carelessness , but a compliance with reasons , that if laid before the house , would , whether just or not , be allowed to be specious .


But , sir , it has not appeared that any improper measures have been pursued , or that any inconveniencies have arisen from them which it was possible to have avoided by a different conduct  for when any expedient fails of producing the end for which it was proposed , or gives occasion to inconveniencies which were neither expected nor designed , it is not immediately to be condemned  for it might fail from such obstacles as nothing could surmount , and the inconveniencies which are complained of might be the consequences of other causes acting at the same time , or cooperating , not by the nature of things , but by the practices of those who prefer their own interest to that of their country .


But though it is , in my opinion , easy to defend the conduct of the ministry , I am far from thinking this a proper time to engage in their vindication .
The important business before us , must now wholly engage us , nor ought we to employ our attention upon the past , but the future .
Whatever has been the ignorance or knowledge , whatever the corruption or integrity of the ministry , this bill is equally useful , equally necessary .
The question is now concerning an act of the senate , not of the ministry , and the bill may proceed without obstructing future examinations .


If the bill , sir , now before us be so far approved as to be conceived of any real benefit to the nation , if it can at all contribute to the distress or disappointment of our enemies , or the prevention of those domestic disturbances which are naturally produced by scarcity and misery , there is no need of arguments to evince the necessity of despatch in passing it .
For if these effects are to be produced by preventing the exportation of provisions , and a law is necessary for that purpose , it is certain that the law must be enacted , while our provisions are yet in our own hands , and before time has been given for the execution of those contracts which are already made .


That contracts , sir , are entered into for quantities that justly claim the care of the legislative power , I have been informed by such intelligence as I can not suspect of deceiving me .
In one small town in the western part of this kingdom , fifty thousand barrels of corn are sold by contract , and will be exported , if time be allowed for collecting and for shipping them .


A few contracts like this will be sufficient to store an army with bread , or to furnish garrisons against the danger of a siege  a few contracts like this will produce a considerable change in the price of provisions , and plunge innumerable families into distress , who might struggle through the present difficulties , which unsuccessful harvests have brought upon the nation , had we not sold the gifts of providence for petty gain , and supported our enemies with those provisions which were barely sufficient for our own consumption .


I have not heard many objections made against the intention of the bill , and those which were offered , were mentioned with such diffidence and uncertainty , as plainly showed , that even in the opinion of him that proposed them , they were of little weight  and I believe they had no greater effect upon those that heard them .
It may , therefore , be reasonably supposed that the propriety of a law to prevent the exportation of victuals is admitted , and surely it can be no question , whether it ought to be pressed forward , or to be delayed till it will be of no effect .


Mr. FAZAKERLY spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , as the bill now under our consideration is entangled with a multitude of circumstances too important to be passed by without consideration , and too numerous to be speedily examined  as its effects , whether salutary or pernicious , must extend to many nations , and be felt in a few weeks to the remotest parts of the dominions of Britain , I can not but think , that they who so much press for expedition on this occasion , consult rather their passions than their reason , that they discover rather enthusiasm than zeal , and that by imagining that they have already traced the effects of a law like this to their utmost extent , they discover rather an immoderate confidence in their own capacity than give any proofs of that anxious caution , and deliberate prudence , which true patriotism generally produces .


There is another method , sir , of proceeding , more proper on this occasion , which has been already pointed out in this debate  a method of exerting the prerogative in a manner allowed by law , and established by immemorial precedents , and which may , therefore , be revived without affording any room for jealousy or complaints .


An embargo imposed only by the prerogative may be relaxed or enforced as occasion may require , or regulated according to the necessity arising from particular circumstances  circumstances in themselves variable , and subject to the influence of a thousand accidents , and which , therefore , can not be always foreseen , or provided against by a law positive and fixed .


Let us not subject the commonwealth to a hazardous and uncertain security , while we have in our hands the means of producing the same end , with less danger and inconveniency  and since we may obviate the exportation of our corn by methods more speedily efficacious than the forms of making laws can allow , let us not oppress our fellow-subjects by hasty or imprudent measures , but make use of temporary expedients , while we deliberate upon the establishment of a more lasting regulation .


Mr. CAMPBELL spoke to the following purpose  -- Sir , that an embargo on merchandise or provisions may , upon sudden emergencies , or important occasions , be imposed by the prerogative , can not be doubted by any man whose studies have made him acquainted with the extent of the regal power , and the manner in which it has been exerted in all ages .
The chief use of the prerogative is to supply the defects of the laws , in cases which do not admit of long consultations , which do not allow time to convoke senates or inquire into the sentiments of the people .


For this reason , in times of war the imperial power is much enlarged , and has still a greater extent as exigencies are more pressing .
If the nation is invaded by a foreign force , the authority of the crown is almost without limits , the whole nation is considered as an army of which the king is general , and which he then governs by martial laws , by occasional judicature , and extemporary decrees .


Such , sir , is the power of the king on particular emergencies , and such power the nature of human affairs must , sometimes , require  for all forms of government are intended for common good , and calculated for the established condition of mankind , but must be suspended when they can only obstruct the purposes for which they were contrived , and must vary with the circumstances to which they were adapted .
To expect that the people shall be consulted in questions on which their happiness depends , supposes there is an opportunity of consulting them without hazarding their lives , their freedom , or their possessions , by the forms of deliberation .


The necessity of extending the prerogative to the extremities of power , is , I hope , at a very great distance from us  but if the danger of the exportation of victuals be so urgent as some gentlemen have represented it , and so formidable as it appears to the whole nation , it is surely requisite that the latent powers of the crown should be called forth for our protection , that plenty be secured within the nation , by barring up our ports , and the people hindered from betraying themselves to their enemies , and squandering those blessings which the fertility of our soil has bestowed upon them .


Sir Robert WALPOLE replied in the following manner : -- Sir , it is so unusual among the gentlemen who have opposed my opinion to recommend an exertion of the regal authority , or willingly to intrust any power to the administration , that , though they have on this occasion expressed their sentiments without any ambiguity of language , or perplexity of ideas , I am in doubt whether I do not mistake their meaning , and can not , without hesitation and uncertainty , propose the motion to which all their arguments seem necessarily to conduct me  arguments of which I do not deny the force , and which I shall not attempt to invalidate by slight objections , when I am convinced , in general , of their reasonableness and truth .


The necessity of that despatch which I have endeavoured to recommend , is not only universally admitted , but affirmed to be so pressing , that it can not wait for the solemnity of debates , or the common forms of passing laws .
The danger which is every moment increasing , requires , in the opinion of these gentlemen , to be obviated by extraordinary measures , and that pernicious commerce , which threatens the distress of the community , is to be restrained by an immediate act of the prerogative .


If this be the opinion of the house , it will be necessary to lay it before his majesty , by a regular address , that the nation may be convinced of the necessity of such extraordinary precautions , and that the embargo may be imposed , at once , with the expedition peculiar to despotick power , and the authority which can be conferred only by senatorial sanctions .


Whether this is the intention of the members , from whose declarations I have deduced it , can only be discovered by themselves , who , if they have any other scheme in view , must explain it in clearer terms , that the house may deliberate upon it , and reject or adopt it , according to its conformity to the laws of our country , and to the present state of our affairs .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke thus : -- Sir , whatever may be the meaning of other gentlemen , who must undoubtedly be left at full liberty to explain their own expressions , I will freely declare , that I am sufficiently understood by the right honourable gentleman , and that , in my opinion , no remedy can be applied to the present distemper of the nation , a distemper by which it is hourly pining away , by which its vitals are impaired , and the necessary nourishment withdrawn from it , that will operate with sufficient efficacy and speed , except an embargo be imposed by the prerogative .


That this opinion , if received by the house , must be the subject of an address , is in itself manifest , and the reason for which an embargo is required , proves that an address ought not to be delayed .


I can not omit this opportunity of remarking , how plainly it must now appear that many of us have been unjustly charged with obstructing the progress of the bill for pernicious purposes , with views of raising discontents in the nation , of exposing the administration to publick hatred , of obstructing the measures of the government , or hindering the success of the war , when we have receded from our general principles , and suspended the influence of our established maxims , for the sake of facilitating an expedient which may promote the general advantage , by recommending his majesty to the affections of his people .


Mr. PELHAM here replied , to this effect : -- Sir , I am far from blaming any gentleman for asserting , on all occasions , the integrity of his designs , or displaying the reasonableness of his conduct  and of what I do not disapprove I shall not decline the imitation .


It is not uncommon , in the heat of opposition , while each man is convinced of his own honesty , and strongly persuaded of the truth of his own positions , to hear each party accused by the other of designs detrimental to the publick interest , of protracting debates by artful delays , of struggling against their own conviction , and of obscuring known truth by objections which discover themselves to be without force .


These accusations , which are on both sides frequent , are , I hope , on both sides generally false  at least , it must appear on this occasion , that those who press the bill had no views of strengthening their party by a victory , of wearying their opponents by obstinacy , or of promoting any private purposes by a new law  since an expedient , by which time may be gained , and the avowed end of hastening this necessary bill secured , is no sooner proposed on one part , than received on the other .


At the close of the debate , a form of an address was proposed by Mr. CLUTTERBUCK  which , being approved by the house , was presented to his majesty : and an embargo was laid on all provisions accordingly .


On the 17th day of sitting the house proceeded on the bill for preventing exportation  and ordered an account of the corn which had been exported for six years last past to be laid before the committee .


The house also addressed his majesty to take off the embargo on ships laden with fish or rice , which his majesty had before ordered to be done .


On the 21st the corn bill was again the subject of deliberation , and some amendments were offered by Mr. SANDYS , containing not only exceptions of rice and fish , which had been before admitted , but likewise of butter , as a perishable commodity , which , if it were not allowed to be exported , would corrupt and become useless in a short time .


He proposed , likewise , that the two islands of Jersey and Guernsey might continue to be supplied , with certain restrictions , from the port of Southampton .


It was proposed , likewise , in favour of some other colonies , that they might receive provisions from Britain , lest there should be a necessity for the inhabitants of those provinces to abandon their settlements .


The penalties of this law , and the manner in which they should be recovered and applied , were likewise settled on this day .


NOVEMBER 25 , 1740 .


The consideration of the corn bill was resumed  and it was particularly debated from what time it should commence , which some of the members were inclined to fix on the 9th day of the session , on which occasion Mr. CAMPBELL spoke as follows :


Sir , that the laws may be observed by the nation without daily violence and perpetual compulsion , that our determinations may be received with reverence , and the regulations which we establish confirmed by the concurrence of our constituents , it is necessary that we endeavour to preserve their esteem , and convince them that the publick prosperity may be safely trusted in our hands .


This confidence is to be gained as well in high stations , as in lower conditions , by large assemblies , as by individuals , only by a constant practice of justice , and frequent exertion of superiour wisdom .
When any man finds his friend oppressive and malicious , he naturally withdraws his affections from him  when he observes him advancing absurd opinions , and adhering to them with obstinacy incapable of conviction , he falls unavoidably into a distrust of his understanding , and no longer pays any deference to his advice , or considers his conduct as worthy of imitation .


In the same manner , sir , if the legislative powers shall , in making laws , discover that they regard any motives before the advantage of their country , or that they pursue the publick good by measures inadequate and ill-concerted , what can be expected from the people , but that they should set up their own judgment in opposition to that of their governours , make themselves the arbiters in all doubtful questions , and obey or disregard the laws at discretion ?


If this danger may arise from laws injudiciously drawn up , it may surely be apprehended from a compliance with this proposal  a proposal that the operation of the law should commence eleven days before the law itself is in being .


I have , hitherto , sir , regarded it as a principle equally true in politicks as in philosophy , that nothing can act when it does not exist  and I did not suspect that a position so evident would ever stand in need of a proof or illustration .


We live , indeed , in an age of paradoxes , and have heard several notions seriously defended , of which some would , not many years ago , have condemned their abetter to a prison or a madhouse , and would have been heard by the wisest of our ancestors with laughter or detestation  but I did not expect that the most hardy innovator would have shocked my understanding with a position like this , or have asserted that a law may operate before it is made , or before it is projected .


That where there is no law there is no transgression , is a maxim not only established by universal consent , but in itself evident and undeniable  and it is , sir , surely no less certain , that where there is no transgression there can be no punishment .


If a man may be punished , sir , by a law made after the fact , how can any man conclude himself secure from the jail or the gibbet ?
A man may easily find means of being certain that he has offended no law in being , but that will afford no great satisfaction to a mind naturally timorous  since a law hereafter to be made , may , if this motion be supposed reasonable , take cognizance of his actions , and how he can know whether he has been equally scrupulous to observe the future statutes of future senates , he will find it very difficult to determine .


Mr. PELHAM rose , and spoke thus : -- Sir , notwithstanding the absurdity which the honourable gentleman imagines himself to have discovered in this proposal , and which he must be confessed to have placed in a very strong light , I am of opinion , that it may , with very little consideration , be reconciled to reason and to justice , and that the wit and satire that have been so liberally employed , will appear to have been lost in the air , without use and without injury .


The operation of the law may , very properly , commence from the day on which the embargo was laid by his majesty 's proclamation , which surely was not issued to no purpose , and which ought not to be disobeyed without punishment .


Sir John BARNARD spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , I can not but be somewhat surprised , that a gentleman so long conversant in national affairs , should not yet have heard or known the difference between a proclamation and a penal law .


By a proclamation , his majesty may prevent , in some cases , what he can not punish  he may hinder the exportation of our corn by ordering ships to be stationed at the entrance of our harbours  but if any should escape with prohibited cargoes , he can inflict no penalties upon them at their return .


To enforce this prohibition by the sanction of punishments is the intention of the present bill , but a proclamation can make nothing criminal , and it is unjust and absurd to punish an action which was legal when it was done .


The law ought , sir , in my opinion , not to commence till time is allowed for dispersing it to the utmost limits of this island  for as it is unreasonable to punish without law , it is not more equitable to punish by a law , of which , they who have unhappily broken it , could have no intelligence .


A future day was agreed to .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , DEC. 2 , 1740 .


DEBATE RELATING TO A SEDITIOUS PAPER OF THE SAME KIND WITH THE CONSIDERATIONS ON THE EMBARGO ON PROVISIONS .


Lord THOMSON took notice of a paper which he had in his hand , and said he received it at the door , where it was given to the members as they came in , and , complaining of it as an indignity offered to the house , desired that it might be read .
Which being done , he rose up , and spoke in substance as follows :


Sir , the crime of exasperating the people against their governours , of raising discontent , and exciting murmurs in a time of general danger , and of attempting to represent wise and salutary measures , which have received the approbation of the whole legislature , as mean artifices , contrived only to raise the fortunes of some favourites of the minister , and aggrandize the officers of state , by the miseries of the people , is a crime too enormous to require or admit any aggravation from rhetorick , and too dangerous to hope for any excuse from candour and lenity .


To read or hear this paper is sufficient for a full conviction of its pernicious tendency , and of the malice of its author  a charge not fixed upon particular expressions capable of a doubtful meaning , and which heat or inadvertency might casually have produced , but supported by the general design of the whole paper , and the continued tenour of the argument , which is evidently intended to show , that an act of government , which can not but appear necessary and seasonable in the present state of our affairs , an act ratified by the concurrence of all the powers of the legislature , is nothing but a scheme of avarice to grow rich by oppression .


Nor is this scandalous libel written with more confidence and insolence than it is dispersed .
Not content , sir , with vilifying the proceedings of the state , the author has industriously published his calumny at our door : the time has been when defamation skulked in secret , and calumnies against the government were dispersed by whispers or private communication  but this writer adds insults to his injuries , and at once reproaches and defies us .


I beg leave to move , therefore , that the house do censure this paper as `` a malicious and scandalous libel , highly and injuriously reflecting upon a just and wise act of his majesty 's government , and also upon the proceedings of both houses of senate  and tending to create jealousies in the minds of the people . ''
I also move , `` that the author may be ordered to attend , to be examined at our bar . ''


[ This was unanimously agreed to by the house .
The doorkeeper was called in , and , being shown the paper , was asked from whom he received it ?
who answered , that he believed the person who delivered it to him , was then detained in one of the committee rooms , upon which he was ordered to look for , and fetch him to the bar . ]


Mr. SANDYS , taking notice that the person was already in custody , said , that he should be glad to know by what authority .
It was not reasonable to punish first , and judge afterwards .


Upon which sir William YONGE replied , that he had caused him to be detained , in order to know the pleasure of the house  and that he thought it his duty to secure so enormous an offender from escaping .


Soon after , the doorkeeper brought the man in , when he declared , upon examination , his name and his profession , which was that of a scrivener , and owned with great openness , that he was the author of the paper .
He was then asked who was the printer , and answered that he printed it himself .
Which he explained afterwards , by saying , that as he had carried it to the printer 's , he might be said , in the general acceptation of the term , as applied to an author , to be the printer .
He then discovered the printer , and was asked , where was the original manuscript , which he said he had destroyed , as he did any other useless paper .


It having been observed by some of the members , that it was printed in one of the daily papers , he was asked , who carried it thither ?
and answered , that he carried it himself .
It was then demanded , what he gave for having it inserted , and he answered that he gave nothing .


[ After many questions , Mr. Henry ARCHER desired that he might be asked , whether on the Friday before he was in the gallery  at which some of the members expressed their disapprobation , and the man being ordered to withdraw , the following debate ensued upon the propriety of the question . ]


Mr. SANDYS spoke first , in substance as follows : -- Sir , those who are intrusted by their country with the authority of making laws , ought , undoubtedly , to observe them with the utmost circumspection , lest they should defeat their own endeavours , and invalidate , by their example , their own decrees .


There is no part , sir , of our civil constitution more sacred , none that has been more revered by those that have trampled upon other forms of justice , and wantoned in oppression without restraint , than that privilege by which every Briton is exempted from the necessity of accusing himself , and by which he is entitled to refuse an answer to any question which may be asked , with a view to draw from him a confession of an offence which can not be proved .


Whether this great privilege , sir , is not violated  whether the unalienable right of a free subject is not infringed , by the question put to the person at our bar , the house must decide .
The punishment to which intruders are subject by the orders of this house , proves that his presence in the house is considered as a crime , of which , as we have no proof of it , a confession ought not to be extorted by an artful and insidious question , of which he may not discover the intention or the consequence .
Such treatment , sir , is rather to be expected by slaves in the inquisition of Spain , than a Briton at the bar of this house  a house instituted to preserve liberty , and to restrain injustice and oppression .


Mr. CAMPBELL spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , I can not but concur with the opinion of the honourable gentleman , that , in requiring an answer to this question , we shall expose a man to a punishment against whom we have no evidence , but what is extorted from himself  and , consequently , no knowledge of his crime upon which we can proceed to inflict censures or penalties , without the manifest infraction of our constitution .


It can not be imagined , sir , that he intends to confess himself guilty of a crime of which no proof has been brought , or that he will voluntarily subject himself to punishments .
It must , therefore , follow , that he is entrapped in his examination , by an artifice , which , I hope , will never find any countenance in this house .


Mr. WINNINGTON answered to the following purpose : -- Sir , it is not impossible that the honourable gentlemen , having not lately looked into the orders of the house , may mistake the tendency of the question  I , therefore , move that the order may be read .


[ The order being read by the clerk , he proceeded . ]


It is evident , sir , that by the order now read , the serjeant at arms attending on this house , may take into custody all strangers that shall be found in the house or gallery while we are assembled  and that this order is not always put in practice , must be attributed to the lenity of the house .
But that this order extends to past offences , and subjects any man to imprisonment for having been present in some former day , can not be conceived .
For how far may such a retrospect be extended ?
or at what time , after having intruded into the house , can any man presume to consider himself as exempt from the danger of imprisonment ?


Our order , sir , only decrees present punishment for present offences , and , therefore , the question asked by the honourable gentleman , may be insisted on without scruple , and answered without hazard .
Let then the honourable gentlemen reserve their laudable zeal for our constitution till it shall be invaded by more important occasions .


Mr. SANDYS replied : -- Sir , what victory the honourable gentleman imagines himself to have gained , or whence proceeds all his wantonness of exultation , I am not able to discover .
The question only relates to the interpretation of one of our own orders , and is , therefore , not of the highest importance  nor can his success , in so trivial a debate , entitle him to great applause from others , or produce , in a person of his abilities , any uncommon satisfaction to himself .


But , whatever may be the pleasure of the victory , it must , at least , be gained before it can be celebrated  and it is by no means evident , that he has yet any reason to assure himself of conquest .


His interpretation , sir , of the order , which he has so confidently laid before the house , seems to me to have no foundation in reason or justice  for if it be an offence against the house to be present at our consultations , and that offence be justly punishable , why should any man be exempt from a just censure by an accidental escape ?
or what makes the difference between this crime and any other , that this alone must be immediately punished , or immediately obliterated , and that a lucky flight is equivalent to innocence ?


It is surely , sir , more rational to believe , that the house may punish any breach of its orders at a distant time , that if our censure is once eluded , it may be afterwards enforced  and , therefore , that the question put to the person at the bar ought not to be asked , because it can not safely be answered .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke next , in words to this effect : -- Sir , I can not but conceive that our order may extend its influence beyond the present moment , and that intrusions may be punished by the house on another day than that on which they were committed .


I am so far , sir , from being of opinion , that , to make the execution of this order valid , the house must sit , without interruption , from the time of the offence to that of the punishment , that if the gentlemen in the gallery were to be taken into custody , I should advise the serjeant to wait till the house should break up , and seize them as they should come out .


Sir William YONGE spoke next , in the manner following : -- Sir , if any such punishment were now intended , I should advise the gentlemen in the gallery to retire , indeed , but not to hide themselves like felons , or men proscribed by proclamation  for as the power of seizing any man in the house is sufficient to secure us from intrusion , there is no reason to extend it farther  and penalties are not , without reason , to be inflicted , neither has the house ever coveted the power of oppressing  and what else is unnecessary punishment ?


If , therefore , an intruder is not seized in the act of intrusion , he can not legally be imprisoned for it .
And any of the strangers , who now hear this debate , may retire to a very small distance from the house , and set the serjeant at arms at defiance .


Sir Robert WALPOLE then spoke to this effect : -- Sir , whether the question be proper or not , it seems very unnecessary to debate  because , however it be answered , it can not be of great importance : the man has already confessed himself the author of the libel , and may , therefore , be punished without farther examination .


That he is the real author , sir , I am not , indeed , convinced by his assertion , with whatever confidence it was made  for so far as his appearance enables me to judge of his education and sphere of life , it is not probable that he should be much versed in political inquiries , or that he should engage in the discussion of questions like this .


There appears , sir , in the paper before us , a more extensive knowledge of facts , a more accurate attention to commerce , more artful reasoning , and a more elevated style , than it is reasonable to expect from this man , whom , without pretending to determine the limits of his capacity , or the compass of his knowledge , I am , for my part , inclined to look upon as an agent to some other person of higher station , and greater accomplishments .


It is not uncommon , sir , for gentlemen to exercise their abilities , and employ their pens , upon political questions , and when they have produced any thing , which their complaisance for themselves equally hinders them from owning and suppressing , they are known to procure some person of inferiour rank , to take upon him , in publick , the character of the author , and to stand the danger of the prosecution , contenting themselves with the applause and admiration of their chosen friends , whom they trust with the important secret , and with whom they sit and laugh at the conjectures of the publick , and the ignorance of the ministry .


This , sir , is a frequent practice , not only with those who have no other employment , but , as I have sufficient reasons to believe , among some gentlemen who have seats in this house  gentlemen , whose abilities and knowledge qualify them to serve the publick in characters much superiour to that of lampooners of the government .


Mr. PULTENEY answered in terms to the following purpose : -- Sir , whether the man who confessed himself the author of the paper , has accused himself of what he did not commit , or has ingenuously and openly discovered the truth , it is beyond my penetration absolutely to decide  the frankness and unconcern with which he made the declaration , gave it , at least , the appearance of truth , nor do I discover any reason for doubting his sincerity .
Is there any improbability in the nature of the fact , that should incline us to suspect his veracity ?
Is there any apparent advantage to be gained by assuming a false character ?
Neither of those circumstances can be produced against him , and an assertion is to be admitted for its own sake , when there is nothing to invalidate it .


But the honourable gentleman , sir , appears to have a very particular reason for his doubts  a reason , which will , I hope , have no weight with any but himself .
By denying the paper to this man , he gives room for conjecture and suspicion to range far and wide , and wanton with whatever characters he shall think proper subjects for his amusement .
An author is now to be sought , and many diverting arguments may be brought by the dullest inquirer for fixing it upon one man , or denying it to another .


The honourable gentleman , sir , has given us a bold specimen of this kind of wit , by insinuating that it is the production of some one of the members of this house  a conjecture of which I am not able to find the foundation , and therefore imagine , that raillery rather than argument was intended .
But let the honourable gentleman recollect , that the chief excellence of raillery is politeness , to which he has surely paid little regard , in supposing that what has been unanimously condemned as a libel , has one of those who censured it for its author .


If I am particularly hinted at in this sagacious conjecture , I take this opportunity of declaring that I am equally ignorant of the whole affair with any other gentleman in this house  that I never saw the paper till it was delivered to me at the door , nor the author till he appeared at the bar .
Having thus cleared myself , sir , from this aspersion , I declare it as my opinion , that every gentleman in the house can safely purge himself in the same manner  for I can not conceive that any of them can have written a libel like this .
There are , indeed , some passages which would not disgrace the greatest abilities , and some maxims true in themselves , though perhaps fallaciously applied , and at least such an appearance of reasoning and knowledge , as sets the writer far above the level of the contemptible scribblers of the ministerial vindications : a herd of wretches whom neither information can enlighten , nor affluence elevate  low drudges of scurrility , whose scandal is harmless for want of wit , and whose opposition is only troublesome from the pertinaciousness of stupidity .


Why such immense sums are distributed amongst these reptiles , it is scarce possible not to inquire  for it can not be imagined that those who pay them expect any support from their abilities .
If their patrons would read their writings , their salaries would quickly be withdrawn  for a few pages would convince them , that they can neither attack nor defend , neither raise any man 's reputation by their panegyrick , nor destroy it by their defamation .


Sir Robert WALPOLE then spoke in the following manner : -- I hope it is not expected , that the heat with which one class of our political writers have been attacked by the honourable gentleman , should engage me to undertake their defence with the same earnestness .
I have neither interest enough in the question to awaken my passions , nor curiosity or leisure sufficient for such an examination of the writings on each side , as is necessary , before the superiority of any author above his brethren can he justly asserted .


It is no part , sir , of my employment or amusement to compare their arguments , or to balance their abilities  nor do I often read the papers of either party , except when I am informed by some that have more inclination to such studies than myself , that they have risen by some accident above their common level .


Yet that I may not appear entirely to desert the question , I can not forbear to say , that I have never , from these accidental inspections of their performances , discovered any reason to exalt the authors who write against the administration , to a higher degree of reputation than their opponents .
That any of them deserve loud applauses , I can not assert , and am afraid that all , which deserves to be preserved of the writings on either side , may be contracted to a very few volumes .


The writers for the opposition appear to me to be nothing more than the echoes of their predecessors , or , what is still more despicable , of themselves , and to have produced nothing in the last seven years , which had not been said seven years before .


I may , perhaps , be thought by some gentlemen of each class to speak contemptuously of their advocates , nor shall I think my own opinion less just for such a censure  for the reputation of controversial writers arises , generally , from the prepossession of their readers in favour of the opinions which they endeavour to defend .
Men easily admit the force of an argument which tends to support notions , that it is their interest to diffuse , and readily find wit and spirit in a satire pointed at characters which they desire to depress : but to the opposite party , and even to themselves , when their passions have subsided , and their interest is disunited from the question , those arguments appear only loud assertions , or empty sophistry  and that which was clamorously praised , discovers itself to be only impudence or low conceits  the spirit evaporates , and the malignity only remains .


If we consider , sir , what opposition of character is necessary to constitute a political writer , it will not be wondered that so few excel in that undertaking .
He that will write well in politicks , must at the same time have a complete knowledge of the question , and time to digest his thoughts into method , and polish his style into elegance  which is little less than to say , he must be at once a man of business , and a man of leisure  for political transactions are not easily understood , but by those who are engaged in them , and the art of writing is not attainable without long practice , and sedentary application .


Thus it happens that political writings are generally defective : for they are drawn up by men unacquainted with publick business , and who can , therefore , only amuse their readers with fallacious recitals , specious sophistries , or an agreeable style  or they are the hasty productions of busy negotiators , who , though they can not but excel the other class of writers in that which is of most importance , the knowledge of their subject , are yet rarely at leisure to display that knowledge to advantage , or add grace to solidity .


Writers of the latter sort appear but seldom , and most of our political papers are the amusements of leisure , or the expedients of want .


Whether the paper now before us is the produce of ease , or of necessity , I shall not determine  I have already offered my opinion , that the man who claims it is not the author , nor do I discover any reason for changing my sentiment : the question is a question merely of conjecture , since neither I nor the honourable gentleman attempt to offer any demonstrative proofs of our opinion .
If he has any to produce in favour of his own notions , let him lay them before you , but let him always forbear to impute to me assertions which I never uttered , and beware of representing me as declaring that I believe this paper the composition of some member of this house .


[ It was then debated , whether this offence should be punished by the authority of the house , or referred to the cognizance of some of the courts of judicature in Westminster hall , on which occasion Mr. HOWE spoke as follows :]


Sir , it is the duty of every part of the legislature , not only to preserve the whole system of our government unaltered and unimpaired , but to attend particularly to the support of their own privileges , privileges not conferred upon them by our ancestors , but for wise purposes .


It is the privilege of this house that we , and we only , are the judges of our own rights , and we only , therefore , can assign the proper punishment when they shall be presumptuously invaded .


If we remit this offender , who has attempted to debase the house in the opinion of the nation , to any inferiour court , we allow that court to determine , by the punishment that shall be inflicted , the importance of this assembly , and the value of the collective character of this house .


It therefore concerns us , in regard to our own dignity , and to the privileges of our successours , that we retain the cognizance of this crime in our own hands , in which it is placed by perpetual prescription and the nature of our constitution .


[ The house agreed to this , and the libeller was sent to the common jail of Middlesex , by warrant from the speaker . ]


Sir William YONGE then spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I am pleased with finding that the malice and indecency of this libel , has raised in the house a just resentment , and that the wretch , who , with a confidence so steady , and such appearance of satisfaction in his countenance , confesses , or rather proclaims himself the author , is treated as he deserves .
But let us not forget that the same degree of guilt always requires the same punishment , and that when the author of scandal is in prison , the printer and propagator of it ought not to be at liberty .


The printer of the daily news is surely the proper object of your indignation , who inserted this libel in his paper , without the fondness of an author , and without the temptation of a bribe  a bribe , by the help of which it is usual to circulate scurrility .
To this man the expense or labour of aspersing the government was recompensed by the pleasure , and he could not prevail on himself to omit any opportunity of incensing the people , and exposing at once the whole legislature to censure and contempt .


Those , therefore , that have concurred in the imprisonment of the author , will doubtless join with me in requiring the attendance of his officious accomplice , and I can not forbear expressing my hopes , that he will not meet with kinder treatment .


It is far from being the first offence of his licentious press  and the lenity of the government , by which he has been so long spared , has had no other effect upon him , than to add confidence to his malice , and incite him to advance from one degree of impudence to another .


He has for several weeks persisted in misrepresenting the intention of the embargo , by letters pretended to be written by friends of the government who are injured by it .
He has vented his insinuations hitherto , as without punishment , so , as it appears , without fear .
It is time , therefore , to disturb his security , and restrain him from adding one calumny to another .


Sir John BARNARD rose up hereupon , and opposed this motion in terms to the following effect : -- Sir , the end of punishment is to prevent a repetition of the same crime , both in the offender , and in those who may have the same inclinations  and when that end is accomplished , all farther severities have an appearance rather of cruelty than justice .


By punishing the author of this libel , we have , in my opinion , sufficiently secured our dignity from any future attacks , we have crushed the head of the confederacy , and prevented the subordinate agents from exerting their malice .
Printers can do no injury without authors  and if no man shall dare to write a libel , it is not worthy of our inquiry how many may be inclined to publish it .


But if the printer must necessarily be punished before the resentment of the house can be satisfied  if it shall not be thought sufficient to punish him without whose assistance the other could not have offended  let us , at least , confine our animadversion to the present fault , without tracing back his life for past misdemeanours , and charging him with accumulated wickedness  for if a man 's whole life is to be the subject of judicial inquiries , when he shall appear at the bar of this house , the most innocent will have reason to tremble when they approach it .


Even with regard , sir , to the offence of which he is now accused , somewhat may , perhaps , be said in extenuation of his guilt , which I do not offer to gratify any personal affection or regard for him , to whom I am equally a stranger with any other gentleman in this house , but to prevent a punishment which may be hereafter thought disproportioned to the crime .


It is , sir , to be remembered , that he was not the original printer of the libel , which he only reprinted from a paper , of which he knew that it was to be dispersed at our door , and in which he could not naturally suspect any seditious or dangerous assertions to be contained .
It is , therefore , probable that he fell into the offence by ignorance , or , at worst , by inadvertency  and , as his intention was not criminal , he may properly be spared .


Mr. WINNINGTON spoke , in answer , to this effect : -- Sir , I can not but think the honourable gentleman betrayed , by his zeal for the defence of this man , into some assertions not to be supported by law or reason .
If it be innocent to print a paper once printed , will it not inevitably follow , that the most flagitious falsehoods , and the most enormous insults on the crown itself , the most seditious invectives , and most dangerous positions , may be dispersed through the whole empire , without any danger but to the original printer ?
And what reason , sir , can be assigned , why that which is criminal in one man , should be innocent in another ?


Nor is this the only position which has been advanced contrary to the laws of our country  for it has been asserted , that the general character of an offender is a consideration foreign from that of his immediate crime  and that whatever any man 's past life has been , he is only to be judged according to the evidence for the offence which is then the subject of examination .


How much this opinion is consistent with the practice of our courts , a very slight knowledge of their methods of proceeding will readily discover .
Is any villain there convicted but by the influence of his character ?
And is not the chief question at a trial the past conduct of the person at the bar ?


Sir John BARNARD rose here , and spoke thus : -- Sir , I rise up only to answer a question , which is , whether properly or not , put to me , and hope the irregularity will not be imputed to me , by the house , but to the occasion which produces it .


I am asked , whether it is not the chief question at the bar of our courts of justice , what is the character of the prisoner ?
and can not but feel some amazement that any man should be so ignorant of common proceedings , and so much unacquainted with the execution of our laws , as to have admitted a notion so chimerical .


The character of the prisoner is never examined , except when it is pleaded by himself , and witnesses are produced to offer testimony in his favour  that plea , like all others , is then to be examined , and is sometimes confuted by contrary evidence .
But , the character of a criminal , though it may be urged by himself as a proof of his innocence , is never to be mentioned by his prosecutor as an aggravation or proof of his guilt .
It is not required by the law , that the general character of a criminal , but that the particular evidence of the crime with which he stands charged , should be examined  nor is his character ever mentioned but by his own choice .


Sir William YONGE spoke next , to the effect following : -- Sir , to prove the malignity of the intention with which this libel was inserted in the daily paper , it can not be improper to observe , that the embargo has been for many days past the favourite topic of this printer , and that , therefore , it was not by accident that he admitted so zealous an advocate for his opinions to be seasonably assisted by the circulation of his paper , but that he , doubtless , was delighted with an opportunity of dispersing sedition by means of greater abilities than his own .


Nor can it be justly pleaded , sir , in his favour , that he was encouraged to publish it by the confidence with which he saw it dispersed  for it was printed by him in the morning , and not brought hither till the afternoon .
I can not , therefore , but conclude , that his intentions were agreeable to his practice , and that he deserves to accompany the author in his present confinement .


The advocate , CAMPBELL , spoke next , to this purpose : -- Sir , I hope it will not be imputed to me as disregard of the government , or neglect of the honour of this house , that I declare myself , on all occasions like this , inclined to lenity , and think it necessary always to proceed by regular methods , and known forms of justice , not by capricious determinations , and orders variable at pleasure .


I opposed the imprisonment of the man who just now appeared at the bar of our house , and am still more unwilling to proceed to severities against another , who is criminal only in a subordinate degree .
The loudest declaimers against these men can not have stronger detestation of falsehood and sedition than myself  but however flagrant may be the crimes , they may be punished with unjustifiable rigour , and , in my opinion , we have already proceeded with severity sufficient to discourage any other attempts of the same kind .


Whether it will promote the advantage of the publick , and the efficacy of our deliberations , to deter any man from the common practice of giving us information by delivering papers at our door , must be considered by the house .


Nor is it less worthy of our most attentive inquiry , whether it is not more reasonable to prosecute this offender in the common forms of justice , than to punish him by any act of uncontroulable , unaccountable authority ?
Whether it is not more reasonable to have him prosecuted before a judge unprejudiced , and a disinterested jury , than to act at once as party , evidence , and judge ?
I have no desire , sir , of diminishing the privileges of this house  and yet less would I contribute to establish any precedents of unlimited power or arbitrary punishments .


The ATTORNEY GENERAL then spoke to the following effect : -- Sir , whence so much tenderness can arise for an offender of this kind , I am at a loss to discover , nor am I able to conceive any argument that can be produced for exempting from punishment the printer of a paper , which has been already determined , by the vote of the house , to be a scandalous libel , tending to promote sedition .


It has been , indeed , agreed , that there are contained in the paper some true positions , and some passages innocent , at least , and perhaps rational and seasonable .
But this , sir , is nothing more than to say , that the paper , flagitious as it is , might have been swelled to a greater degree of impudence and scurrility  that what is already too heinous to be borne , might , by greater virulence , become more enormous .


If no wickedness , sir , is to be checked till it has attained the greatest height at which it can possibly arrive , our courts of criminal judicature may be shut up as useless  and if a few innocent paragraphs will palliate a libel , treason may be written and dispersed without danger or restraint  for what libel was ever so crowded with sedition , that a few periods might not have been selected , which , upon this principle , might have secured it from censure .


The danger of discouraging intelligence from being offered at the door of our house , does not alarm me with any apprehensions of disadvantage to the nation  for I have not so mean an opinion of the wisdom of this assembly , as to imagine that they can receive any assistance from the informations of their officious instructors , who ought , in my opinion , sir , rather to be taught by some senatorial censure to know their own station , than to be encouraged to neglect their proper employments , for the sake of directing their governours .


When bills , sir , are depending , by which either the interest of the nation , or of particular men , may be thought to be endangered , it is , indeed , the incontestable right of every Briton to offer his petition at the bar of the house , and to deliver the reasons upon which it is founded .
This is a privilege of an unalienable kind , and which is never to be infringed or denied  and this may always be supported without countenancing anonymous intelligence , or receiving such papers as the authors of them are afraid or ashamed to own , and which they , therefore , employ meaner hands to distribute .


Of this kind , sir , undoubtedly , is the paper now under our consideration , of which I am far from imagining that it was drawn up by the man who declares himself the writer , and am , therefore , convinced of the necessity of calling the printer to the bar , that whatever the lenity or justice of this assembly may determine with regard to his punishment , he may be examined with respect to the real authors of the libel  and that our resentment may fall upon him , who has endeavoured to shelter himself by exposing another .


Counsellor ORD spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I am inclined to believe , that the persons associated in writing and dispersing this paper , whosoever they may be , are of no high rank , or considerable influence  as it is not likely that any man who had much to hazard , would expose himself to the resentment of the whole legislature  but let us not for that reason exert our superiority in wanton punishments , or tyrannise merely because we can not be resisted .
Let us remember that the same justice and the same humanity is due to the meanest , as the highest of our fellow-subjects  and that there is even less necessity of rigorous measures , as the attack is less formidable .


But , sir , there is one motive to moderation that has seldom been found less efficacious than the consideration of the laws of justice or humanity .
We ought to be withheld by regard to our posterity , and even to ourselves , from any exorbitant extension of our privileges .
We know , that authority once exerted , is claimed afterwards by prescription .
And who knows by what sudden rotation of power he may himself suffer by a precedent which he has concurred to establish , and feel the weight of that oppressive power which he first granted for the punishment of another ?


Mr. HOWE spoke thus : -- Sir , I am always unwilling to oppose any proposal of lenity and forbearance , nor have now any intention of heightening the guilt of this man by cruel exaggerations , or inciting the house to rigour and persecution .


But let us remember , sir , that justice and mercy are equally to be regarded , and while we pity the folly of a misguided , or , perhaps , a thoughtless offender , let us not suffer ourselves to be betrayed , by our compassion , to injure ourselves and our posterity .


This house , sir , has always claimed and exerted the privilege of judging of every offence against itself , a privilege so long established , and so constantly exercised , that I doubt whether the inferiour courts of judicature will take cognizance of an attack upon us  for how can they venture to decide upon a question of such importance without any form or precedent for their proceedings .


There seems also to be at this time , sir , an uncommon necessity for tenaciousness of our privileges , when , as some whispers , which have been wafted from the other house , inform us , a motion has been made in terms which might imply the subordination of this assembly , an assertion without foundation either in reason or justice , and which I shall always oppose as destructive to our rights , and dangerous to our constitution .


Let us , therefore , sir , retain in our hands the cognizance of this affair , and let the criminal either suffer his punishment from our sentence , or owe his pardon to our mercy .


[ It was agreed that the printer of the daily paper should attend next day , when , being called in , it was proposed that he should be asked , whether he printed the paper complained of .
It was objected to , for the same reason as the question about the author 's being in the gallery , because the answer might tend to accuse himself  and he being withdrawn , a debate of the same nature ensued , and the question being put whether he should be asked , if he be the person that printed the daily paper shown to him , which paper the house the day before resolved to contain a malicious and scandalous libel , etc. it was , on a division , carried in the affirmative , by two hundred and twenty-two against one hundred and sixty-three : accordingly he was called in again , and being asked the question , he owned that he printed the said paper from a printed copy which was left for him with one of his servants  and being asked what he had to allege in his justification or excuse for printing the said libel , he said that as he had before printed several other things which he had received from the said person , which had not given offence , he inserted part of the paper in his news , and which he should not have inserted , if he had thought it would have given offence to the house , and that he forbore to print the remainder , having heard that it had given offence .
Upon which he withdrew , and the house , after some debate , on a division , one hundred and eighty-eight to one hundred and forty-five , not only ordered him into the custody of the serjeant , but resolved to present an address to his majesty , that he would be pleased to give directions to his attorney general to prosecute him at law .


The first printer of the libel was also ordered into custody .
This was on the 3d of December , but the next day presenting his petition , expressing his sorrow for the offence , whereby he had justly incurred the displeasure of the house , and praying to be discharged , he was brought to the bar on the following day , received a reprimand on his knees , and was ordered to be discharged , paying his fees . ]


On the 12th , lord BARRINGTON presented a petition from the printer of the daily paper , expressing his sorrow , promising all possible care not to offend for the future , and praying to be discharged .


This petition being read , a motion was made , that the serjeant at arms do carry the petitioner to some court of law , to give security for his appearance to the prosecution to be carried on against him by the attorney general  which done , that he be discharged , paying his fees .


Sir William YONGE spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I know not for what reason this enormous offender is entitled to so much regard , or by what interest he has engaged so many , who , I doubt not , abhor his crimes , to pity his sufferings .


Had he been young and unexperienced , and seduced into the commission of this offence by artifice or persuasion , his act might have been reasonably considered rather as an errour than a crime , and it might have been proper to treat with lenity a delinquent neither obstinate nor malicious .


But how , sir , can this plea be urged in favour of a man , whose daily employment it has been , for these two years past , to misrepresent the public measures , to disperse scandal , and excite rebellion , who has industriously propagated every murmur of discontent , and preserved every whisper of malevolence from perishing in the birth .


The proper judge , sir , of this affair , is his majesty 's attorney general , who is not now in the house .
I am , therefore , for detaining him in custody , and for referring the consideration of farther proceedings against him to that gentleman , whose proper province it is to prosecute for the crown .


Mr. WALLER spoke next , to the following purpose : -- Sir , it is undoubtedly the duty of every man to oppose the introduction of new laws , and methods of oppression and severity , which our constitution does not admit  and what else is the mention of a prisoner 's character as an aggravation of his present offence ?


It is well known , and has been already asserted , upon this occasion , that in the lower courts of justice , though the prisoner may plead his character , in his own defence , his prosecutor is not at liberty to produce it to his disadvantage .
Even those who are cited to the bar for murder or for treason , are tried only by the evidence of that crime for which they are indicted .


That this house is not bound to strict forms , and is not accountable for the exercise of its power , is easily granted  but authority can not change the nature of things , and what is unjust in a lower court , would be in us not less unjust , though it may not be punishable .


* * * * *


It was replied that this question had been before sufficiently discussed .


The attorney general not being present , the debate was adjourned to the next sitting .


On the next day of the session , the lord BARRINGTON proposed , that the adjourned debate might be resumed , and several members interceded for the petitioner , that he might be released  to which it was objected , that it was not proper to release him , unless an information was lodged against him , without which he could not be held to bail  and the question being put , whether he should be released , was determined in the negative .


At the sixth sitting , the author of the libel , who was committed to the common prison of Middlesex , petitioned the house to permit him to implore pardon on his knees , and promising , by the strongest and most solemn assurances , not to offend again , was ordered to be discharged the next day , paying his fees .


On the forty-seventh sitting , the printer of the daily paper again petitioned the house , representing , that he most heartily bewailed his offence , that he was miserably reduced by his confinement , having borrowed money of all his friends to support himself , his wife , and children , and praying the mercy of the house .
He was then ordered to be discharged , paying his fees , and giving security for his appearance to answer the prosecution .


On the eighty-fifth day , Mr. George Heathcote offered another petition for the said printer , and represented , that the fees amounting to one hundred and twenty-one pounds , he was not able to pay them , that , therefore , he hoped the house would consider his case  but the petition was not allowed to be brought up .
On which he remained in custody fourteen days longer , till the end of the session , and , the authority of the senate ceasing , had his liberty without paying any fees .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , DEC. 4-11 , 1740 .


ON INCORPORATING THE NEW-RAISED MEN INTO THE STANDING REGIMENTS .


On the 4th of December , sir William YONGE , secretary at war , having presented to the house of commons an estimate of the expense of raising ten thousand men , the same was taken into consideration in a committee on the supply , and after debate agreed to .
At the report of this proceeding , on the 11th , another debate happened on a motion that the new-raised men should be incorporated into the standing regiments , etc. .


As in these two debates the arguments were the same , they are thrown into one , to prevent unnecessary repetitions .


Sir William YONGE opened the debate with respect to what he had delivered in the estimate , after the manner following : -- Sir , as this estimate has been drawn up after very accurate calculations and careful inquiries , I hope that no objections will be raised against it , and that the sum necessary for raising the new regiments will be very readily granted by that house , which voted the war necessary for which they are designed .


I hope it will be admitted as some proof of frugality , that this estimate requires less money than one that was laid before the senate in the reign of king William  for if it be considered , that since that time , the necessaries of life are become dearer , and that , therefore , all expenses are increased , it will appear to be the effect of the exactest economy , that the sum required for the same service is less .


I have heard , indeed , sir , that in conversation , the method of raising troops on this occasion has been censured as improper , and that in the opinion of some , whose judgment can not be entirely disregarded , it would be more reasonable to add more men to our regiments already established , than to raise new regiments with new officers .


The chief argument , sir , produced in support of their method of augmentation , is drawn from the necessity of publick frugality , a very popular topick , which never fails to produce favour and attention  for every man is naturally inclined to hear his friend , and to consider that man as performing the office of friendship , who proposes methods of alleviating his taxes .


Frugality is undoubtedly a virtue very necessary to the happiness of the nation , and such as there occur frequent occasions of inculcating to those who are intrusted with the superintendence of publick disbursements , but I am far from thinking that this estimate affords any opportunity for declamations of this kind , and am of opinion that the addition of new soldiers to each regiment , would , in reality , be more expensive .


It can not be denied , sir , that by augmenting the regiments , there would be immediately saved to the publick the expense of the officers which are necessary in the method now proposed  but it is to be considered how much the number of officers contributes to the regularity and discipline of the troops , and how much discipline and order promote their success .
It is to be considered , sir , that the most successful method of making war is undoubtedly the cheapest , and that nothing is more expensive than defeats .


If by raising the same number of men under fewer officers , we should give our enemies any advantage , if a single party should be cut off , a garrison forced , an expedition rendered fruitless , or the war protracted but a few months , where will be the advantage of this admired frugality ?
What would be the consequence , but the same or a greater expense , not to gain advantages , but to repair losses , and obviate the effects of our former parsimony ?


In private life , sir , it is common for men to involve themselves in expense , only by avoiding it  to repair houses at greater charges than new ones might be built , and to pay interest , rather than the debt .
Weak minds are frighted at the mention of extraordinary efforts , and decline large expenses , though security and future affluence may be purchased by them  as tender bodies shrink from severe operations , though they are the certain methods of restoring health and vigour .
The effects of this timidity are the same in both cases , the estate is impaired insensibly , and the body languishes by degrees , till no remedy can be applied .


Such examples , sir , are frequent , and the folly of imitating them is therefore greater , for who would pursue that track by which he has seen others led to destruction ?
Nor need we search for remote illustrations to discover the destructive tendency of unseasonable tenderness for the publick , for I believe the whole history of the wars of king William will prove , that too close an attention to parsimony is inconsistent with great achievements .


It may be expected that I , who can not claim any regard in this disquisition , from my own experience , should produce some decisive evidence in favour of the method which I have taken upon me to defend  this expectation I shall endeavour to satisfy , by alleging the authority of the greatest commander of later ages , whom neither his friends nor his enemies will deny to have been well versed in these subjects , and whose success is a sufficient proof of the soundness of his principles .


The illustrious duke of MARLBOROUGH was of opinion , that the whole force of the French armies consisted in the number of the officers , and that to be always equal to them in the field , it was necessary to form our troops nearly upon the same plan  to this scheme he conformed in his practice of war , and how much his practice confirmed his opinion , let Blenheim and Ramillies attest .


As I pretend not to have determined myself on this question , otherwise than by authority , and , as I know not any authority equal to that of the duke of MARLBOROUGH , I can not discharge the trust reposed in me by my country , any otherwise , than by proposing , that , on this occasion , we agree to grant his majesty the sum calculated for raising the new regiments , as I believe that method of augmentation most likely to produce success in our undertakings , and consequently to procure a speedy conclusion of the war .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , I have been so long accustomed to the debates of this house , and have so often attended to the eloquence of the right honourable gentleman , that I am never startled at paradoxes , nor shocked at absurdities  I can now hear with great tranquillity an harangue upon the necessity of placemen in this house , upon the usefulness of standing armies , and the happiness of a general excise .


I am no longer offended with facts quoted in opposition to history , nor with calculations drawn up without regard to the rules of arithmetick  I know that there are persons in this house , who think themselves obliged to speak , even when in their own opinion nothing can be said with weight or with propriety  who come hither prepared against the shame of confutation , and determined not to be convinced .


To reason with such men , sir , is , indeed , no pleasing task  it is to fight with enchanted heroes , upon whom the common weapons of argument have no effect , and who must be softened by a countercharm , before they can be attacked with any prospect of success .


There are some , however , of whom I am willing to believe that they dispute only for truth , and inquire with the view of attaining a solution of their doubts .
For the sake of these , sir , I think it necessary to declare my sentiments , as I shall be desirous , in my turn , to hear their sentiments  but with regard to those whose opinion I know already by their posts , I should think it of great advantage to the despatch of publick affairs , if they would content themselves with voting for their pay , without any ambition of other service , or adding the praise of volubility to that of steadiness .


Having this opportunity , sir , of declaring my opinion of the measures pursued in regulating our military preparations , I shall not confine myself entirely to the present question , but lay before the house my thoughts upon some parts of the establishment , which may , perhaps , require a reform , and which are at least proper objects of consideration , though not absolutely necessary to the determination of our opinion upon the present motion .


I have long ago , sir , declared , what , therefore , it is scarcely of any use to repeat , that I know not any advantage to be hoped from a standing army , nor can discover why the ablest and most vigorous of the inhabitants of this kingdom should be seduced from the loom , the anvil and the plough , only to live at ease upon the labour of industry , only to insult their landlords , and rob the farmers .
I never could find why any body of men should be exempt from the common labour of social duties , or why they should be supported by a community , who contribute neither to its honour nor its defence .


I doubt not , sir , but I shall hear , on this occasion , of the service of our troops in the suppression of riots  we shall be told , by the next pompous orator who shall rise up in defence of the army , that they have often dispersed the smugglers  that the colliers have been driven down by the terrour of their appearance to their subterraneous fortifications  that the weavers , in the midst of that rage which hunger and oppression excited , fled at their approach  that they have at our markets bravely regulated the price of butter , and , sometimes , in the utmost exertion of heroick fury , broken those eggs which they were not suffered to purchase on their own terms .


Some one , perhaps , of more penetration , may inform us of the use which has been made of them at elections , where the surly burgesses have been sometimes blind to the merit of those worthy gentlemen , whom the soldiers have known how to esteem according to their desert  nor , indeed , do I see how those can refuse their votes in favour of our troops , who are indebted for the power of giving them , to their kind interposition .


To these arguments , sir , I shall content myself with answering , that those who are versed in the history of Britain , know that we have had colliers and weavers for many years before a standing army was heard of among us , and that it is , nevertheless , nowhere recorded that any of our kings were deposed by those formidable bodies of men , or that any remarkable changes were made by them in the form of our government  and , therefore , till some reason shall be alleged , why such insurrections are now more dangerous , and our civil magistrates more impotent than in former ages , I humbly conceive , that even without the protection of a standing army , we might yet sleep in security , notwithstanding the plots of the colliers , and the combinations of the weavers .


But I must own , sir , these are not our only enemies , for there is somewhere , yet in existence , a person that lays claim to the dominion of these kingdoms , and pleads an hereditary title to dispose of our wealth , to subvert our liberties , and destroy our religion .


If any foreigner , sir , unacquainted with our affairs , were to be present at our debates , and to hear with what ardour we animate each other to an obstinate resistance of this pretender to the throne , how often he is represented as hovering over us , and how often we have caught a general panick , and imagined ourselves upon the verge of destruction , how often our most zealous patriots take opportunities of declaring their resolution to die in defence of their liberties  and how pathetically our most elegant declaimers have expatiated on the misery of that unhappy race , whom they should leave behind to groan under the oppression of absolute power , what would be his opinion of this pretender , whom he saw so perpetually dreaded , against whom so many alliances were formed , so many armies were levied , and so many navies equipped ?


Would he not believe him to be some formidable tyrant in a neighbouring country , the lord of wide dominions , and the master of numerous armies and powerful fleets ?
Would he not imagine that he could assemble half the continent at his call , that he was supported by powerful alliances , and that nothing but a fair wind was required to land him on our coasts at the head of millions ?
And would he not , even on that supposition , be inclined to censure us as timorous , as somewhat regardless of the honour of our nation , and condemn us for giving way to such suspicions and exclamations , as have a natural tendency to heighten the apprehension of danger , and depress the spirits of the people ?


But what would be his conclusion , sir , when he should be told , what in reality is true , that this dreadful pretender is an unhappy fugitive , driven in his infancy from this country , and by consequence without any personal interest  that he is supported by the charity of a prince whose name is hated almost by every inhabitant of the kingdom  that he has neither sovereignty , nor money , nor alliances , nor reputation in war , nor skill in policy  that all his actions are watched by British spies  and that the few friends that remain to support the farce of a court , are such only as dare not return to their native country , and are , therefore , without fortune , and without dependants ?


What could a wise man conceive of a nation held in continual alarms by an enemy like this  of a nation always watchful against an invasion from a man who has neither dominions to supply , nor money to hire a single regiment  from a man whose title all the neighbouring princes disown , and who is at such a distance from them , that he can not be assisted by them without open preparations , of which we can not fail of having intelligence , and which may be defeated , without danger , by the vessels regularly stationed on our coasts ?


Would not any stranger imagine , sir , that we were a nation infected with a general phrensy , that cowardice had perverted our imaginations , filled us with apprehensions of impossible invasions , raised phantoms before our eyes , and distracted us with wild ideas of slavery and tyranny , oppression and persecution ?


I have dwelt thus long on this point , because I know the pretender is the last refuge of those who defend a standing army  not that I propose to convince any man of the folly of such apprehensions , or to fortify him against such terrours for the time to come  for if any man , in reality , now dreads the pretender , fear must be his distemper  he is doomed to live in terrours , and it is of no importance whether he dreads an invasion or a goblin , whether he is afraid to disband the army , or to put out his candle in the night  his imagination is tainted , and he must be cured , not by argument , but by physick .


But the greatest part of those who disturb our consultations with the mention of the pretender , are men of a very different character , men equally unconcerned about his designs , or his motions , with those who are most desirous of setting the nation free from the burden of an army , and very often such as we may discover , from their conduct , to be determined to comply with every government  and such as have , therefore , nothing to fear from a change of masters .


The men , for whose sake I am now speaking , sir , laugh equally with myself at the apprehensions of those whom they contribute to terrify  they know too well the impotence of the pretender to dread an invasion from him , and affect only to continue their outcries , that they may not be deprived of a topick , on which , by long practice , they have attained an uncommon facility of haranguing , which they know how to diversify with various combinations of circumstances , and how to accommodate to any emergent occasion , without the pain of torturing their inventions .


It may be useful , sir , to inform these men , that their disguise ought at last to be thrown off , because it deceives no longer , and that the nation can not be cheated but at the expense of more cunning than they are willing , or perhaps able , to display .
A mask must necessarily be thrown aside , when , instead of concealing , it discovers him by whom it is used .


Those who are attempting , sir , to deceive others , and whose character is exalted , in their own opinion , in proportion to the success of their endeavours , have surely a sense of shame , though they have none of virtue , and can not , without pain , find their artifices detected , and themselves made the objects of ridicule , by those stratagems which they employ for the deception of others .


I hope , therefore , sir , that , for their own sakes , these declaimers on the exploded story of the pretender , will change their bugbear , that if it be necessary to frighten those whom they want art or eloquence to persuade , they will find out some other object of terrour , which , after a little practice in private meetings , they may first produce in the court , and then turn loose in the senate .


The world , methinks , allows them a sufficient choice of tyrants more formidable than the pretender .
Suppose they should revive the history of the Mohocks .
The Mohocks are a dreadful race , not to be mentioned without horrour , by a true lover of his country , and a steady adherent to the house of Hanover  they might then very easily increase our army , or enhance our taxes  for who would not be urged by his wife and daughter to agree to any measures that might secure them from the Mohocks ?


But as an army is , at present , likely to be kept up for our defence , against an enemy less formidable , it may be more seasonable to propose the regulation than the dismission of our troops , and to mention those evils which arise from the present establishment , rather than those which are inseparable from the expense of a standing force .


If it be necessary , sir , to support soldiers , I suppose that it will not be denied by the advocates for an army , that we ought to levy such troops as may be of use  yet in their practice they seem to have paid very little regard to this principle .
Our troopers are mounted upon horses which can serve no purpose but that of show , which may , indeed , wheel about in the park with a formidable air , but can neither advance upon an enemy with impetuosity , nor retreat from him with expedition  and which , therefore , though purchased by the nation at a very high price , and supported at a large expense , can only grace a review , but are of very little use in an enemy 's country , and must perish in the march , or stand unactive in the battle .


Nor is much more service to be expected , sir , from their riders , than from the horses , for there are very few of them acquainted with the first elements of their profession , or who have ever learned more than a few postures of exercise , and the meaning of a few words of command , but have a number of officers with large appointments .


The French troops , sir , if they are doubly officered , are officered and maintained at a less expense , and to greater effect  for the soldiers are better instructed , and the same number of men cost not , perhaps , much more than half the charge of a British regiment .


The guards , sir , that are maintained about this metropolis , for no other purpose than to keep up the splendour of a modern court , cost the nation , yearly , such a sum as would be sufficient to support an army of Frenchmen , for the protection of their frontier towns , or the invasion of neighbouring countries .


For my part , I can not see what injury would be done to the nation by abolishing an establishment , at the same time useless and expensive , and employing that money which is at present squandered upon idlers without effect , upon levies of useful soldiers for marching regiments , who might be employed , when occasion should require them , in the service of their country .


It will , doubtless , be objected , that the officers of this body of men , many of whom are persons of the highest merit , and who have , generally , purchased their commissions , might very justly complain of being deprived , without a crime , of that which they have bought at its full value , and to which , therefore , they imagine themselves entitled , till they shall forfeit their right by some offence against the laws , or some neglect of their duty .


I shall not , sir , at present , inquire into the justness of this plea , nor examine , whether he who purchases an employment , which he knows to be useless , and therefore burdensome to the publick , deserves that the publick should be solicitous to support him in the enjoyment of it  but I shall declare , on this occasion , with confidence , that I know many of the officers of the guards to be men of honour , who would gladly exchange their posts , so chargeable to the nation , for an opportunity of serving it , and who are not very anxious for the increase of their pay , so they may not be degraded from their present rank .


If these gentlemen , sir , might , in the regiments that should be raised by disbanding the guards , be advanced to higher commissions , though with some diminution of their pay , they would imagine themselves abundantly compensated by the happiness of becoming useful subjects , and serving that nation by which they have been , hitherto , supported only to fill up the pomp of levees , and add to the magnificence of drawing-rooms , to loiter in antechambers , and to quarrel at gaming tables .


If this scheme should not be approved , the method eligible , in the next degree , seems to be that of incorporating our new levies into the regiments already raised , that being associated with men already acquainted with discipline , they may learn their duty much more expeditiously than in separate bodies , where one officer will be obliged to attend to the instruction of great numbers , and where no man will be excited to application , because no man will see any degree of excellence which he may be ambitious of attaining .


I have , indeed , heard no reason alleged for the necessity of new levies , which appeared likely to convince even those by whom it was produced .
It appears to me that our present army is more than sufficient for the publick service , without an augmentation , and that some of our regiments might immediately embark , not only without danger to the nation , but with far greater hopes of success , as our enemies would have less time to strengthen their fortifications , and collect their troops , and as disciplined forces are more formidable than troops newly levied  for discipline must be of great efficacy to the success of military undertakings , or all arguments which have been used in the defence of a standing army fall to the ground .


In answer to this proposal , we shall probably be once again intimidated with an invasion , whether from the pretender , the Spaniards , the French , or any other power , it is of no great importance .
An invasion is a formidable sound  the sack of towns , the destruction of villages , the captivity of our children , the ruin of our fortunes , and the desolation of our country , are frightful images , and may , therefore , be successfully produced , on this occasion , to perplex our thoughts , and embarrass our inquiries .


To remove , therefore , this panick , and to dissipate , for ever , the phantoms of invasion , I will lay before the house the opinion of the great commander whose name has already been introduced in this debate .
In the late reign , on a day when the great officers of the crown , and many of the council , were at a publick feast in the city , a report was suddenly spread that the duke of Ormond had landed in the west , with two thousand men .
This account was , in appearance , well attested , and universally believed  all jollity was , therefore , at an end , the company departed , the council was summoned , and every man offered such expedients as his present thoughts , confused and oppressed with the proximity of the danger , suggested to him .
One proposed , that a body of troops should be sent to a distant part of the kingdom , to restrain the seditions of the populace  another apprehended more danger from a different quarter , and advised that the inhabitants should be awed by another detachment sent thither  the most experienced easily saw the unprofitableness of the measures proposed , but could not so easily strike out more efficacious expedients , and therefore sat in great perplexity .
Lord Somers , particularly , shook his head , and seemed to consider the kingdom as in the hands of the invaders , and the dreadful pretender as seated on the throne .


At last , the duke of MARLBOROUGH , who had hitherto sat silent , asked calmly , whether they were certain that any forces were really landed , and was answered , that though it might not be absolutely certain , yet they were to consult and send orders upon that supposition .
Then , says he , I will lay down this great rule to be observed invariably , whenever you are invaded .
Attend only to one point , nor have any other purpose in view than that of destroying the regular forces that shall be landed in the kingdom , without any regard to petty insurrections , which may be always easily quelled , and which will probably cease of themselves , when the army by which they were excited is cut off .
For this end , let it be your rule , to keep your army undivided , and to make no motion but towards the enemies  fight them with the utmost expedition before they can fortify themselves , or receive reinforcements from the continent .
By the observation of this plain method of operation , continued he , I will engage , without any other force than the regiments generally stationed about the capital , to put a stop to any troops that shall be landed on the coast of Britain .


So far was this great officer , who was acquainted with the whole art of war , from sinking into astonishment at the sound of an invasion , and so far from thinking it necessary that the nation should be harassed by standing troops , to preserve it from being plundered by a foreign army .


But though our troops , sir , should not be necessary to prevent an invasion , they may be useful in services of equal importance  the ministry may think the suffrages of the officers more serviceable than their swords , and may be more afraid of exposing themselves than the nation by any detachment of their forces .


Such is , at present , sir , the state of this unhappy country , that neither in peace nor war are any measures taken , but with a view of increasing or confirming the power of the ministry  for this purpose those troops whose officers have seats here , are to be retained at home , and the fate of our American settlements to be committed to new-levied forces , without military skill .


For this reason is an army to be raised without necessity , and raised in a manner that may furnish the court with an opportunity of extending its influence , by the disposal of great numbers of new commissions .
By this plan every family that is burdened with a relation whose vices have ruined his fortune , or whose stupidity disqualifies him for employment , will have an opportunity of selling , for a commission , its interest at the approaching election  dependence will be propagated , and the troublesome spirit of liberty be depressed .


To little purpose will it be objected , that soldiers and officers will be equally ignorant , that discipline is not infused instantaneously , that a military dress will not make a soldier , that men can only know their duty by instruction , and that nothing is to be hoped from ploughmen and manufacturers , commanded by schoolboys .
The success of the expedition is not so much considered by those who have the direction of the levies , as that of the election , and while they keep their posts , they are very little concerned about the affairs of America .


In defence of this method , it has , indeed , been affirmed , that it was preferred by the duke of MARLBOROUGH  but we are not informed to whom , or upon what occasion he declared his opinion , and , therefore , are left at liberty to doubt , whether his authority is not produced for a method which he did not approve , or approved only at some particular time for some extraordinary service .


It is urged , that he recommended it by his practice , and that his success is a sufficient proof that his practice was founded upon right maxims .
But if it be remembered what was , in that time , the method of obtaining commissions , and who it was that had the disposal of them , it will appear not absolutely certain , that his practice ought to be produced as a decisive proof of his opinion .


If the success of troops be properly urged as an argument for the form of their establishment , may not the victories of prince Eugene afford a proof , equally convincing , that a few officers are sufficient ?
And if the arguments which arise from success are equal on both sides , ought not the necessity of saving the publick money to turn the balance ?


War , sir , is in its own nature a calamity very grievous to the most powerful and flourishing people , and to a trading nation is particularly destructive , as it at once exhausts our wealth , and interrupts our commerce , at once drinks up the stream and chokes up the fountain .
In those countries whose affairs are wholly transacted within their own frontiers , where there is either very little money , or where their wealth is dug out of their own mines , they are only weakened by the loss of men , or by the diminution of their dominions , and , in general , can only suffer by being overcome .


But the state of Britain is far different  it is not necessary to our ruin that an enemy should be stronger than ourselves , that he should be able to pour armies into our country , to cover the sea with fleets , to burn our villages by incursions , or destroy our fortresses with bombs  for he that can secure his own dominions from our attacks , to which nothing but distance and some advantages of situation are necessary , may support a war against us , and he that can fit out privateers to interrupt our trade , may , without obtaining a victory , reduce us to distress .


Our situation , sir , as it preserves us from the danger of an invasion , except from that powerful monarch , the pretender , who is , indeed , always to be dreaded , has , likewise , the effect of securing other nations from being invaded by us  for it is very difficult to transport in one fleet , and to land at one time , a number sufficient to force their way into a country where the ports are fortified , and the inhabitants in arms .


Our wars , sir , are , therefore , to be determined by naval battles , and those nations have very little to fear from us who have no trade to be disturbed , and no navies to be destroyed  if they can only fit out cruisers , which may always be done by granting commissions to foreign adventurers , they may ruin our merchants by captures , exhaust the nation by the necessity of convoys , and give neutral traders an opportunity of establishing their credit at those markets which have been , hitherto , supplied by our manufactures .


This is , indeed , far from being at present an exact account of the state of Spain , whose wide-extended dominions are liable to insults , and from whom many of her most wealthy provinces may be torn without great hazard or difficulty .
The particular state of her commerce , which , being only carried on from one part of her dominions to another , can only be for a time interrupted , but is in no danger of being invaded by any rival , or lost by disuse , at least requires our consideration , and we ought to make war with the utmost frugality , against a people whom no hostilities can really impoverish , whose commerce may be said to lie at rest rather than to be shackled , as it will rise into greater vigour at the end of the war , and whose treasures , though the want of them is a present inconvenience , are only piled up for a time of security .


As the only method , sir , of reducing this nation , must be that of invading its colonies , and dismembering its provinces , by which the chief persons will be deprived of their revenues , and a general discontent be spread over the people , the forces which are levied for this expedition , an expedition on which so much of the honour of our arms and the prosperity of our trade must necessarily depend , ought to be selected with the greatest care , and disciplined with the exactest regularity .


On this occasion , therefore , it is surely improper to employ troops newly collected from shops and villages , and yet more irrational to trust them to the direction of boys called on this occasion from the frolicks of a school , or forced from the bosoms of their mothers , and the softness of the nursery .
It is not without compassion , compassion very far extended , that I consider the unhappy striplings doomed to a camp , from whom the sun has hitherto been screened , and the wind excluded , who have been taught , by many tender lectures , the unwholesomeness of the evening mists and the morning dews , who have been wrapt in furs in winter , and cooled with fans in summer , who have lived without any fatigue but that of dress , or any care but that of their complexion .


Who can forbear , sir , some degree of sympathy , when he sees animals like these taking their last farewell of the maid that has fed them with sweetmeats , and defended them from insects  when he sees them drest up in the habiliments of soldiers , loaded with a sword , and invested with a command , not to mount the guard at the palace , nor to display their lace at a review  not to protect ladies at the door of an assembly room , nor to show their intrepidity at a country fair , but to enter into a kind of fellowship with the rugged sailor , to hear the tumult of a storm , to sustain the change of climates , and to be set on shore in an enemy 's dominions ?


Surely , he that can see such spectacles without sorrow , must have hardened his heart beyond the common degrees of cruelty , and it may reasonably be expected , that he who can propose any method by which such hardships may be escaped , will be thought entitled to gratitude and praise .


For my part , I should imagine , sir , that an easy method might be discovered of obviating such misery , without lessening that number of officers , which , perhaps , in opposition to reason and experience , some gentlemen will continue to think necessary , and hope that this may be no improper time to declare my opinion .


I have observed , that for some time no private centinel has ever risen to any rank above that of a serjeant , and that commissions have been reserved as rewards for other services than those of the camp .
This procedure I can not but think at once impolitick and unjust .


It is impolitick , sir , as it has a natural tendency to extinguish in the soldiery all emulation and all industry .
Soldiers have an equal genius with other men , and undoubtedly there might be found among them great numbers capable of learning and of improving the military sciences  but they have , likewise , the same love of ease , and the desire of honour and of profit , and will not condemn themselves to labour without the prospect of reward , nor sacrifice their time to the attainment of that knowledge , which can have no other effect than to make them discover the stupidity of their commanders , and render their obedience more difficult , as it will destroy that reverence which is necessary to subordination .


It is unjust , sir , because it is not to be doubted , that some soldiers , by the natural force of their faculties , or by a laudable activity of mind , have extended their knowledge beyond the duties of a private station  and he that excels in his profession , has an equitable claim to distinction and preferment .
To advance any man in the army , because his father is an orator in the senate , or the chief inhabitant of a borough , seems not more rational , than to make another man a judge , because some of his ancestors were skilled in gunnery  nor would the lawyers have juster reasons for complaint in one case , than the soldiers in the other .


It is , therefore , sir , in my opinion , necessary to the advancement of military knowledge , that , as a centinel is , for excelling in his profession , advanced to the degree of a serjeant , the serjeant , who continues his application , and performs his duty , should , in time , be honoured with a commission .


It may be objected , indeed , that serjeants , though they are skilful commanders in war , can very seldom arrive at any remarkable skill in politicks , and though they should be so fortunate as to gain estates , could never be of any use as the representatives of a borough  and to what purpose should those men be advanced , who can only serve their country , but can contribute very little to the support of the court ?


This is , I own , sir , an objection , which I despair of answering to the satisfaction of those by whom it will be raised .
The hardy serjeant would never cringe gracefully at a levee , would never attain to any successful degree of address in soliciting votes  and if he should by mere bribery be deputed hither , would be unable to defend the conduct of his directors .


In vindication of the present scheme , I believe few of those rugged warriours would find many arguments  they would not recommend to the nation a troop of boys , under the command of boys , as the most proper forces to be sent to make conquests in distant countries , nor would imagine , that unskilful soldiers could , under the direction of officers equally ignorant with themselves , attain the knowledge of their duty in the same time as if they were incorporated with regular troops , in which every man might receive instructions , and learn his business from his comrade .


I had lately , sir , the opportunity of hearing the opinion of one of the greatest generals in the world , on this subject , who declared , with the utmost confidence of certainty , that raw troops could be disciplined in a short time , only by being incorporated with those that had been already taught their duty , and asserted , that with an army so mixed , he should think himself sufficiently enabled to meet any forces of the same number , and should not fear to acquit himself successfully , either in attacking or defending .


Such are the sentiments of this great man , to whom I know not whether any name can be opposed that deserves equally to be reverenced .
He has had the honour of defending the rights of his country in the senate as well as in the field , has signalized himself equally in the debate and in the battle , and , perhaps , deserves less regard for having hazarded his life , than for having been divested of his employments .


Since , therefore , it is apparent that great numbers of officers are by no means necessary to success in war , since they are dangerous to our liberty in time of peace , since they are certainly expensive , and at best not certainly useful  and since the greatest general of the present age has declared , that our new levies ought to be mingled with our standing forces , I shall think it my duty to vote against the present scheme of raising new regiments , and shall agree to no other supplies than such as may be sufficient for adding the same numbers to the present army .


General WADE then spoke as follows : -- Sir , though I can not pretend to pursue the honourable gentleman through the whole compass of his argument , nor shall attempt to stand up as his rival , either in extent of knowledge , or elegance of language , yet as my course of life has necessarily furnished me with some observations relating to the question before us , and my present station in the army may , in some measure , be said to make it my duty to declare my opinion , I shall lay before the house a few considerations , with the artless simplicity of a plain soldier , without engaging in a formal debate , or attempting to overthrow the arguments of others .


It is observed , sir , that for the greatest part , the farther any man has advanced in life , the less confidence he places in speculation , and the more he learns to rest upon experience , as the only sure guide in human affairs  and as the transactions in which he is engaged are more important , with the greater anxiety does he inquire after precedents , and the more timorously does he proceed , when he is obliged to regulate his conduct by conjecture or by deliberation .


This remark , sir , though it may be just with regard to all states of life , is yet more constantly and certainly applicable to that of the soldier  because , as his profession is more hazardous than any other , he must with more caution guard against miscarriages and errours .
The old soldier , therefore , very rarely ventures beyond the verge of experience , unless in compliance with particular accidents , which does not make any change in his general scheme , or in situations where nothing can preserve him but some new stratagem or unprecedented effort , which are not to be mentioned as part of his original plan of operation , because they are produced always by unforeseen emergencies , and are to be imputed , not to choice , but to necessity  for , in consequence of my first principle , an old soldier never willingly involves himself in difficulties , or proceeds in such a manner as that he may not expect success by the regular operations of war .


It will not , therefore , be strange , if I , who , having served in the army , in the wars of king William , may justly claim the title of an old soldier , should not easily depart from the methods established in my youth  methods of which their effects have shown me , that they at least answer the intention for which they were contrived , and which , therefore , I shall be afraid of rejecting , lest those which it is proposed to substitute in their place , however probable in speculation , should be found defective in practice , and the reasonings , which , indeed , I can not answer , should be confuted in the field , where eloquence has very little power .


The troops of Britain , formed according to the present establishment , have been found successful  they have preserved the liberties of Europe , and driven the armies of France before them  they have appeared equally formidable in sieges and in battles , and with strength equally irresistible have pressed forward in the field , and mounted the breach .
It may be urged , that this vigour , alacrity , and success , can not be proved to have been produced by the number of officers by whom they were commanded  but since , on the contrary , it can not be shown that the number of officers did not contribute to their victories , I think it not prudent to try the experiment , which , if it should succeed , as it possibly may , would produce no great advantage  and if it should fail , and that it may fail no man will deny , must bring upon us , not only the expense which we are so solicitous to avoid , but disgrace and losses , a long interruption of our trade , and the slaughter of great numbers of our fellow-subjects .


Thus far , sir , I have proceeded upon a supposition that the balance of argument is equal on both sides , and that nothing could be alleged on one part but experience , or objected to the other but the want of it  but as I am now called to declare my opinion in a question relating to my profession , a question of great importance to the publick , I should think that I had not discharged my duty to my country with that fidelity which may justly be exacted from me , if I should omit any observation that my memory may suggest , by which the house may be better enabled to proceed in this inquiry .


I think it , therefore , proper to declare , that we not only , in the last great war , experienced the usefulness of numerous officers , but that we have likewise felt the want of them on a signal occasion , and that the only great advantage which our enemies obtained , was gained over an army rendered weak by the want of the usual number of officers .
Such were the forces that were defeated at the fatal battle of Almanza , by which almost all Spain was recovered from us .
And it is , sir , the opinion of very skilful commanders , that the Germans , only by having fewer officers than the French , did not succeed in those long and obstinate battles of Parma and Guastalla .


It is , indeed , natural to imagine , that a greater number of officers must promote success , because courage is kindled by example , and it is , therefore , of use to every man to have his leader in his view .
Shame , at one time , and affection at another , may produce the effects of courage where it is wanted , and those may follow their commander , who are inclined to desert their duty  for it is seldom known that , while the officers appear confident , the soldiers despair , or that they think of retreating but after the example of their leaders .


Where there are only few officers , it is apparent that more is left to chance , in which it becomes not a wise man to place any confidence  for if the officers are killed at the beginning of the action , the soldiers must become an useless , defenceless herd , without order , without unanimity , and without design  but by the present method , if an officer happens to fall , his place is immediately supplied by another , the action goes forward , and the enemy receives no advantage from confusion or delay .


I am , therefore of opinion , that in raising troops for the expedition now intended , the established method ought to be followed , and that we ought not to hazard the success of our attempt by new regulations , of which no human sagacity can fortell the event .


Though it can not be denied , that some addition might be made to our companies without any visible or certain inconvenience , yet the augmentation now intended is too numerous to be so incorporated without some neglect of discipline , as the officers would be charged with more men than they could properly superintend .


There is , indeed , sir , another method of incorporation , by adding new companies to each regiment  but of this method the advantage would be small , because the number of captains and inferiour officers must be the same , and the pay of only the field officers would be saved , and this trifling gain would be far over-balanced by the inconveniencies which experience has shown to arise from it .
There have been regiments formed of thirteen companies , instead of ten  but it was found , that as the officers of a company may be over-charged with soldiers , a colonel may likewise have more companies than he can conveniently inspect , and the ancient regulation was restored , as the least liable to difficulties and objections .


Having thus endeavoured to vindicate the manner in which our new troops are proposed to be levied , it may be expected that I should now make some observations on the service in which they are to be employed , which I can not think liable to any unanswerable objection .
It is now , sir , in our choice whether we will send the new regiments abroad or keep them at home  and our choice may easily be determined by comparing the value of our colonies with that of their mother country .
If it be not necessary to have any army here to defend us against insults and invasions , the question about the manner of raising or employing new regiments is superfluous , because none ought to be raised , as our old troops are sufficiently numerous for foreign service .
But if the security of the nation requires an army , would it not be madness to send those troops to a distant part of the world , in which we can confide most !
Would not those , who speak with such contempt of an expedition undertaken by boys , have a better reason for their censure , if only boys were stationed on our coasts to repel the veterans of France ?
Would not such measures animate our enemies , and invite an invasion ?


It may , perhaps , be urged farther , that the troops which are sent into America , are more likely to succeed in their design , than any regiment of ancient establishment .
The chief danger to be feared in that part of the world , is not from the enemy but the climate , with which young men are most able to contend , though they may not be equally qualified for attempts in which skill is equally necessary with vigour .


I am convinced , sir , that this war has hitherto been prosecuted with ardour and fidelity , and that no measures have been taken but such as experience and reason have supported , and therefore affirm , without scruple , that if we are not successful , our miscarriages must be imputed to the chance of war , from which no prudence can exempt us .


Lord QUARENDON spoke next , in the following manner , being his first speech : -- Sir , having-but very lately had the honour of a seat in this assembly , I am conscious how little I am acquainted with either the subjects or forms of debate , and should , therefore , continue to listen to the sentiments of persons more experienced , with silent veneration , did I not observe with how much indulgence they are heard who mean well , however deficient in knowledge , or in eloquence .


As the honourable gentleman who spoke last , sir , professes to have formed his opinion rather from facts than arguments , I hope I shall be indulged by the house , in an attempt to examine those facts which he has produced , because I think them not sufficient to support his positions , which must , therefore , be established by some other proofs , before a decision of this question can be fixed by them .


With regard to his experience , to which undoubtedly no small degree of veneration is due , he confesses that we have tried only one of the two forms of establishment now in competition , and that , therefore , though he has had reason to approve that with which he is most acquainted , he has no certain proofs of the inefficacy or imperfection of the other .


But experience , sir , may be extended much farther than our own personal transactions , and may very justly comprehend those observations which we have had opportunities of making upon the conduct and success of others .
This gentleman , though he has only commanded in the armies of Britain , has seen the forces of other nations , has remarked their regulations , and heard of their actions with our confederates in the last war  he has probably acted in conjunction , and though it is known that they differ from us in the proportion of soldiers and officers , he has mentioned no disadvantage which might be supposed to arise from their establishment , and therefore , I suppose , he can not deny that their behaviour and success was the same with that of our own troops .


The battles of Almanza , Parma , and Guastalla , which he has particularly mentioned , were lost , as he informs us , by armies not officered according to the establishment which he recommends to us : but it is observable that his argument is defective in an essential part  for though he affirms that the armies which were defeated had fewer officers than the enemy , he has neither shown , nor attempted to show , that the want of officers occasioned the defeat , or that the loss would have been prevented by a greater number .


These instances , therefore , can be of no effect on the determination of the present question  for though it is certain that at Germany , and at other places , armies with few officers have lost the battle , it is not less common for those troops that are more liberally supplied , to be overthrown by others which are differently modelled .


With regard , sir , to the troops of Germany , I have heard them praised , in many parts of Europe , as not inferiour either to those of France , or of any other nation , and have been informed , that their ill success , both at Parma and Guastalla , may be justly imputed to other causes than the want of officers .


There has , perhaps , sir , seldom been an example of firmness , discipline , and resolution , beyond that which was shown by the Germans at the action of Parma , where they attacked the trenches of the French , sustained the fire of the ramparts of the city , and though they lost their commander-in-chief and two others , towards the beginning of the action , they continued the fight for eleven hours , and at last retired only at the approach of night .


At Guastalla , sir , they attacked the French in their trenches , even with forces inferiour in number , so far were they from any diffidence in the form of their establishment  and after a fight of seven hours , in which their loss was , under all their disadvantages , not greater than that of their enemies , they retreated to their former camp unmolested and unpursued .
The French , sir , were preserved in both these battles , not by the number of their officers , but by their situation , by woods , cassines , ditches , and intrenchments .


Nor do I discover , sir , what can be inferred from his observation of the influence of example in time of action , but that officers should be selected with great care , and not be promoted by favour , or interest , or caprice  for an example of cowardice in a leader must be pernicious , in proportion as that of bravery is beneficial  and as , where more officers are supposed necessary , there is less room for choice , it must be allowed that the troops , which have more officers than other forces , are in more danger of being infected with cowardice .


It appears , therefore , to me that the expense of the present establishment is a certain evil , and that the advantages are very doubtful : it appears that the present state of the nation requires frugality , and , therefore , I shall vote for the incorporation of our new levies with the old regiments .


By this incorporation , sir , our new-levied troops will be no longer distinguished from our veterans  they will be equally acquainted with discipline , and will learn , from the conversation of their associates , a spirit of enterprise , and a contempt of danger  we may then employ forces equally formidable in all parts of the publick service , and invade the dominions of our enemies , without leaving our own country desolate .


The arguments which the honourable gentleman has offered in defence of sending our younger troops to America , which may likewise be used against an incorporation , is , in my opinion , sir , far from being conclusive  for it supposes , what will not be granted , that a cold climate may be changed for a hotter with more safety by a young than an old man .
I have been told , on the contrary , that superabundant heat is the great disease of youth , and that the want of it produces most of the infirmities of age  and every one has known the lives of persons languishing with age , prolonged by a removal into warm countries .
I am , therefore , of opinion , that the honourable gentleman 's argument is defective in all its parts , and hope that I shall not be charged with obstinacy or perverseness for dissenting from him .


Mr. HOWE spoke next , in substance as follows : -- Sir , before I engage in a discussion of the question , I can not but think it necessary to observe , that the honourable gentleman who spoke the second in this debate , has been very far from consulting either policy or justice in his declamation , and that he deviated from the subject only to ridicule his country , to exalt our enemies , and depress our efforts .


He has described , sir , the British youth , the sons of noble families , and the hopes of the nation , in terms too contemptuous to be heard without indignation  he has amused himself with displaying their ignorance and their effeminacy , and has indulged his imagination in a malignant kind of gaiety , which , however it may divert himself , is very far from contributing either to the reformation or prevention of those practices which he censures .


I believe , sir , it will be granted , that nothing ought to please but in proportion to its propriety and truth  and , if we try the satire that we have lately heard , by this test , it will be found to have very little claim to applause  for our armies must be composed of the youth of the nation  and , for my part , I can not discover what advantage we shall gain over the Spaniards , by informing them how little our troops are accustomed to danger , how short a time they have been acquainted with fatigue , how tenderly they have been nursed , how easily they may be frighted , and how certainly they will be conquered , if they but meet with opposition .


Nor , sir , is such an account of the youth of Britain more true , in my opinion , than it is prudent .
I am far from discovering any such remarkable degeneracy in the age , or any great prevalence of cowardice and unmanly delicacy  nor do I doubt of hearing that our youth , if they are sent upon any expedition , have shown that the British courage is not yet extinguished , and that , if they are ranged on the plains of America , they will discover themselves the sons of those that forced those passes , and those trenches , that other troops would have failed in attempting .


That the degeneracy of the British youth , is , at least , not universal , we have just now sir , received an incontestable proof from the gentleman who spoke last , and spoke with so much elegance of language , and justness of reasoning , as shows , that there are to be found , among the youth of Britain , persons very well qualified for the senate  and I have never heard that a post in the army required greater abilities .


The pleasure , however , with which I have attended to his remarks , has not so far prejudiced me in favour of his opinion , as that I shall easily consent to change that method of discipline , to which our troops have been accustomed , and of which we know by experience , that it is , at least , not less efficacious than that of any other nation .
Customs , if they are not bad , are not to be changed , because it is an argument in favour of a practice that the people have experienced it , and approved it , and every change is disagreeable to those who judge only by prejudice , of whom I need not say how great is the number .


Many arguments may , sir , in my opinion , be added to our experience in favour of the present establishment .
The number of officers -- but I find myself unable to pursue my design , because I can no longer read my notes , which , being written by another hand , somewhat embarrass me in this decline of the light .
I shall , therefore , only make some observations upon the speech of the gentleman who spoke the second in this debate , and hope that I shall be allowed to deviate from the principal question , since I do it only in pursuit of another .


He has observed , that our troopers are mounted upon horses that are of no use  a remark , sir , which I never heard from any other person , and for which , I believe , no authority can be produced : they are mounted , indeed , upon horses very different from those which are used by other nations , because scarcely any other country breeds horses of equal size and strength , and , therefore , I am informed that the French have purchased horses from this island , and believe that all the cavalry of Europe would be mounted upon our horses if they could procure them .
I have been informed , that their pressure in the shock of battle is such , as no forces in the world are able to sustain  and that it was not less by the strength of our horses than the spirit of our soldiers , that the squadrons of France were , in the battle of Blenheim , pushed into the Danube .


Nor do I less disapprove his censure of the choice which has been made of the troops intended for the American service , which , though I ardently desire its success , I can not think of equal importance with the defence of our own country  for though we may be disgraced by a defeat , we can be endangered only by an invasion  and , therefore , I think it necessary to retain those troops on which we may best rely for the security of this island , lest our enemies should take the advantage of their absence , and set the pretender on the throne .


Sir William YONGE next rose , and spoke to the effect following : -- Sir , it is a standing maxim , both in private life and public transactions , that no man can obtain great advantages who is afraid of petty inconveniencies  and that he that will hope to obtain his end without expense , will languish for ever in fruitless wishes , and have the mortification of seeing the adventurous and the liberal enjoy that felicity , which , though it is within his reach , he is afraid of seizing .


When the depredations of the Spaniards became first the subject of our debates , nothing was heard amongst us but threats of vengeance , demands of reparation , assertions of sovereignty , and resolutions to obtain security : the importance of our commerce , the necessity of rigorous measures , the danger of pusillanimity , the meanness of negotiation , and the disadvantages of delay , were thundered from every part of the house .
Every man seemed to imagine that there was no mean between victory and ruin , and that not to humble Spain was to betray our country to insults , ignominy , and slavery .


Far was I then , sir , from suspecting , that when the war , thus vehemently urged , should be declared , that the prosecution of it would produce any debates .
I doubted not but that every man would be desirous of signalizing his zeal for the prosperity of commerce , by expediting the supplies , and forwarding the preparations  and that the only contention among us would be , who should appear the most ardent enemy of Spain .


But no sooner are hostilities begun against this insolent and oppressive nation , than those who expressed most resentment at the prudence and moderation by which they were delayed , those that accused every attempt for an accommodation , of cowardice , and charged the ministry with conniving at the rapine of pirates , begin to inquire into the necessity of the expenses occasioned by the war , to harangue on the advantages of parsimony , and to think it of more importance to ease our taxes than to subdue our enemies .


In pursuance of this new doctrine they are now endeavouring to embarrass the measures of his majesty , that they may save , according to their own computation , only thirty thousand pounds , which , in reality , I can easily show to be no more than fifteen thousand .


For the sake of this important sum , our army is to be modelled by a new regulation , and the success of the war is to be impeded , the security of our commerce to be hazarded , and our colonies are to be endangered .


Frugality is , undoubtedly , a virtue , but is , like others , to be practised on proper occasions : to compute expenses with a scrupulous nicety , in time of war , is to prefer money to safety , and , by a very perverse kind of policy , to hazard the whole for the preservation of a part .


The gentlemen , sir , who have most endeavoured to distinguish themselves as the constant opponents of the administration , have charged it , on all occasions , with giving encouragement to the Spaniards , but can charge it with nothing so likely to raise the confidence and confirm the obstinacy of the enemy , as the objections which they themselves have made to the present scheme of levying forces  for to how great a degree of poverty must they believe that nation reduced , of which the warmest patriots struggle to save a sum so inconsiderable , by an experiment of so much uncertainty ?
And how easily will the Spaniards promise themselves , that they shall gain the victory only by obliging us to continue in a state of war , a state which , by our own confession , we are not able to support ?


Had any other argument , sir , been produced than the necessity of parsimony , it had been less dangerous to have agreed to this new scheme  but to adopt it only for the sake of sparing fifteen thousand pounds , would be to make ourselves contemptible , to intimidate our allies , and to unite all those against us , who are inclined to trample on misery , and to plunder weakness .


I am inclined to judge so favourably , sir , of the intentions of those whom I am now opposing , that I believe they have only used this argument , because they were able to produce no other , and that if either reason or experience had been on their side , the poverty of the nation had not been mentioned .


But the honourable gentleman , who has been so long engaged in military employments , has shown that all our success has been obtained by the present establishment , and that the battle in which we suffered most , was lost by our unfortunate deficiency of officers .


Nor do his reasons , sir , however modestly offered , deserve less regard than his experience , for he has shown that a greater number of officers naturally contribute to preserve discipline , and excite courage  and it is not necessary that a man should be much a soldier to discover , that discipline and courage united , must generally prevail .
To the examples which he has produced in favour of his opinion , it has been objected , that victories equally wonderful have been gained with fewer officers , and , by the honourable gentleman that spoke the second on this occasion , the actions of Eugene were opposed to those of the duke of MARLBOROUGH .


That victories have been gained by troops differently regulated , I can not deny  victories have likewise been gained , sir , under every circumstance of disadvantage  victories have been gained by inferiour numbers , and by raw troops , over veteran armies , yet no prudent general ever produced these instances as arguments against the usefulness of discipline , or as proofs that superiority of numbers was no advantage .


The success of prince Eugene , in the late war , was far from convincing the British general , that the German establishment was preferable to our own  for he required that the Hessian troops , which were paid by Britain , should be officered like our national troops .
In this he could be influenced only by his own opinion  for he neither nominated their officers , nor could advance his interest at home by creating new posts to which he did not recommend  he could , therefore , only regard the success of the war , and changed their model only because he thought it defective .


The Germans themselves , sir , are far from imagining that their armies might not be made more formidable by approaching nearer to the British methods  for one of their officers , a man of great reputation and experience , has informed me , that they were convinced of their defect , and that nothing hindered them from adding more officers , but the fear of expenses  that they imputed all their defeats to the necessity of parsimony , that their men wanted not courage but leaders , and that their enemies gained advantages merely by the superiority of their opulence .


In the late war , it was common for the auxiliary troops , when they were sent upon any expedition of importance , to be supplied with officers either from their other regiments , or by the British forces  so necessary did the duke of MARLBOROUGH think a larger number of officers in time of action , that where he could not alter the establishment , he deviated from the common methods of war , and transferred his officers occasionally into troops over which they had no settled authority .


It is , therefore , most evident , sir , that the model on which our troops are formed , was , by this great commander , preferred to that which is now so warmly recommended , and I know not why we should recede from his practice , if we are desirous of his success .


Nor can I discover , sir , any better method of selecting officers than that which has of late been followed , however some may censure or ridicule it .
To advance gentlemen to command , seems to be the most likely way to unite authority with rank , for no man willingly obeys those to whom he has lately seen himself equal , or whose conduct in lower stations he has , perhaps , had opportunities of examining too nearly .


The distinction of birth , however chimerical in itself , has been so long admitted , and so universally received , that it is generally imagined to confer on one man an indelible and evident superiority over another , a superiority , which those who would easily imagine themselves equal in merit can not deny , and which they allow more willingly , because , though it be an advantage to possess it , to want it can not be justly considered as a reproach .


For this reason , sir , men cheerfully obey those to whom their birth seems to have subjected them , without any scrupulous inquiries into their virtue or abilities  they have been taught from their childhood to consider them as placed in a higher rank than themselves , and are , therefore , not disgusted at any transient bursts of impatience , or sudden starts of caprice , which would produce , at least , resentment , and , perhaps , mutiny , in men newly exalted from a low station .
The more attentively , sir , we look upon the world , the more strongly shall we be convinced of the truth of these assertions , and the more evidently shall we discover the influence which operates , in a degree scarcely credible , even to those who have experienced its power , and which is , indeed , one of the chief means of subordination , by which society is held together .


Nor are officers of birth , sir , to be preferred to men who are recommended by nothing but military service , only because they are more cheerfully obeyed , but for another reason of equal importance .
It has been observed , that , in reality , they discharge the duty of commanders in a manner more likely to preserve dignity and increase reverence  that they discover , on all occasions , a sense of honour , and dread of disgrace , which are not easily to be found in a mind contracted by a mean education , and depressed by long habits of subjection .


It is not , indeed , sir , universally and unvariably certain , that a man , raised from meanness and poverty , will be insolent and oppressive  nor do I doubt but there are many now languishing in obscurity , whose abilities might add new lustre to the highest honours , and whose integrity would very faithfully discharge the most important trust , and in their favour , wherever they can be discovered , some exceptions ought to be made  but as general rules are generally to be followed , as well in military regulations as other transactions , it will be found , upon the exactest inquiry , by no means improper to advance gentlemen to posts of command rather than private sentinels , however skilful or courageous .


It is to be considered , sir , that the present state of the continent , has for many years made it necessary to support an army , even when we are not engaged in an actual war  that this army , though of late it has , for the ease of the people , been sometimes encamped during the summer , is , for the greatest part , quartered in towns , and mingled with the rest of the community , but governed , at the same time , by the officers , and subject to the martial law .
It has often been observed by those who have argued against standing forces , that this difference of government makes different societies , which do not combine in the same interest , nor much favour one another  and it is , indeed , certain , that feuds are sometimes produced , that when any private quarrel happens , either by drunkenness or accident , or claims really disputable , between a soldier and any other , person , each applies for support and assistance to those in the same condition with himself , the cause becomes general , and the soldiers and townsmen are not easily restrained from blows and bloodshed .


It is true , likewise , that the rhetorick of the patriots has been so efficacious , that their arguments have been so clamorously echoed , and their weekly productions so diligently dispersed , that a great part of the nation , as men always willingly admit what will produce immediate ease or advantage , believes the army to be an useless burden imposed upon the people for the support of the ministry  that the landlord , therefore , looks upon the soldier as an intruder forced into his house , and rioting in sloth at his expense  and the farmer and manufacturer have learned to call the army the vermin of the land , the caterpillars of the nation , the devourers of other men 's industry , the enemies of liberty , and the slaves of the court .


It is not to be supposed , sir , that the soldiers entertain the same ideas of their profession , or that they do not conceive themselves injured by such representations : they undoubtedly consider themselves as the bulwark of their country , as men selected for the defence of the rest of the community , as those who have engaged , at the hazard of their lives , to repel invasion , and repress rebellion , and who contribute more than their part to the general felicity , by securing property , and preventing danger .


It is not to be doubted , sir , but sentiments so widely different , must produce an equal contrariety of claims , and diversity of conduct : the trader imagines , that the man who subsists upon the taxes which are raised only from his labour , ought to consider himself as his inferiour , at least , if not as his hireling and his servant  the soldier wonders how he can ever conceive himself sufficiently grateful to him that has devoted his life to his defence , and to whom he must fly for protection whenever danger shall approach him , and concludes , that he has an incontestable right to the better part of that , of which the preservation of the whole depends upon him .


Thus does self-love magnify every man in his own eyes , and so differently will men determine when each is to judge in his own cause .
Which of these competitors thinks most justly of his own station and character , or whether both are not mistaken in their opinion , I think it by no means necessary to decide .
This , at least , is evident , that to preserve peace and harmony between two bodies of men obliged to live together with sentiments so opposite , there is required an uncommon degree of prudence , moderation , and knowledge of mankind , which is chiefly to be exerted on the part of the soldiers , because they are subject to more rigorous command , and are more easily governed by the authority of their superiours .


Let us suppose any dispute of this kind , sir , to happen where the soldiers were commanded only by private sentinels , disguised in the dress of officers , but retaining , what it can not be expected that they should suddenly be able to lay aside , the prejudices which they had imbibed in the ranks , and all the ardour of trifling competition in which their station had once engaged them .
What could be expected from their councils and direction ?
Can it be imagined that they would inquire impartially into the original cause of the dispute , that they would attend equally to the parties , endeavour , by mildness and candour , to soften the malevolence of each , and terminate the dispute by some addressful expedient , or decent accommodation ?
He , surely , must be very little acquainted with the vulgar notions of bravery and honour , that could form any hopes of such conduct .


The plain soldier , sir , has not accustomed himself to regulate his motions by reason , nor has learned any more of honour , than that it consists in adhering invariably to his pretensions , even though he should discover that they are false  and in resenting affronts with the utmost rigour , even when they were provoked by himself , he is taught , that it is his business to conquer in whatever cause , and that to desist from any of his attempts , or retract any of his assertions , is unworthy of a man of honour .


Warm with such notions as these , sir , would such officers , as have been recommended by the honourable gentleman , apply themselves to the termination of differences ?
Without any knowledge of the laws of society , without any settled ideas of the different rights of different persons , they would have nothing in view but the honour of their profession , nor endeavour to support it by any other method than that of violence .
If a soldier was affronted by a farmer , they would probably lay his territories waste , and ravage his plantations like an enemy 's country  if another disagreed with his landlord , they would advise him to make good his quarters , to invade the magazines of provision without restraint , to force the barricadoes of the cellar , and to forage in the stables without controul .


But gentlemen , sir , are proper judges of debates between the army and the rest of the community , because they are equally related to both parties , as men who possess or expect estates , or who are allied to those whose influence arises from their property .
As men bred in affluence and freedom , and acquainted with the blessings of our constitution , and the necessity of civil government , they can not willingly contribute to the increase of the military power , and as members of the army they can not but be desirous to support their own rank , and to hinder their profession from sinking into contempt  it is , therefore , their care to repress insolence on one part , and to prevent oppression on the other , to stop dissensions in their beginning , and reconcile all the different pretensions of Britons and soldiers .


I am , indeed , surprised , sir , to hear the promotion of serjeants recommended by the honourable gentleman who has so often strained his lungs , and exhausted his invention , to explain how much our constitution is endangered by the army , how readily those men will concur in the abolition of property who have nothing to lose , and how easily they may be persuaded to destroy the liberties of their country , who are already cut off from the enjoyment of them , who , therefore , can only behold with envy and malevolence those advantages which they can not hope to possess , and which produce in them no other effects than a quicker sense of their own misery .


Upon what principles , sir , any gentleman can form those notions , or with what view he can so long and so studiously disperse them , it is his province to explain  for the only reason that can be offered by any other person for his incessant declamations , the desire of securing his country from the oppression of a standing army , is now for ever overthrown by this new proposal  which , if it were to be received , would in a very few years produce an army proper to be employed in the execution of the most detestable designs , an army that could be of no other use than to gratify an ambitious prince , or a wicked ministry , as it would be commanded , not by men who had lost their liberty , but by men who never enjoyed it , by men who would abolish our constitution without knowing that they were engaged in any criminal undertaking , who have no other sense of the enjoyment of authority than that it is the power of acting without controul , who have no knowledge of any other laws than the commands of their superiours .


To men like these , sir , to men raised up from poverty and servility to rank and power , to ignorance invested with command , and to meanness elated with preferment , would any real patriot , any zealous assertor of liberty , any inflexible enemy to the corruptions of the ministry , consign the protection of his country , and intrust to these our happiness , properties , and our lives ?


Whether the honourable gentleman has changed any of the sentiments which he has hitherto appeared to admit with regard to the army , whether this new determination is only an instance of that inconsistency which is scarcely to be avoided in the vindication of a bad cause , or whether he was betrayed to it only by his hatred of the administration , which would prompt him to recant his own advice , if it should happen to be approved , I will not pretend to determine , but I must lament , on this occasion , the entertainment which the house will lose , by the eternal cessation of any harangues on the army , since he can not now declaim on either part without contradicting his former declarations .


Nor will the honourable gentleman find less difficulty in proving , that justice , rather than policy , requires the promotion of Serjeants to commissions .
Military preferments are always at the disposal of the crown , nor can any right be pretended to them , but such as arises from the custom which has been generally followed in conferring them , which is not only variable at pleasure , but has never been , at any time , regularly observed .
The order of rotation has been suffered sometimes to proceed , because of two persons , otherwise equal , he that has served longest may plead the most merit  but the plea of service has been always overruled by birth or powerful recommendation .
And though , sir , it is natural for men disappointed to complain , yet as those officers , whose preferment has been delayed , were not thought , in reality , to have received any injury , their murmurs have been the less regarded .


It might be expected , sir , from a patriot , a lamenter of the degeneracy of mankind , and an inflexible opponent of corruption , that he should consider rather facts than persons , that he should regulate his decision by the unvariable principles of reason and justice , and that , therefore , he should not applaud at one time what he condemns at another .


But this gentleman seems to have established some new maxims of conduct , and , perhaps , upon new notions of morality  for he seems to imagine , that his friends may seize , as their right , what his adversaries can not touch without robbery , though the claim of both be the same .


It is well known , sir , to the whole army , that a noble person , whose abilities are so loudly celebrated , whose virtues are so liberally praised , and whose removal from his military employments is so solemnly lamented as a publick calamity , obtained his first preferments by pretensions very different from military merit , and that at the age only of seventeen , a time of life in which , whatever might be his abilities , very little prudence or experience could be expected , he was advanced to the command of a regiment , and exalted above many officers whose known bravery and frequent hazards entitled them to favour .


I do not assert that he was undeservedly promoted , or condemn those who either solicited or granted his commission  I maintain only , that what was then reasonable and just , is not now either iniquitous or ridiculous , and different persons in the same circumstances have a right to the same treatment .


In the reign of queen Anne , a reign , sir , which every Briton recollects with so much satisfaction , and which will for ever afford examples of the wisest councils , and most successful wars , when new regiments were to be raised , it was far from being thought necessary to observe this gentleman 's favourite method of rotation  posts were filled , not with the officers of other regiments , that room might be left for the promotion of serjeants , but with gentlemen who had never seen a battle , or learned any part of the military discipline .


But though , sir , the regulation of our army be thus violently attacked , the greatest crime of the ministry is , in this gentleman 's opinion , that of levying new troops , when we have no employment for our standing forces , of laying unnecessary impositions upon the nation , and alarming with the fears of an invasion , only that the army might be increased .


On this head , sir , a declaration of the duke of MARLBOROUGH has been produced , with a great pomp of circumstances , and such a seeming accuracy of narration , that the attention of the house was engaged , and the account was received with all the solemnity of universal silence , and with the veneration due to so high an authority in a question of so much importance .


The subject is , indeed , so worthy of regard , that I think , sir , every man ought to contribute to its elucidation , and , therefore , I take the liberty of adding to the honourable gentleman 's relation , what I hope will be heard with equal curiosity , the method by which that great commander proposed to put a stop to an invasion with so small a number .


He was very far , sir , from imagining that he should be able to repel them by open force , he was far from being so confident of his superiority in military skill , as to imagine that he should defeat them by stratagem , and , therefore , he designed , by burning the villages , and destroying the country , to deprive them of the means of subsistence , and harass them with famine  to hover at a distance , and cut off those parties which necessity should force out to forage , till a body of troops could be assembled sufficient to overthrow them in a battle , or to drive them back to their ships .


Such was the scheme , sir , as I have been informed , of this great man , nor , perhaps , can any other be struck out by human abilities , where greater numbers are to be opposed by smaller .
But this scheme , though preferable , in the last extremities , to slavery , is such as can not be mentioned without horrour , and of which the execution ought to be avoided by every expedient that can be practised without the danger of our liberties .
We ought , certainly , not to reject a nauseous medicine , by which that health is preserved , which , if lost , can only be restored by the amputation of a limb .


As it was , therefore , necessary , sir , to secure our coasts from an invasion , it was necessary to raise new troops for the American expedition  nor did this method produce any delay , for the regiments were completed a long time before the ships of war and the transports were ready to convoy and receive them , nor could the utmost ardour and diligence despatch them sooner from our coasts .


The ships , sir , were , by the violence of a frost , scarcely exampled , retained , for a long time , in the harbours , without a possibility of being put to sea  when they were all assembled at the place appointed for their conjunction , they waited for a wind  all the delay that can be objected , was produced by the seasons , of which the regulation was in no man 's power .


But the time , sir , which was unwillingly spent in the camp , was not , however , lost or misemployed , for the troops were , by the order of the general , every day exercised , and instructed in the art of war , so that what was lost in time , was more than recompensed by the advantage of better discipline .


Nor did these troops appear an herd so ignorant and contemptible , as they have been represented by malicious invectives and ludicrous descriptions  there were not , indeed , among them many grey-headed warriours , nor were their former campaigns and past exploits the subjects of their conversation  but there was not one amongst them who did not appear ready to suffer , in the cause of his country , all that the most hardened veteran could undergo , or whose alacrity and eagerness did not promise perseverance in the march , and intrepidity in the battle .


Their general , sir , who saw them pursue their exercises , declared how much he was satisfied with their proficiency , applauded their appearance , and expressed his confidence in their courage  nor do I doubt , but our enemies will find , that it is not necessary to send out our most formidable forces to humble them , and that the youth of Britain will compensate their want of experience by their courage .


If I , sir , have been drawn aside from the present question , it is by following , perhaps , with an exactness too scrupulous , the honourable gentleman , whose propositions I have now shown to be erroneous , and whose reproaches will , I believe , now appear rather the effects of disappointment than of zeal , and , therefore , I think it now necessary to return to the business before us , the consideration of the present establishment , from which , as it was approved by the duke of MARLBOROUGH , and has been defended with very strong arguments , by one of the most experienced officers of this time , I can not think it safe or prudent to depart .


Mr. GRENVILLE spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , as a noble person has been frequently hinted at in this debate , to whom my relation is well known , and whom , as I know him well , I have the strongest motives to reverence and honour , I can not forbear to give , on this occasion , an attestation which he will be allowed to deserve by all those whom interest has not blinded , and corruption depraved .


It will be allowed , sir , that he is one of those who are indebted for their honours only to merit , one whom the malice of a court can not debase , as its favour can not exalt  he is one of those whose loss of employments can be a reproach only to those who take them from him , as he can not forfeit them but by performing his duty , and can only give offence by steady integrity , and a resolution to speak as he thinks , and to act as his conscience dictates .


There are , sir , men , I know , to whom this panegyrick will seem romantick and chimerical , men , to whom integrity and conscience are idle sounds , men , who are content to catch the word of their leader , who have no sense of the obligation of any law but the supreme will of him that pays them , and who know not any virtue but diligence in attendance , and readiness in obedience .


It is surely , sir , no loss to the noble person to be debarred from any fellowship with men like these .
Nothing can be more unpleasing to virtue than such a situation as lays it under a necessity of beholding wickedness that can not be reformed  as the sight of a pesthouse must raise horrour , though we should suppose the spectator secure from the contagion .


Mr. ORD spoke next , in substance as follows : -- Sir , as I can not approve the scheme now proposed , for augmenting our forces , I shall endeavour to show why the arguments , by which it has hitherto been supported , have failed to convince me , and shall lay before the house some reasons against it , to which I shall expect an answer , before I shall think that I can agree to it , without squandering the money of which my constituents have intrusted me with the disposal .


The argument , sir , with which this motion was introduced , which is , indeed , the strongest that has yet been offered , was , that this estimate is less expensive than one that was laid before the house in a late reign , and that , therefore , it could not reasonably be charged with extravagance .


Let us now consider this argument with that care which is required by the importance of the question , let us inquire what consequences will follow from it , and to what previous suppositions it must owe its force .


The argument , sir , evidently supposes that the estimate in king William 's reign was drawn up without any intention to deceive the house , or to raise money for purposes different from those for which it was really expended .
But if we suppose that estimate to be fraudulently calculated , this may contain the same fallacies in a lower degree , and the only merit that can be claimed by the authors of it , will be , that they are not the most rapacious plunderers of their country , that , however they may be charged with profusion of publick money , they are yet more modest than some of their predecessors .


But it is known , sir , that in king William 's reign , very few estimates were honestly computed  it is known that the rotation of parties , and fluctuation of measures , reduced the ministry to subsist upon artifices , to amuse the senate with exorbitant demands , only that they might obtain the necessary grants , and to pretend expenses which never were incurred , that the supplies which the publick affairs really required , might not be withheld  as fraudulent tradesmen fix immoderate prices , that the buyer may make offers proportionate to their demands .


The estimates , therefore , of that reign are of very little authority , though they might sometimes pass the house without censure  for it is to be considered , that by the frequency of new elections , the greatest part of the members were often unacquainted with the state of publick accounts , and that an army was so little known to this kingdom , that the true expense of it might easily be concealed .


Nor is this , sir , the only fallacy of this argument  for it supposes , likewise , that the nation is no less wealthy than in the time when that computation was offered , with which this is so triumphantly compared .
For every man knows that publick as well as private expenses are to be proportioned to the revenue by which they are supplied , and that the charges which are easily supported at one time , may threaten ruin at another .


But unhappily , sir , it is evident , that , since the days of that sovereign , the nation has been exhausted by a long and wasteful war , and since , by a peace equally destructive , it is embarrassed with an enormous debt , and entangled in treaties , of which the support may call every day for new expenses  it has suffered since that time a thousand losses , but gained no advantage , and yet the expenses of that time are mentioned as an example to be compared with those which are proposed in this .


The difference of the condition of the British nation at those two periods of time , sir , is not less than that of the strength of the same man in the vigour of youth and the frigidity of old age , in the flush of health and the languor of disease , of the same man newly risen from rest and plenty , and debilitated with hunger and fatigue .


To make such a comparison , sir , betrays , at least , a very criminal insensibility , of the publick misery , if it may not be charged with greater malignity .
I know not whether those who shall hear of this debate , may not impute such reflections rather to cruelty than negligence , and imagine that those who squander the treasure of the nation take pleasure in reproaching that poverty which their counsels produce , and indulge their own vanity by contemplating the calamities from which they are themselves secure , and to which they are indebted for opportunities of increasing their own fortunes , and gratifying their ambition .
It is evident , that an estimate which requires less than that which has been mentioned , may yet exact more than the nation can now raise , without feeling too great inconveniencies to be compensated by the advantages which can be expected from our new forces .
Nor is it sufficient that it is lower than those of former times  for , as it ought to be the care of the government to preserve the ease and happiness of the people , it should be reduced in proportion to the diminution of the national wealth .


The right honourable gentleman confesses , sir , that frugality is a virtue , and his argument supposes that to contract expenses is an argument of prudent measures  why then is he afraid of carrying virtue to a greater height , of making the burden still more light , and preferring the cheapest estimate that can be proposed , when it is asserted by those whose authority is most worthy of regard , that it will produce no weakness in our troops , nor give our enemies any superiority ?


I do not pretend any other skill in military affairs , than may be gained by casual conversation with soldiers , and by a cursory observation of daily occurrences  but I speak with greater confidence on this occasion , because I do not think any other qualifications necessary for the determination of this question , than a habit of just reasoning , and freedom from the prejudices of interest .


Every man knows , sir , without a military education , that it is imprudent to purchase any thing at a greater price which may be procured at a less , and that when the same sum will buy two things , of which one is evidently preferable to the other , the best ought to be chosen .


If the application of either of these two positions will decide this controversy , there will be no need of recurring to experience , of citing the authority of foreign commanders , of comparing the actions of the German and British generals , or of inquiring how battles have been lost , or to what victories are to be ascribed .


It is evident , sir , that the scheme now proposed , is twice as costly as that which is recommended in opposition to it , and therefore , unless it will produce twice the advantage , it must be acknowledged to be imprudently chosen .
The advantage in war , is to be rated by comparing the strength of different numbers in different circumstances , and inquiring what degree of superiority will be found .


If we suppose , sir , two bodies of men , equally armed and disciplined , opposed to each other without any advantage of situation , we must conceive that neither party could be conquered , that the balance of the day must remain equal , and that the contest would continue undecided .


It can not be objected to this supposition , sir , that no such event is recorded in history , because in war many causes really act which can not be estimated  one army may consist of soldiers more courageous , and more confident in the justice of their cause  unforeseen accidents may operate , orders may be mistaken , or leaders may be misinformed  but all these considerations are to be set aside in speculation , because they may equally be alleged on either part .


Two bodies of men , sir , equally numerous , being , therefore , supposed equal , it is to be inquired how either may be superiour to the other .
It is proposed , on one part , to produce this effect by doubling the number of officers rather than increasing that of the soldiers  on the other , to double the soldiers under the same officers , the expense being the same of both methods .


When two armies , modelled according to these different schemes , enter the field , what event can be expected ?
Either five thousand men , with a double number of officers , must be equal to ten thousand , differently regulated , or the publick has paid more for assistance of the officers than its real value , and has chosen , of two methods equally expensive , that which is least efficacious .


This , sir , is the state of the question now before us  our present deficiency is not of men but money , and we may procure ten thousand men regulated like the foreign troops , at the same expense as five thousand in the form proposed  but I am afraid that no man will be found to assert , that the addition of officers will be equivalent to a double number of soldiers .


Thus it is evident , sir , evident to demonstration , that the most expensive method is , at the same time , the least advantageous , and that the proposal of new regiments is intended to augment the strength of the ministry rather than of the army .


If we suppose , sir , what is more than any foreigner will grant , that the additional officers raise a body of five thousand men to an equality with six thousand , is not the pay of four thousand men apparently thrown away ?
And do not the officers receive a reward which their service can not deserve ?
Would it not be far more rational to raise seven thousand , by which our army would be stronger by a seventh part , and as the pay of three thousand would be saved , the publick would be richer by almost a third .


Surely , sir , numerical arguments can not but deserve some consideration , even from those who have learned by long practice to explain away mere probability at pleasure , to select the circumstances of complicated questions , and only to show those which may be produced in favour of their own opinions .


In the present question , sir , there is very little room for fallacy  nor do I see what remains to the decision of it , but that those gentlemen who have been acquainted with military operations , inform us , what degree of superiority is conferred by any assignable number of officers  that we may compare their service with the price , and discover whether the same money will not purchase greater advantages .


The experience of the late war may evince , sir , that those troops which have the greatest number of officers are not always victorious  for our establishment never admitted the same , or nearly the same number with that of the French , our enemies  nevertheless , we still boast of our victories  nor is it certain that we might not have been equally successful , though the number of our officers had been yet less .


Foreigners , sir , are very far from discovering the defect of their own establishment , or imagining that they should become more formidable by imitating our methods .
When I travelled , I took opportunities of conversing with the generals of those nations which are most famous for the valour of their troops , and was informed by them , that they thought a multitude of officers by no means useful , and that they were so far from desiring to see their own regulation changed , that they should make no scruple of recommending it to other nations , who , in their opinion , squandered their treasure upon useless commissions , and increased the calamities of war by unnecessary burdens .


I hope no man will think it sufficient to reply to these arguments with general assertions , or will deny the necessity of frugality , and extol the opulence of the nation , the extent of our commerce , and the happiness of our condition .
Such indeed , sir , is the method of argumentation made use of by the hireling scribblers of the court , who , because they feel none of the publick calamities , represent all complaints as criminal murmurs , and charge those with sedition who petition only for relief .
Wretches like these would celebrate our victories , though our country should be overrun by an invader , would praise the lenity of any government by which themselves should be spared , and would boast of the happiness of plenty , when half the people should be languishing with famine .


I do not suppose , sir , that the despicable sophistry of prostitutes like these has any effect here , nor should I have thought them worthy of the least notice , had it not been proper to inquire , whether those may not be justly suspected of some inclination to deceive , even in this assembly , by whom the most profligate of mankind are openly paid for the promulgation of falsehood , and the patronage of corruption .


It is indeed , sir , artful , in those who are daily impairing our honour and influence , to endeavour to conceal from the people their own weakness , that weakness which is so well known in foreign countries , that every nation is encouraged to insult us , and by which it may reasonably be imagined that new enemies will , in a short time , be raised .


The late changes in our military regulations have , indeed , taken away all the terrour of our arms  those troops are now no longer dreaded , by which the liberties of Europe were recovered , and the French reduced to abandon their schemes of universal empire , for the defence of their own country , because the officers by whom they were formerly conducted to glory and to victory , are now dismissed , and men advanced to their posts , who are neither feared nor known .


When the duke of ARGYLE was lately deprived of his command , the Spaniards could not conceal their satisfaction  they bestowed , however unwillingly , the highest panegyrick upon his bravery and conduct , by showing that he was the only Briton of whom they were afraid .
Nor did their allies , the French , discover less exultation  for by them it was declared , that the nation was now disarmed , that either no war was intended , or that none could be successfully prosecuted , since , as they made no scruple to assert , though I know not whether I ought to repeat it , we have no other man capable of commanding armies , or conducting any great design .


I am informed that this illustrious warriour , whose abilities are sufficiently attested by these enemies , that have felt their prevalence , is of opinion , that the number of officers now required is not necessary , and has declared that he should with equal confidence undertake either invasion or defence , with forces modelled after the German custom  and since I have shown , that , unless the troops so regulated , are equivalent to a double number , added to the standing regiments , part of the expense of the officers is evidently squandered , I shall vote against the motion , unless it be proved , which I believe will not be attempted , that the force of a regiment is doubled by doubling the officers .


General WADE then spoke , to the purpose following : -- Sir , the learned gentleman who spoke last , must be acknowledged to have discovered a very specious method of reasoning , and to have carried his inquiry as far as speculation without experience can hope to proceed , but has , in my opinion , admitted a false principle , by which all his argument has been perplexed .


He supposes , that the advantages must be always in proportion to the money expended in procuring them , and that , therefore , if five thousand men , raised at any given cost , will be equal to five thousand , they ought , if they are regulated according to an establishment of double the charge , to be able to encounter ten thousand .


But in this supposition , sir , he forgets that the possibility of loss is to be thrown into the balance against the advantage of the expense saved , and that though the strength of the troops be not increased in proportion to the increase of the cost , yet the additional security against a great loss may justly entitle the most expensive regulation to the preference .


Suppose five thousand men to be brought into the field against six thousand  if they can , by multiplying their officers at a double expense , be enabled to engage successfully a body superiour in number by only a sixth part , the nation may be justly said to gain all that would have been lost by suffering a defeat .


That we ought not to choose a worse method when we can discover a better , is indisputably true , but which method is worse or better , can be discovered only by experience .
The last war has taught us , that our troops in their present establishment are superiour to the forces of France , but how much they might suffer by any alteration it is not possible to foresee .


Success is gained by courage , and courage is produced by an opinion of superiority  and it may easily be imagined , that our soldiers , who judge of their own strength only by experience , imagine their own establishment and discipline advanced to the highest perfection  nor would they expect any other consequences from an alteration of it , but weakness and defeats .
It is , therefore , dangerous to change the model of our forces , because it is dangerous to depress the spirit of our soldiers .


Though it is confessed , sir , that the French , whose officers are still more numerous , have been conquered by our troops , it must be likewise alleged , that they had yielded us far easier victories had their officers been wanting  for to them are they indebted for their conquests wherever they have been successful , and for their resistance wherever they have been with difficulty defeated  their soldiers are a spiritless herd , and were they not invigorated by the example of their leaders , and restrained by the fear of instant punishment , would fly at the approach of any enemy , without waiting for the attack .


I can not , therefore , sir , but be of opinion , that the necessity of a large number of officers , may be learned even from the behaviour of those troops which have been unsuccessful , since it is certain , that though they have been often overcome , they have generally resisted with great steadiness , and retired with great order .


If those , who are only speculative warriours , shall imagine that their arguments are not confuted , I can only repeat what I declared when I first attempted to deliver my sentiments in this debate , that I do not pretend to be very skilful in the arts of disputation .
I , who claim no other title than that of an old soldier , can not hope to prevail much by my oratory  it is enough for me that I am confident of confuting those arguments in the field , which I oppose in the senate .


Mr. FOX spoke next , in this manner : -- Sir , I am far from thinking that this question has been hitherto fully explained by those who have either considered it only as a dispute about money , or a question merely speculative concerning the proportions between different degrees of expense , and probability of success .
In a war of this kind , expense is the last and lowest consideration , and where experience may be consulted , the conjectures of speculation ought to have no weight .


The method , sir , by which our troops have hitherto been regulated , is well known to have produced success beyond our expectations , to have exalted us to the arbitration of the world , to have reduced the French to change their threats of forcing a monarch upon us , into petitions for peace , and to have established the liberties of almost every nation of the world that can call itself free .


Whether this method , sir , so successful , so easy , and so formidable , shall be changed , whether it shall be changed at a time when the whole continent is in commotion , and every nation calling soldiers to its standard  when the French , recovered from their defeats , seem to have forgotten the force of that hand that crushed them in the pride of victory  when they seem to be reviving their former designs , and rekindling their extinguished ambition  whether , at such a time , the regulations of our army shall be changed to save , upon the highest computation , only thirty thousand pounds , is the present question .


On such a question , sir , I can not observe , without astonishment , any man deliberating for a single moment .
To suspend our opinion in this case , would be to balance our lives , our liberties , our patrimonies , and our posterity , against thirty thousand pounds .


The effects of our present method , sir , are well known to ourselves , our confederates , our enemies , to every man that has heard the name of Blenheim and Ramillies  the consequences of the establishment , now contended for , our most experienced commanders own themselves unable to foresee , and I am far from believing that theoretical disquisitions can enable any man to make great discoveries in military affairs .


Our own inexperience of the method which is so warmly recommended , is not the strongest objection to it , though even this ought , in my opinion , to restrain us from trying it at this hazardous conjuncture .
But since arguments , merely negative , may be thought over-balanced by the prospect of saving money , I shall lay before the house , what effects the want of officers has produced , with regard to those nations whose poverty has laid them under a necessity of parsimonious establishments .


When the Germans were defeated by the French , in the late war , I was at the Sardinian court , where the battle was , as it may easily be supposed , the reigning subject of conversation , and where they did not want opportunities of informing themselves minutely of all the circumstances which contributed to the event  it was there , sir , universally determined , that the Germans lost the day merely for want of officers .


It was observed also , sir , that some troops , which were once courted and feared by all the neighbouring potentates , had lost their reputation in later times , of which no reason could be alleged , but that they had lessened the number of their officers  such is the change in the model of the Walloons , and such is the consequence produced by it .


I am very far , sir , from thinking , that reason is not to be consulted in military operations , as in other affairs , and have no less satisfaction than the learned gentleman who spoke last but one , in clear and demonstrative deductions  but in this question , reason itself informs me , that regard ought only to be had to experience , and that authority unsupported by practice , ought to have no prevalence .


I shall , therefore , sir , make no inquiry into the abilities of the generals , by whom these contrary opinions are defended , nor draw any parallel between their actions or their knowledge .
It is sufficient for me that the one is proposing a new scheme , and that the opinion of the other can plead the practice of king William , and the duke of MARLBOROUGH , and the success of the last war .


Yet , sir , if parsimony be a virtue at this time so eminently necessary , it may be urged in favour of this estimate , that it will be less expensive than those that have been formerly offered , and that as all changes ought to be gradual , this may be considered as the first step towards a general reduction of the publick charge .


Mr. HEATHCOTE spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , it is not without astonishment , that I heard the honourable gentleman who spoke lately , conclude his remarks with an attempt to renew our apprehensions of the pretender , a chimerical invader , an enemy in the clouds , without spirit , and without forces , without dominions , without money , and without allies  a miserable fugitive , that has not a friend in this kingdom , or none but such as are exasperated by those whom the men that mention him with so much terrour are attempting to vindicate .


The vanity , sir , of such fears , the folly of admitting them , if they are real , and of counterfeiting them , if they are false , has been sufficiently exposed in this debate , by my honourable friend  but as he thought it unnecessary to employ arguments in proof of what can not be denied , and believed it sufficient to ridicule a panick which he supposed merely political , I , who judge , perhaps , more favourably of the sincerity of some , and more tenderly of the cowardice of others , shall endeavour to show , that the frequent revolutions which have happened in this nation , afford us no reason for fearing another , equally sudden and unforeseen in favour of the pretender .


The government , sir , is always stronger , as it is complicated with the private interest of more individuals  because , though there are few that have comprehension sufficient to discern the general advantage of the community , almost every man is capable of attending to his own  and though not many have virtue to stand up in opposition to the approach of general calamities , of which every one may hope to exempt himself from his particular share , yet the most sanguine are alarmed , and the most indolent awakened at any danger which threatens themselves , and will exert their utmost power to obviate or escape it .


For this reason , sir , I have long considered the publick funds established in this nation , as a barrier to the government , which can not easily be broken : a foreign prince can not now be placed upon the throne , but in opposition almost to every wealthy man , who , having trusted the government with his money , has reposited a pledge of his own fidelity .


But to this gentleman , sir , whom I am now answering , arguments can be of very little importance , because , by his own confession , he is retained as a mere machine , to speak at the direction of another , and to utter sentiments which he never conceived , and which his hesitation and abrupt conclusion shows him to admit with very little examination .
He had not even allowed himself time to know the opinion which he was to assert , or to imprint upon his memory those arguments to which he was to add the sanction of his authority .
He seems to have boldly promised to speak , and then to have inquired what he was to say .
Yet has this gentleman often declaimed here with all the apparent ardour of integrity , and been heard with that regard which is only due to virtue and independence .


Some of his assertions are such , however , as require confutation , which is , perhaps , more necessary since he has produced an authority for them , which many of those who heard him may think of much greater weight than his own .
He affirms , that we can suffer only by an invasion , and infers from this position , that we need only to guard our own coasts .
I am of an opinion very different , and having not yet prevailed upon myself to receive notes from any other person , can not forbear to speak what I think , and what the publick prosperity requires to be generally known .
We may surely suffer by many other causes , by the ignorance , or treachery , or cowardice of the ministry , by the negligence of that person to whom this gentleman was probably indebted for his notes .
We may suffer by the loss of our sugar colonies , which may be justly valued at ten millions .


These plantations , which afford us almost all the profitable trade that is now left us , have been exposed to the insults of the enemy , without any other guard than two ships , almost unfit for service .
They have been left to the protection of chance , with no other security , at a time when the Spaniards had fitted out a squadron , to infest and ravage our American dominions .


The admiral , who was sent into America , was confined for almost a year in the ports , without forces , ships , or ammunition , which yet might have been sent in a few months , had not pretences of delay been studiously invented , had not the preparations been obstructed by clandestine expedients , and had not every man been tacitly assured , that he should recommend himself to his superiours , by raising difficulties , rather than by removing them .


Such was the conduct of those who now stand up in the face of their country , and , without diffidence or shame , boast of their zeal , their assiduity , and their despatch  who proclaim , with an air of triumphant innocence , that no art or diligence could have been more expeditious , and that the embarkation was only impeded by the seasons and the winds .


With assertions equally intrepid , and arguments equally contemptible , has the same person , who boasted his expedition , endeavoured to defend the establishment of new regiments , in opposition to the practice of foreign nations , and to the opinion of the greatest general among us  and , to show how little he fears confutation , has recommended his scheme on account of its frugality .


It is not to be wondered , sir , that such an orator should undertake to defend the model of the troops sent to America , that he should prefer boys to veterans , and assert the propriety of intrusting new levies to unexperienced commanders  for he has given us in this debate such proofs of controversial courage , that nothing can be now imagined too arduous for him to attempt .


His strength , sir , is , indeed , not equal to his spirit , and he is frequently unsuccessful in his most vigorous efforts , but it must be confessed that he is generally overborne only by the force of truth , by a power which few can resist so resolutely as himself , and which , therefore , though it makes no impression upon him , prevails upon others to leave him sometimes alone in the vindication of his positions .


The examples , sir , of those noble persons who were advanced early to commissions , will be produced by him without effect , because the cases are by no means parallel .
They were not invested with command till they had spent some time in the service , and exhibited proofs of their courage and their capacity  and it can not be doubted , but some men may discover at seventeen , more merit than others in the full strength of manhood .


But , sir , there is another consideration of more importance , which will annihilate the parallel , and destroy the argument founded upon it .
At the time in which these persons were preferred , the nation had but newly seen an army , and had , therefore , very few old officers whose experience could be trusted , or whose services required to be rewarded : the ministers were obliged to select those , who , though they did not understand the military sciences , were likely to attain them in a short time , and the event has sufficiently proved , that in the choice no greater regard was paid to interest than to judgment .


It was prudent , likewise , sir , to choose young persons , supposing their abilities equal with those of others , because the nation was likely to possess them longer , and would not be reduced , by an interval of peace , to make war again with raw forces , under the direction of ignorant commanders .


But this provision , however reasonable , the wisdom of this ministry has found means to defeat , by detaining at home the disciplined troops , and depriving the most experienced generals of their commands , at a time when they are most necessary , at a time when the whole world is in arms , when the ambition of France is reviving its claims , and the Spaniards are preparing to invade our colonies .


But , sir , though our generals are discarded , we are sufficiently informed , that it is not because we are imagined to be in a state of safety  for the increase of our army betrays our fear , of which , whether it will be dispelled or increased by such measures , it is not difficult to determine .


An army thus numerous , sir , is , in the opinion of every honest Briton , of every man that reveres the constitution , or loves his liberty , an evil more to be dreaded , than any from which we can be defended by it .
The most unpopular act of the most unpopular of our monarchs , was the establishment of a standing-army  nor do I know any thing to be feared from the exaltation of the dreadful pretender to the throne , but that he will govern the nation with an armed force .


If our troops continue to be increased , which we may reasonably suspect , since , if arguments like these be admitted , pretences for augmentations can never be wanting , the consequences are easily foreseen  they will grow too numerous to be quartered in the towns , and , with an affectation of easing them of such unwelcome guests , it will be proposed , that after having spent the summer in a camp , they shall retire in winter to barracks .
Then will the burden of a standing army be imposed for ever on the nation  then may our liberties be openly invaded , and those who now oppress us by the power only of money , will then throw aside the mask , and deliver themselves from the constraint of hypocrisy  those who now sooth us with promises and protestations , will then intimidate us with threatenings , and , perhaps , revenge the opposition of their schemes by persecution and sequestrations .


Mr. GAGE spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , if the weakness of arguments proved the insincerity of those who produce them , I should be inclined to suspect the advocates for the establishment of new regiments , of designs very different from the defence of their country  but as their intentions can not be known , they can not be censured , and I shall , therefore , confine myself to an examination of the reasons which they have offered , and the authorities which they have cited .


The German general , who has been mentioned on this occasion with so much regard , is not less known to me than to the honourable gentleman , nor have I been less diligent to improve the hours in which I enjoyed his friendship and conversation .
Among other questions , which my familiarity with him entitled me to propose , I have asked him to what causes he imputed the ill success of the last war , and he frankly ascribed the miscarriages of it to the unhappy divisions by which the German councils were at that time embarrassed .


Faction produces nearly the same consequence in all countries , and had then influenced the imperial court , as of late the court of Great Britain , to dismiss the most able and experienced commanders , and to intrust the conduct of the war to men unequal to the undertaking  who , when they were defeated for want of skill , endeavoured to persuade their patrons and their countrymen , that they lost the victory for want of officers .


They might , perhaps , think of their countrymen , what our ministers seem to imagine of us , that to gain belief among them , it was sufficient to assert boldly , that they had not any memory of past transactions , and that , therefore , they could not observe , that the same troops were victorious under Eugene , which were defeated under the direction of his successours  nor could discover that the regulation was the same , where the effects were different .


Thus , in every place , it is the practice of men in power , to blind the people by false representations , and to impute the publick calamities rather to any other cause than their own misconduct .
It is every where equally their practice to oppress and obscure those who owe their greatness to their virtue or abilities , because they can never be reduced to blind obedience , or taught to be creatures of the ministry , because men who can discover truth , will sometimes speak it , and because those are best qualified to deceive others , who can be persuaded that they are contending for the right .


But it is surely time for this nation to rouse from indolence , and to resolve to put an end to frauds that have been so long known .
It is time to watch with more vigilance the distribution of the publick treasure , and to consider rather how to contract the national expenses , than upon what pretences new offices may be erected , and new dependencies created .
It is time to consider how our debts may be lessened , and by what expedients our taxes may be diminished .


Our taxes , sir , are such , at present , as perhaps no nation was ever loaded with before , such as never were paid to raise forces against an invader , or imposed by the insolence of victory upon a conquered people .
Every gentleman pays to the government more than two thirds of his estate , by various exactions .
-- This assertion is received , I see , with surprise , by some , whose ample patrimonies have exempted them from the necessity of nice computations , and with an affected appearance of contempt by others , who , instead of paying taxes , may be said to receive them , and whose interest it is to keep the nation ignorant of the causes of its misery , and to extenuate those calamities by which themselves are enriched .


But , sir , to endeavour to confute demonstration by a grin , or to laugh away the deductions of arithmetick , is , surely , such a degree of effrontery , as nothing but a post of profit can produce  nor is it for the sake of these men , that I shall endeavour to elucidate my assertion  for they can not but be well informed of the state of our taxes , whose chief employment is to receive and to squander the money which arises from them .


It is frequent , sir , among gentlemen , to mistake the amount of the taxes which are laid upon the nation , by passing over , in their estimates , all those which are not paid immediately out of the visible rents of their lands , and imagining that they are in no degree interested in the imposts upon manufactures or other commodities .
They do not consider that whenever they purchase any thing of which the price is enhanced by duties , those duties are levied upon them , and that there is no difference between paying ten shillings a year in land taxes , and paying five shillings in land taxes , and five shillings to manufacturers to be paid by them to the government .


It would be , in reality , equally rational for a man to please himself with his frugality , by directing half his expenses to be paid by his steward , and the event is such as might be expected from such a method of economy  for , as the steward might probably bring in false accounts , the tradesman commonly adds twopence to the price of his goods for every penny which is laid on them by the government  as it is easy to show , particularly in the prices of those two great necessaries of life , candles and leather .


Now , sir , let any gentleman add to the land tax the duties raised from the malt , candles , salt , soap , leather , distilled liquors , and other commodities used in his house  let him add the expenses of travelling so far as they are increased by the burden laid upon innkeepers , and the extortions of the tradesmen which the excises have occasioned , and he will easily agree with me that he pays more than two-thirds of his estate for the support of the government .


It can not , therefore , be doubted that it is now necessary to stop in our career of expenses , and to inquire how much longer this weight of imposts can possibly be supported .
It has already , sir , depressed our commerce , and overborne our manufactures , and if it be yet increased , if there be no hope of seeing it alleviated , every wise man will seek a milder government and enlist himself amongst slaves that have masters more wise or more compassionate .


We ought to consider , sir , whether some of our present expenses are not superfluous or detrimental , whether many of our offices are not merely pensions without employment , and whether multitudes do not receive salaries , who serve the government only by their interest and their votes .
Such offices , if they are found , ought immediately to be abolished , and such salaries withdrawn , by which a fund might be now established for maintaining the war , and afterwards for the payment of our debts .


It is not now , sir , in my opinion , a question whether we shall choose the dearest or the cheapest method of increasing our forces , for it seems to me not possible to supply any new expenses .
New troops will require more money to raise and to pay them , and more money can only be obtained by new taxes  but what now remains to be taxed , or what tax can be increased ?
The only resource left us is a lottery , and whether that will succeed is likewise a lottery  but though folly and credulity should once more operate according to our wishes , the nation is , in the meantime , impoverished , and at last lotteries must certainly fail , like other expedients .
When the publick wealth is entirely exhausted , artifice and violence will be equally vain .
And though the troops may possibly be raised , according to the estimate , I know not how we shall pay them , or from what fund , yet unmortgaged , the officers who will be entailed upon us , can hope to receive their half-pay .


For my part , sir , I think the question so easy to be decided , that I am astonished to see it the subject of a debate , and imagine that the controversy might be ended only by asking the gentleman , on whose opinion all his party appear to rely , without any knowledge or conviction of their own , whether , if he were to defend a nation from its enemies , and could procure only a small sum for the war , he would not model his forces by the cheapest method .


Mr. SLOPER then spoke thus : -- Sir , I can not , without the highest satisfaction , observe any advances made in useful knowledge , by my fellow-subjects , as the glory of such attainments must add to the reputation of the kingdom which gives rise to such elevated abilities .


This satisfaction I have received from the observations of the right honourable member , whose accurate computations can not but promise great improvements of the doctrine of arithmetick  nor can I forbear to solicit him , for the sake of the publick , to take into his consideration the present methods of traffick used by our merchants , and to strike out some more commodious method of stating the accoinpts between those two contending parties , debtor and creditor .
This he would , doubtless , execute with great reputation , who has proved , from the state of our taxes , that new forces require new funds , and that new funds can not be established without a lottery .


I am , indeed , inclined to differ from him in the last of his positions , and believe the nation not yet so much exhausted but that it may easily bear the expense of the war , and shall , therefore , vote for that establishment of our troops which will be most likely to procure success , without the least apprehension of being censured either by the present age , or by posterity , as a machine of the ministry , or an oppressor of my country .


General WADE spoke again , thus : -- Sir , since the right honourable member has been pleased to insinuate , that by answering a plain question I may put an end to the debate , I am willing to give a proof of my desire to promote unanimity in our councils , and despatch in our affairs , by complying with his proposal .


If I were obliged with a small sum to raise an army for the defence of a kingdom , I should , undoubtedly , proceed with the utmost frugality  but this noble person 's ideas of frugality would , perhaps , be very different from mine  he would think those expenses superfluous , which to me would seem indispensably necessary , and though we should both intend the preservation of the country , we should provide for its security by different methods .


He would employ the money in such a manner as might procure the greatest numbers  I should make my first inquiry after the most skilful officers , and should imagine myself obliged , by my fidelity to the nation that intrusted me with its defence , to procure their assistance , though at a high price .


It is not easy for persons who have never seen a battle or a siege , whatever may be their natural abilities , or however cultivated by reading and contemplation , to conceive the advantage of discipline and regularity , which is such , that a small body of veteran troops will drive before them multitudes of men , perhaps equally bold and resolute with themselves , if they are unacquainted with the rules of war , and unprovided with leaders to direct their motions .


I should , therefore , in the case which he has mentioned , prefer discipline to numbers , and rather enter the field with a few troops , well governed and well instructed , than with a confused multitude , unacquainted with their duty , unable to conduct themselves , and without officers to conduct them .


Mr. VINER spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , I am not very solicitous what may be the determination of the house upon this question , because I think it more necessary to resolve against an augmentation of the army , than to inquire , whether it shall be made by one method or another .


Every addition to our troops , I consider as some approach towards the establishment of arbitrary power , as it is an alienation of part of the British people , by which they are deprived of the benefits of the constitution , and subjected to rigorous laws , from which every other individual is exempt .


The principal of these laws , which all the rest are intended to enforce , requires from every soldier an unlimited and absolute obedience to the commands of his officers , who hold their commission , and expect advancement , by the same compliance with the orders of the ministry .


The danger of adding to the number of men , thus separated from their fellow-subjects , and directed by the arbitrary determinations of their officers , has been often explained with great strength and perspicuity  nor should I have taken this occasion of recalling it to the attention of the house , but that I think it a consideration , to which , in all debates on the army , the first regard ought to be paid .


Colonel MORDAUNT spoke to the purpose following : -- Sir , the objection which the honourable gentleman has raised , will be most easily removed , by considering the words of the act by which the military authority is established , where it is by no means declared , that either officers or soldiers are obliged indiscriminately to obey all the orders which they shall receive , but that they shall , on pain of the punishments there enacted , obey all the lawful orders of their commanders .


The obedience , therefore , sir , required from a soldier , is an obedience according to law , like that of any other Briton , unless it can be imagined that the word lawful is , in that place , without a meaning .
Nor does his condition differ from that of his fellow-subjects by an exemption from any law , but by a greater number of duties , and stricter obligations to the performance of them  and I am not able to conceive how our constitution can be endangered by augmenting an army , which , as it can only act in conformity to it , can act only in defence of it .


[ The question at last was put , that the new-raised troops be incorporated into the standing corps , but it passed in the negative , 232 to 166 . ]


HOUSE OF LORDS , DEC. 9 , 1740 .


DEBATE ON TAKING THE STATE OF THE ARMY INTO CONSIDERATION .


The duke of ARGYLE rose first , and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , as the present situation of our affairs may require an augmentation of our forces , and as the success of our arms , and the preservation of our liberties , may equally depend upon the manner in which the new forces shall be raised , there is , in my opinion , no question more worthy the attention of this august assembly , than what may be the most proper method of increasing our army .


On this question , my lords , I shall offer my own sentiments with greater confidence , as there are few men who have had more opportunities of being acquainted with it in its whole extent , as I have spent great part of my life in the field and in the camp .
I commanded a regiment under king William , and have long been either the first , or almost the first man in the army .


I hope , my lords , it will be allowed , without difficulty , that I have , at least , been educated at the best school of war , and that nothing but natural incapacity can have hindered me from making some useful observations upon the discipline and government of armies , and the advantages and inconveniencies of the various plans upon which other nations regulate their forces .


I have always maintained , my lords , that it is necessary , in the present state of the neighbouring countries , to keep up a body of regular troops , that we may not be less able to defend ourselves , than our enemies to attack us .


It is well known , my lords , that states must secure themselves by different means , as they are threatened by dangers of different kinds : policy must be opposed by policy , and force by force  our fleets must be increased when our neighbours grow formidable by their naval power , and armies must be maintained at a time like this , in which every prince on the continent estimates his greatness by the number of his troops .


But an army , my lords , as it is to be admitted only for the security of the nation , is to be so regulated , that it may produce the end for which it is established  that it may be useful without danger , and protect the people without oppressing them .


To this purpose , my lords , it is indispensably necessary , that the military subordination be inviolably preserved , and that discipline be discreetly exercised without any partial indulgence , or malicious severities  that every man be promoted according to his desert , and that military merit alone give any pretensions to military preferment .


To make the army yet more useful , it ought to be under the sole command of one man , exalted to the important trust by his known skill , courage , justice , and fidelity , and uncontrouled in the administration of his province by any other authority , a man enabled by his experience to distinguish the deserving , and invested with power to reward them .


Thus , my lords , ought an army to be regulated , to which the defence of a nation is intrusted , nor can any other scheme be formed which will not expose the publick to dangers more formidable than revolutions or invasions .
And yet , my lords , how widely those who have assumed the direction of affairs have deviated from this method is well known .
It is known equally to the highest and meanest officers , that those who have most opportunities of observing military merit , have no power of rewarding it  and , therefore , every man endeavours to obtain other recommendations than those of his superiours in the army , and to distinguish himself by other services than attention to his duty , and obedience to his commanders .


Our generals , my lords , are only colonels with a higher title , without power , and without command  they can neither make themselves loved nor feared in their troops , nor have either reward or punishment in their power .
What discipline , my lords , can be established by men , whom those who sometimes act the farce of obedience , know to be only phantoms of authority , and to be restrained by an arbitrary minister from the exercise of those commissions which they are invested with ?
And what is an army without discipline , subordination , and obedience ?
What , but a rabble of licentious vagrants , set free from the common restraints of decency , exempted from the necessity of labour , betrayed by idleness to debauchery , and let loose to prey upon the people ?
Such a herd can only awe the villages , and bluster in the streets , but can never be able to oppose an enemy , or defend the nation by which they are supported .


They may , indeed , form a camp upon some of the neighbouring heaths , or pass in review with tolerable regularity  they may sometimes seize a smuggler , and sometimes assist a constable with vigour and success .
But unhappy would be the people , who had no other force to oppose against an army habituated to discipline , of which every one founds his hopes of honour and reward upon the approbation of the commander .


That no man will labour to no purpose , or undergo the fatigue of military vigilance , without an adequate motive  that no man will endeavour to learn superfluous duties , and neglect the easiest road to honour and to wealth , merely for the sake of encountering difficulties , is easily to be imagined .
And , therefore , my lords , it can not be conceived , that any man in the army will very solicitously apply himself to the duties of his profession , of which , when he has learned them , the most accurate practice will avail him nothing , and on which he must lose that time , which might , have been employed in gaining an interest in a borough , or in forming an alliance with some orator in the senate .


For nothing , my lords , is now considered but senatorial interest , nor is any subordination desired but in the supreme council of the empire .
For the establishment of this new regulation , the honours of every profession are prostituted , and every commission is become merely nominal .
To gratify the leaders of the ministerial party , the most despicable triflers are exalted to an authority , and those whose want of understanding excludes them from any other employment , are selected for military commissions .


No sooner have they taken possession of their new command , and gratified with some act of oppression the wantonness of new authority , but they desert their charge with the formality of demanding a permission to be absent , which their commander dares not deny them .
Thus , my lords , they leave the care of the troops , and the study of the rules of war , to those unhappy men who have no other claim to elevation than knowledge and bravery , and who , for want of relations in the senate , are condemned to linger out their lives at their quarters , amuse themselves with recounting their actions and sufferings in former wars , and with reading in the papers of every post , the cormissions which are bestowed on those who never saw a battle .


For this reason , my lords , preferments in the army , instead of being considered as proofs of merit , are looked on only as badges of dependence  nor can any thing be inferred from the promotion of an officer , but that he is in some degree or other allied to some member of the senate , or the leading voters of a borough .


After this manner , my lords , has the army been modelled , and on these principles has it subsisted for the last and the present reign  neither myself , nor any other general officer , have been consulted in the distribution of commands , or any part of military regulations .
Our armies have known no other power than that of the secretary of war , who directs all their motions , and fills up every vacancy without opposition , and without appeal .


But never , my lords , was his power more conspicuous , than in raising the levies of last year  never was any authority more despotically exerted , or more tamely submitted to  never did any man more wantonly sport with his command , or more capriciously dispose of posts and preferments  never did any tyrant appear to set censure more openly at defiance , treat murmurs and remonstrances with greater contempt , or with more confidence and security distribute posts among his slaves , without any other reason of preference than his own uncontroulable pleasure .


And surely no man , my lords , could have made choice of such wretches for military commands , but to show that nothing but his own private inclinations should influence his conduct , and that he considered himself as supreme and unaccountable : for we have seen , my lords , the same animals to-day cringing behind a counter , and to-morrow swelling in a military dress  we have seen boys sent from school in despair of improvement , and intrusted with military command  fools that can not learn their duty , and children that can not perform it , have been indiscriminately promoted  the dross of the nation has been swept together to compose our new forces , and every man who was too stupid or infamous to learn or carry on a trade , has been placed , by this great disposer of honours , above the necessity of application , or the reach of censure .


Did not sometimes indignation , and sometimes pity , check the sallies of mirth , it would not be a disagreeable entertainment , my lords , to observe , in the park , the various appearances of these raw commanders , when they are exposing their new scarlet to view , and strutting with the first raptures of sudden elevation  to see the mechanick new-modelling his mien , and the stripling tottering beneath the weight of his cockade  or to hear the conversation of these new adventurers , and the instructive dialogues of schoolboys and shopkeepers .


I take this opportunity , my lords , of clearing myself from any suspicion of having contributed , by my advice , to this stupendous collection .
I only once interposed with the recommendation of a young gentleman , who had learned his profession in two campaigns among the Muscovians , and whom yet neither his own desert , nor my patronage could advance to a commission .
And , I believe , my lords , all the other general officers were equally unconsulted , and would , if their advice had been asked , equally have disapproved the measures that have been pursued .


But thus , my lords , were our new regiments completed , in which , of two hundred and fifty officers who have subsisted upon half-pay , only thirty-six have been promoted , though surely they might have pleaded a juster claim to employment , who had learned their profession in the service of their country , and had long languished in penury , than those who had neither knowledge nor capacity , who had neither acted nor suffered any thing , and who might have been destined to the hammer or the plough , without any disreputation to their families , or disappointment to themselves .


I have been told , indeed , my lords , that to some of these officers commissions were offered , which they refused , and for this refusal every reason is alleged but the true : some , indeed , excused themselves as disabled by age and infirmities from military service  nor can any objection be made to so just a plea .
For how could those be refused in their age the comforts of ease and repose , who have served their country with their youth and vigour ?


Others there are , my lords , who refused commissions upon motives very different , in which , nevertheless , some justice can not be denied .
They who had long studied and long practised their profession  they , who had tried their courage in the breach , and given proofs of their skill in the face of the enemy , refused to obey the command of novices , of tradesmen , and of schoolboys : they imagined , my lords , that they ought to govern those whom they should be obliged to instruct , and to lead those troops whom they must range in order .
But they had forgot that they had outlived the time when a soldier was formed by study and experience , and had not heard , in their retreats , that a colonel or a captain was now formed in a day  and , therefore , when they saw and heard their new commanders , they retired back to their half-pay , with surprise and indignation .


But , my lords , the follies of last year can not be easily rectified , and are only now to be exposed that they may not be repeated .
If we are now to make new levies , and increase the number of our land-forces , it is , in my opinion , incumbent upon us to consider by what methods we may best augment our troops , and how we may be able to resist our foreign enemies , without exposing the nation to intestine miseries , and leaving our liberties at the mercy of the court .


There are , my lords , two methods of increasing our forces  the first is , that of raising new regiments  the other , of adding new men to those which already subsist .


By raising new regiments , my lords , we shall only gratify the minister with the distribution of new commissions , and the establishment of new dependents  we shall enlarge the influence of the court , and increase the charge of the nation , which is already loaded with too many taxes to support any unnecessary expense .


By the other method , of adding a hundred men to every company , we shall not only save the pay of the officers , which is no slight consideration , but what seems , if the reports raised by the ministry of our present danger be true , of far more importance , shall form the new forces with more expedition into regular troops  for , by distributing them among those who are already instructed in their duty , we shall give them an opportunity of hourly improvement  every man 's comrade will be his master , and every one will be ambitious of forming himself by the example of those who have been in the army longer than themselves .


If it be objected , my lords , that the number of officers will not then bear a just proportion to that of the soldiers , it may be answered , that the foreign troops of the greatest reputation have no greater number of officers , as every one must know who is acquainted with the constitution of the most formidable armies of Europe .
Those of the Prussian monarch , or of the various nations by which we were assisted in the late war , either as confederates or mercenaries , have but few officers .
And I very well remember , my lords , that whenever they were joined by parties of our own nation , the inequality in the number of the officers produced contests and disputes .


The only troops of Europe , my lords , that swarm with officers , are those of France , but even these have fewer officers , in proportion to their private men , in time of war  for when they disband any part of their forces , they do not , like us , reduce their officers to half-pay , but add them to the regiments not reduced , that the families of their nobility may not be burdened with needy dependents , and that they may never want officers for new levies .


There are many reasons , my lords , that make this practice in France more reasonable than it would be in our kingdom .
It is the chief view of their governours to continue absolute , and therefore their constant endeavour to keep great numbers in dependence  it ought to be our care to hinder the increase of the influence of the court , and to obstruct all measures that may extend the authority of the ministry , and therefore those measures are to be pursued by which independence and liberty will be most supported .


It is likewise to be remembered , my lords , that a French officer is supported with pay not much larger than that of a private soldier among us , and that , therefore , the argument which arises from the necessity of frugality is not of the same force in both nations .


There is yet another reason why the French are under the necessity of employing more officers than any other nation : the strength of their armies consists in their gentlemen , who can not be expected to serve without some command : the common soldiers of the French army are a mean , spiritless , despicable herd , fit only to drudge as pioneers , to raise intrenchments , and to dig mines , but without courage to face an enemy , or to proceed with vigour in the face of danger .


Their gentlemen , my lords , are of a very different character  jealous of their honour , and conscious of their birth , eager of distinction , and ambitious of preferment .
They have , commonly , their education in the army , and have no expectations of acquiring fortunes equal to their desires by any other profession , and are , therefore , intent upon the improvement of every opportunity which is offered them of increasing their knowledge and exalting their reputation .


To the spirit of these men , my lords , are the French armies indebted for all their victories , and to them is to be attributed the present perfection of the art of war .
They have the vigilance and perseverance of Romans joined with the natural vivacity and expedition of their own nation .


We are , therefore , not to wonder , my lords , that there is in the French armies an establishment for more gentlemen than in other countries , where the disparity between the military virtues of the higher and lower classes of men is less conspicuous .
In the troops of that nation nothing is expected but from the officers , but in ours the common soldier meets danger with equal intrepidity , and scorns to see himself excelled by his officer in courage or in zeal .


We are , therefore , my lords , under no necessity of burdening our country with the expense of new commissions , which , in the army , will be superfluous , and , in the state , dangerous , as they will fill our senate with new dependents , and our corporations with new adherents to the minister , whose steady perseverance in his favourite scheme of senatorial subordination , will be , perhaps , the only occasion of these new levies , or , at least , has hindered the right application of our standing troops .
For what reason , my lords , can invention or imagination assign , why the troops , who had been for some time disciplined , were not rather sent to the assistance of Vernon than the new marines , except that some of them were commanded by men who had obtained seats in the other house , and who , by their settled adherence and avowed fidelity to the minister , had recommended themselves too powerfully to be rashly exposed in the service of their country to the bullets of the Spaniards .


So great , my lords , has been the minister 's regard to senatorial abilities , and so strict his gratitude to his friends , that I know of but one member of the other house that has been hazarded in this expedition , and he a hopeless , abandoned patriot , insensible of the capacity or integrity of our ministry , and whom nothing has been able to reconcile to our late measures .
He , therefore , who has never exerted himself in defence of the ministry , was , in his turn , thought unworthy of ministerial protection , and was given up to the chance of war without reluctance .


But I hope your lordships will concur with me in the opinion , that it is not always necessary to gratify the ministry , but that our country claims some part of our regard , and , therefore , that in establishing our army we should pursue that method which may be most accommodated to our constitution , and , instead of imitating the military policy of the French , follow the example of those nations by whose troops they have been conquered .


Had this scheme been hitherto followed , had our new levies , instead of being put under the command of boys , been distributed in just proportions among the standing regiments , where they might soon have been qualified for service by the inspection of experienced officers , we might now have seen an army capable of awing the court of Spain into submission , or , if our demands had been still refused , of revenging our injuries , and punishing those who have insulted and despised us .


From an army thus raised and disciplined , detachments , my lords , ought to have been sent on board of all our fleets , and particularly that which is now stationed in the Mediterranean , which would not then have coasted about from one port to another , without hurting or frighting the enemy , but might , by sudden descents , have spread terrour through a great part of the kingdom , harassed their troops by continual marches , and , by frequent incursions , have plundered all the maritime provinces , driven the inhabitants into the inland country , and laid the villages in ashes .


There is yet , my lords , no appearance of a peace , for our success has not enabled us to prescribe terms , and I hope we are not yet fallen so low as to receive them  it is , therefore , proper to form such resolutions as may influence the conduct of the war , and enable us to retrieve the errours of our past measures .


The minister , my lords , is not without panegyrists , who may , perhaps , endeavour to persuade us , that we ought to resign all our understandings to his superiour wisdom , and blindly trust our fortunes and our liberties to his unshaken integrity .
They will , in proof of his abilities , produce the wonderful dexterity and penetration which the late negotiations have discovered , and will confirm the reputation of his integrity by the constant parsimony of all his schemes , and the unwillingness with which he at any time increases the expenses of the nation .


But , my lords , it is the great duty of your high station to watch over the administration , and to warn those , who are more immediately intrusted with the publick affairs , against measures which may endanger the safety or happiness of the nation  and , therefore , if I have proved to your lordships , that to raise new regiments is dangerous to our liberties , that a multitude of officers is of no use in war , and that an army may be more expeditiously disciplined by adding new men to every company , I hope your lordships will agree to this resolution , which I have drawn up with the utmost brevity , and of which the meaning can not be mistaken :


`` That the augmenting the army by raising regiments , as it is the most unnecessary and expensive method of augmentation , is also the most dangerous to the liberties of the nation . ''


The duke of NEWCASTLE next spoke , to this effect : -- My lords , as my education and employments have afforded me no opportunity of acquiring any skill in military affairs , it will not be expected by your lordships , that I should be able to confute the arguments of the noble duke , whose acknowledged superiority in the art of war , and the abilities which he has displayed in the administration of every province which he has undertaken , give him a claim to the highest deference .


But , my lords , as I can not assume the province of disputing on this question , so I can not , without longer consideration , form any resolution concerning it  for arguments may be fallacious , which , yet , I can not confute , and to approve without knowledge is no less weak than to censure .


There is not any present necessity , my lords , of forming a resolution on this subject  we are not now called upon particularly to consider it , and certainly it can not be prudent , by so determinate a decision , pronounced without reflection or deliberation , to preclude a fuller examination of this important question .


Lord CARTERET rose , and spoke in this manner : -- My lords , the noble duke who made the present motion has supported it by such strength of argument , and so fully explained the advantages of the method which it tends to recommend , that not only the present age , but posterity may , probably , be indebted to him , for juster notions of a military establishment , than have been yet attained even by those whose profession obliges them to such inquiries .


Nor , my lords , could we expect less from his long experience and extensive capacity  experience gained in the heat of war , and in the midst of danger  a capacity not only cultivated by solitary disquisitions in retirement and security , but exercised by difficulties , and quickened by opposition .


Such abilities , my lords , matured by such an education , have justly made the noble duke the oracle of war , and procured him the esteem and reverence of all the powers upon earth .


As I did not receive from my education any military knowledge , I am not able to add much to the arguments which your lordships have already heard  but , nevertheless , having been under the necessity of regulating the army when I had the honour to be employed in Ireland , and having made , in those countries where I transacted the business of the crown , some observations upon the different forms of military establishments , I hope I shall be allowed to offer what my experience or my remarks may suggest to me , in confirmation of the sentiments of the noble duke .


When I was in Ireland , my lords , the troops of that kingdom consisted of twenty-one regiments , of which ten were , as last year , brought into Britain , and the Irish forces were to be filled up by new levies , which were raised in the manner now proposed , by increasing every regiment from three hundred and forty to six hundred men  so that the eleven regiments remaining composed a body of nearly the same number with the twenty-one regiments , as formerly constituted .


Of the Swedish establishment , my lords , the reputation and success of their troops are an uncontrovertible vindication , attd I have often had an opportunity of comparing the number of officers with that of ours , and found their private men to be far more numerous in proportion to the officers .


In Hanover , my lords , I have seen his majesty 's troops remarkable for the elegance of their appearance  and being once asked , by the commander , at what expense one of those gallant troopers and his horse was supported , was told , after confessing my ignorance , that he cost no more than fourteen pounds a year , who could not , in this country , be maintained for less than forty .


I believe , my lords , that the French forces are not more expensive than those of Hanover , and , therefore , we are by no means to imitate their establishment , for the price of provisions and habits of life do not admit of any diminution of the pay of either our officers or soldiers , and we can only lessen our expenses by reducing their numbers , to which I shall , for my part , most willingly contribute .


But as this , my lords , is not the proper time for disbanding our forces , of which the present state of our affairs may , perhaps , demand an augmentation , it is necessary to compare the state of our forces with that of foreign troops , and supply , by prudent methods , the disadvantages to which we are subject , by the peculiar condition of our country .
For , if the French can support an army at a fourth part of our expense , what must be the consequence of a war , supposing the wealth of the two nations nearly equal ?
It will be to little purpose that we boast , however justly , of the superiority of our troops  for though it should be granted that the British can not be resisted by an equal number , yet it can never be expected that they should conquer troops four times as numerous as themselves .


Thus , my lords , it appears , with all the evidence of arithmetical demonstration , that the method now proposed is highly expedient , nor can any objection , in my opinion , be made to the resolution offered to your lordships .


That this is not a proper time for this inquiry has been , indeed , urged , but surely no time can be more proper than when we may , by a resolution unanimously passed , regulate , in some degree , the conduct of the other house , and faint to them the opinion of this assembly on a question which is , perhaps , to-morrow to be brought before them .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY then spoke thus : -- My lords , though I was once honoured with a command in the army , and consequently ought to have attained some military knowledge , yet I have so long resigned my commission , possessed it for so short a time , and have suffered my attention to be diverted from inquiries on that subject by employments of so different a kind , that I can not presume to oppose any knowledge of my own to the reasons which have been offered  but I can not think that the conclusions drawn by the noble duke , are so evidently true as to force conviction , and exclude all possibility of reply  nor can I conceive it consistent with the dignity of this assembly , to yield implicitly to any man 's assertions , or to pass any resolution without an accurate inquiry .


Some objections , my lords , arise , upon reflection , from my narrow observation and transient reading , and these I shall lay before your lordships , with an open acknowledgment of my insufficiency to discuss the question , and a sincere desire of being instructed where I may be mistaken .


The subordination of the army , my lords , appears to me , in general , to be sufficiently maintained , nor is it ever infringed but by particular partiality , that can never be prevented , or a casual difference in the circumstances of the officers , which , though not relative to their military characters , will always produce some degree of influence .


I know not , my lords , how the general regulation of our forces , and the distribution of military honours , can be condemned , without extending some degree of censure to a person who ought not to be mentioned as concurring in any measures injurious to the publick .
Our army , my lords , is maintained by the parliament , but commanded by the king , who has not either done or directed any thing of which his people may justly complain .


Here the duke of ARGYLE interrupted him : -- My lords , it is necessary to clear myself from misrepresentations , and to preserve , at the same time , the order of this assembly , by reminding the noble lord , that his majesty is never to be introduced into our debates , because he is never to be charged with wrong  and by declaring to your lordships , that I impute no part of the errours committed in the regulation of the army to his majesty , but to those ministers whose duty it is to advise him , and whom the law condemns to answer for the consequences of their counsels .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY resumed : -- My lords , if I misrepresented any assertion of the noble duke , it was by misapprehension , or failure of memory , and not by malice or design  and if in any other objections which I shall make , I shall fall into any errour of the same kind , I desire that it may be ascribed to the same cause .


The ignorance and inexperience of our present officers have been exposed with great gaiety of imagination , and with the true spirit of satirical rhetorick , nor can I presume to support them against so formidable censures .
But , my lords , I can not discover any method of protracting the lives of our old officers beyond the usual term , nor of supplying the loss of those whom death takes away from the army , but by substituting others , who , as they have seen no wars , can have little experience .


With regard to the number of officers in the foreign troops , I have been informed , that they were , by an express stipulation , to be constituted in the same manner with the British and Dutch forces .


Then the duke of ARGYLE again interrupted him : -- My lords , as it was my province in the late war to superintend the payment of the foreign troops , I may be allowed to have some knowledge of the establishment , and hope I shall not be imagined to need any information on that subject .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY said : -- My lords , I do not presume to dispute any assertion of the noble duke , for whose knowledge I have the highest veneration , but only to offer such hints for inquiry as may be pursued by other lords of greater abilities , and to show , that as some difficulties may be raised , the resolution ought not to be agreed to without farther deliberation  since it not only tends to prescribe the measures which shall be hereafter taken , and prohibit a method of raising forces , which , when diligently examined , may , perhaps , appear most eligible , but to censure the methods , which , when they were put in practice the last year , received the approbation of all the powers of the legislature .


Lord WESTMORELAND spoke next , as follows : -- My lords , I have , for my own satisfaction , stated the difference of the expense between the two methods of raising forces , and find it so great , that the method proposed by the noble duke ought , undoubtedly , to be preferred , even though it were attended with some inconvenience , from which he has shown it to be free .


Frugality , my lords , is one of the chief virtues of an administration  a virtue without which no government can be long supported : the publick expense can never be too accurately computed , or the first tendency to profusion too rigorously opposed  for as in private life , so in political economy , the demands of necessity are easily supplied  but if once the calls of wantonness and caprice are complied with , no limits can be fixed , nor will any treasure be sufficient .


Whether the burdens under which the people are now toiling were all imposed by necessity , I will not inquire , but I think , my lords , we may readily determine , that whatever is not necessary is cruel and oppressive , and that , therefore , since the expense of raising new regiments appears , at least , not to be necessary , it ought to be opposed  and how can it be opposed more properly or effectually than by the noble duke 's resolution ?


Lord HERVEY spoke to this effect : -- My lords , I do not claim any superiority of knowledge in any affairs that relate to the publick , but have less acquaintance with the military establishment than with any other part of the government , and can , therefore , neither oppose the resolution now offered to your lordships by such arguments as may deserve your attention , nor agree to it with that degree of conviction which the importance of it seems to require .


That the chief argument which has been produced against raising new regiments , is less formidable than it has been represented , will , I believe , appear to your lordships , when it is considered that the officers are always gentlemen of the first families in the empire , who , therefore , can not be supposed voluntarily to give up their relations and posterity to the power of any ministry , or , for the sake of their commissions , to betray that constitution by which their own properties are secured .


Whether every other argument may not with equal justice be controverted , is not , without longer consideration , possible to be determined , and , therefore , it can not be reasonably expected that we should agree to the resolution , which would be only to decide without examination , and to determine what we do n't understand  for I am under no apprehension of being imagined to reflect unjustly on this assembly , in supposing that many of your lordships may be strangers to the question , which , when the last levies were made , was neither discussed nor proposed .


I therefore move , that the previous question may be put , which may , perhaps , gain time sufficient for a more exact inquiry upon this important subject .


Lord TALBOT replied to this purport : -- My lords , if , in imitation of some noble lords , I profess my ignorance of the subject on which I am to speak , may it not yet be allowed me , after the example of others , to employ the little knowledge which I have in the defence of a resolution , which appears to have no other tendency than the advantage of the publick , and to show my zeal for the happiness of my country , though , perhaps , without the true knowledge of its interest ?


The noble lord , who spoke last , is too great a master of eloquence not to be heard with all the attention which pleasure naturally produces , and a reasoner too formidable not to raise in his hearers all the anxiety which is produced by the fear of being deceived by partial representations , and artful deductions .
I am always afraid , my lords , lest errour should appear too much like truth in the ornaments which his lordship 's imagination may bestow , and lest sophistry should dazzle my understanding whilst I imagine myself only guided by the light of reason .


I shall , therefore , endeavour , my lords , to review his ornaments , and try whether they owe their influence to the force of truth , or to that of eloquence .


His lordship has observed , that the objections which are now made to the method of raising new regiments , were not produced last year upon a like occasion .
I know not , indeed , what can be inferred from this assertion  for , surely , it will not maintain , that an errour , once admitted , is to become perpetual .


But , my lords , another reason may be assigned , for which the objections that occurred last year might not be produced .
The ministry , after a long course of disgraceful negotiations , and artful delays , were , at length , compelled to a war , by the general clamours of the whole nation  but they acted as men unwilling to execute what they did not approve .
They proceeded so slowly in their preparations , and were so languid in all their motions , that it was evident how willingly they would have improved every opportunity of retarding the vengeance which they were forced to threaten  and with what artifices they would have protracted any delay , which they could have imputed to those by whom they were opposed .
It was , therefore , to the last degree , improper to embarrass their measures of themselves sufficiently perplexed , or to lay any obstacle in the way of those who would gladly be stopped .


That the army is filled with gentlemen , is so far , my lords , from proving that there is nothing to be feared from it , that it is the only foundation of all our solicitude .
For none but gentlemen can injure our liberties , and while the posts of the army are bestowed as rewards of senatorial slavery , gentlemen will always be found who will be corrupted themselves , and can corrupt a borough  who will purchase a vote in the house , and sell it for military preferments .
By the posts of the army the senate may be corrupted , and by the corruption of the senate the army be perpetuated .


Those , my lords , who are the warmest opponents of the army , apprehend not any danger from their swords , but from their votes .
As they have been of late regulated without discipline or subordination , I should not feel such anxiety at seeing them led on by their new commanders against a body of honest ploughmen , united in the cause of virtue and of liberty  I should , with great alacrity , draw my sword against them , and should not doubt of seeing them in a short time heaped upon our fields .


But , my lords , they are employed to ruin us by a more slow and silent method  they are directed to influence their relations in the senate , and to suborn the voters in our small towns  they are dispersed over the nation to instil dependence , and being enslaved themselves , willingly undertake the propagation of slavery .


That the army is instrumental in extending the influence of the ministry to the senate , can not be denied , when military preferments are held no longer than while he that possesses them gives a sanction , by his vote , to the measures of the court  when no degree of merit is sufficient to balance a single act of senatorial opposition , and when the nation is rather to be left to the defence of boys , than the minister be suspected of misconduct .


Could either bravery or knowledge , reputation , or past services , known fidelity to his majesty , or the most conspicuous capacity for high trust , have secured any man in the enjoyment of his post , the noble duke who made the motion , had carried his command to his grave , nor had the nation now been deprived either of his arms , or of his counsels .


But , as he has now offered his advice to his country , and supported his opinion with proofs from reason and experience , which even those who oppose them have confessed themselves unable to answer  as the justness of his reasoning , and the extent of his knowledge , have silenced those whose prejudices will not suffer them to own themselves convinced  let us not , my lords , reject what we can not condemn , nor suffer our country to be defrauded of the advantage of this resolution , by that low senatorial craft , the previous question .


Then the CHANCELLOR spoke to the following purpose : -- My lords , I am far from suspecting that an open profession of my inability to examine the question before us , in its full extent , will be imputed to an affectation of modesty , since any knowledge of military affairs could not be acquired in those stations in which I have been placed , or by those studies , in which the greatest part of my life is known to have been spent .


It will not be expected , my lords , that I should attempt a formal confutation of the noble duke 's positions , or that I should be able to defend my own opinion against his knowledge and experience  nor would I , my lords , expose myself to the censure of having harangued upon war in the presence of Hannibal .


The noble duke has explained his sentiments to your lordships with the utmost accuracy of method , and the most instructive perspicuity of language  he has enforced them with a strength of reasoning rarely to be found , and with an extent of knowledge peculiar to himself .
Yet , my lords , as his arguments , however powerful in themselves , do not strike me with the same force with which others may be affected , who are more capable of receiving them , I hope that your lordships will allow me to mention such objections as occur to me , that in voting on this question I may , at least , preserve my conscience from violation , and neither adopt the opinion of another , however great , without examination , nor obstinately reject the means of conviction .


Every lord who has spoken either in support of the noble duke 's opinion , or in opposition to it , has confessed that he is very little acquainted with the subject of our debate  and it may not , therefore , be an improper or useless attempt , if I endeavour by objections , however injudicious , or by arguments , however inconclusive , to procure some illustration of a question so important , and , at the same time , so little understood .


The objections , my lords , which I shall produce , are such as I have heard in conversation with those whose long acquaintance with military employments give them a just claim to authority in all questions which relate to the art of war  among whom I find no uniformity of opinion with regard to the most proper method of augmenting our forces .
And , my lords , when we observe those to differ in their sentiments , whose education , experience , and opportunities of knowledge have been nearly the same , and who have all obtained a very great degree of reputation in their profession , what can be inferred , but that the question is in its own nature obscure and difficult ?
That it involves a multitude of relations , and is diffused through a great variety of circumstances ?
And that , therefore , it is prudent for every man , who can judge only upon the authority of others , to suspend his opinion ?


The chief argument , or that , at least , which impressed itself most strongly on my mind , against any innovation in our military constitution , was drawn from the success of our armies in their present form , with that proportion of soldiers and officers , which the present motion tends to abolish .
Our forces , say the advocates for the present establishment , have afforded us a sufficient testimony of the propriety of their regulation , by their frequent victories over troops , whose discipline has been studied with the utmost vigilance , and which have been trained up to war with a degree of attention not disproportioned to the mighty design for which they were raised , the subjection of the world , and attainment of universal monarchy .
These troops , who have been taught , almost from their infancy , that cowardice and flight are the greatest crimes , and persuaded , by national prejudices , and principles studiously instilled , that no foreign forces could withstand them , have fled before equal numbers of Britons , and been driven from one province to another , till , instead of grasping at general dominion , they were reduced to defend their wives and children .


How much of this success was to be ascribed to that part of the regulation which this motion proposes to be changed , it is not , my lords , within my province to determine  the great commander whom I have the honour to oppose , can best explain to your lordships the province of every officer in the field , and how far the number of inferiour officers may influence the success of a battle and the fate of a kingdom .


But to me , my lords , the establishment of our armies , comprising different views , and connecting various subordinate regulations , may be compared to a medicine composed of different ingredients , and found infallibly efficacious in a dangerous disease , in which , though some of the parts may seem to physicians of the profoundest learning , superfluous or improper , it would be no less than the folly of preferring experiments to life , to make any alteration .


The wantonness of innovation , my lords , is a dangerous disease of the mind  in a private station , it prompts men to be always discontented with what they find , and to lose the enjoyment of good in search of something better  it incites them to leave the safe and beaten tracks of life , in search of those which they imagine nearer , but , which are , at best , less secure , and which generally lead them to points far different from that to which they originally intended to direct their course .


It is dangerous , my lords , to admit any alteration which is not absolutely necessary , for one innovation makes way for another .
The parts of a constitution , like a complicated machine , are fitted to each other , nor can one be changed without changing that which corresponds to it .
This necessity is not always foreseen , but when discovered by experience is generally complied with  for every man is more inclined to hazard farther changes , than to confess himself mistaken by retracting his scheme .
Thus , my lords , one change introduces another , till the original constitution is entirely destroyed .


By the ambition of innovation , my lords , have almost all those empires been destroyed , of which nothing now is left but the memory .
Every human establishment has its advantages and its inconveniencies , and by weak attempts to remedy these defects , which , notwithstanding the utmost attention , will embarrass the machine of government , alterations have been introduced which have been quickly followed by a total dissolution .


There seem , my lords , to be few regulations on which it is more dangerous to make experiments than on that of the armies of a nation .
We are sufficiently convinced how much of success is the consequence of courage , and that courage is only an opinion of our own superiority , arising from certain circumstances , either imaginary or real .


The courage which at present animates our forces , arises , my lords , from a very proper ground , their former victories over the enemies which they are now to combat , and will , therefore , doubtless , continue while they can consider themselves as enjoying the same advantage with those particular men by whom the victories were obtained .
But , my lords , if any essential part of their establishment be changed , they will be considered , both by themselves and their enemies , as a different army  they will then charge with less alacrity , and be opposed with less dejection  they will consider themselves as fighting without that certainty of success which arises from experience , and their enemies will resolve to try , by an obstinate resistance , whether they are now equally formidable as in their former state .


Thus , my lords , I have attempted , however weakly , to represent the arguments which I have heard for the continuance of the establishment , of which your lordships will examine the validity , and shall now proceed to consider the noble duke 's system of a military subordination in time of peace .


Whether a standing army in time of peace is made necessary to the change of conduct in foreign courts , it is now useless to inquire  but it will be easily granted by your lordships , that no motive but necessity , necessity absolute and inevitable , ought to influence us to support a standing body of regular forces , which have always been accounted dangerous , and generally found destructive to a free people .


The chief reason , my lords , of the danger arising from a standing army , may be ascribed to the circumstances by which men , subject to military laws , are distinguished from other members of the same community  they are , by the nature of martial government , exposed to punishment which other men never incur , and tried by forms of a different and more rigorous kind than those which are practised by the civil power .
They are , if not exempted from the jurisdiction of a magistrate , yet subject to another authority which they see more frequently and more severely exerted , and which , therefore , they fear and reverence in a higher degree .
They , by entering into the army , lay aside , for the most part , all prospect of advantage from commerce or civil employments , and , in a few years , neither fear nor hope any thing but from the favour or displeasure of their own officers .


For these , my lords , or for other reasons , the soldiers have always been inclined to consider themselves as a body distinct from the rest of the community , and independent on it , a government regulated by their own laws , without regard to the general constitution of their country  they have , therefore , been ready to subvert the constitution , from which they received little advantage , and to oppress the civil magistrates , for whom they had lost their reverence .


And how soon , my lords , might such outrages be expected from an army formed after the model of the noble duke , released from the common obligations of society , disunited from the bulk of the nation , directed solely by their own officers , and ultimately commanded by a man who had the right of commanding no other ?
Would they not soon consider themselves as a separate community , whose interests were , no less than their laws , peculiar to themselves ?
Would they not consider him , from whom they received all their rewards , and all their punishments , as the proper object of their supreme regard , and endeavour to exalt him to the same dominion over others , which he enjoyed in regard to themselves , that they might share in his superiority ?


A body of men , my lords , thus separated from the rest of the people , must consider themselves as either ennobled or degraded by such distinction , and would soon find themselves inclined to use the power of their arms , either in the exertion of their privileges , or the revenge of their disgrace .
Then , my lords , would they set at defiance the laws of the nation , nor would one of these noble lords be able to disband , nor the other to resist them .


The army , my lords , is , in time of peace , then best regulated when it is kept under the strictest subordination to the civil power , that power which it is instituted to protect and to preserve .


Thus , my lords , have I examined the proposal and reasons of the noble duke , perhaps not much to the information of your lordships  but it can not be expected that any capacity should be able , in an unexpected and sudden debate , to dispute on a subject , which the noble duke 's education gave him particular opportunities of understanding far beyond almost every other man , and which he has had time to consider with respect to this present motion .


For this reason , my lords , I can not but think the previous question highly expedient , but not for this reason alone  for as the state of the army , and the proper methods of augmenting it , are soon to be examined by the other house , to prejudice their determinations , may raise a contest about privileges , and oblige us either to persist , for our own honour , in opposition to measures necessary to the security of the publick , or , in compliance with the present exigence , accept their scheme , however opposite to our own resolution .


Lord CARTERET spoke in substance as follows : -- My lords , the known abilities of that noble lord incline me always to hear him with uncommon expectation and attention , which seldom fail to be rewarded by such pleasure and information as few other men are able to afford .
But his observations on the question before us , my lords , have only convinced me , that the greatest abilities may be sometimes betrayed into errour , and the most candid disposition be vitiated by accidental prejudices .
For his own arguments neither appear just , nor his representation impartial , of those advanced in favour of the motion .


With regard to the number of officers necessary in time of war , his lordship asserted nothing from his own knowledge , nor do I believe that any other lord will imagine himself qualified to dispute with the noble duke upon questions purely military .
His experience entitles him to the highest authority , in debates of this kind  and if every man has a claim to credit in his own profession , surely , he who has given evidence of his proficiency in the art of war in the eyes of the whole world , will not be denied , in this house , that superiority which would readily be allowed him in any other part of the universe .


And yet less , my lords , can it be suspected , that he intends to deceive us , than that he can be deceived himself  for not only his probity , his love of his country , and his fidelity to the crown , concur to secure him from any temptations to make an ill use of his credit , but his own interest obliges him to offer that scheme for the regulation of our forces , which , in his own opinion , will most certainly contribute to their success .
For it is not to be doubted , my lords , that when we shall be engaged in war too far for negotiations and conventions , when we shall be surrounded by enemies , and terrified at the near approach of danger , he will be called upon to lead our armies to battle , and attack , once more , those enemies that have fled so often before him .


Then , my lords , if he has contributed to form a weak plan of our military constitution , must he atone for it with the loss of his reputation  that reputation , for which he has undergone so many fatigues , and been exposed to so many dangers .


But , my lords , it is ridiculous to suspect where nothing appears to provoke suspicion , and I am very far from imagining that the dangers of innovation , however artfully magnified , or the apprehensions of the soldiers , however rhetorically represented , will be thought of any weight .


The establishment of the army , my lords , is an innovation , and , as the noble lord has justly represented it , an innovation that threatens nothing less than the destruction of our liberties , and the dissolution of our government .
Our vigilance ought , therefore , to be very anxiously employed in regulating this new part of our government , and adapting it , in such a manner , to the national constitution , that no detriment may arise from it , and that our civil rights may be protected , not oppressed , by the military power .


To this purpose , says the noble lord , the soldiers are to be restrained by a due subordination to the magistrate , a position undoubtedly true , but now superfluously urged : for it was never controverted by the noble person whose opinion he intended to oppose .


Should any man assert , my lords , that the army ought to be formed into a distinct and independent society , which should receive laws only from a council of war , and have no other governour than their officers , none should oppose such an assertion with more ardour or constancy than myself , but what was never advanced it is unnecessary to confute .


Yet , my lords , to obviate those dangers from the army which have been so strongly and justly represented , it is necessary , not only that a legal subordination to the civil authority be firmly established , but that a personal dependence on the ministry be taken away .


How readily men learn to reverence and obey those on whom their fortunes depend , has been already shown by the noble lord , and therefore it will follow , that a minister who distributes preferments at his pleasure , may acquire such an influence in the army , as may be employed to secure himself from justice by the destruction of liberty .
And unless it can be proved , that no such minister can ever exist  that corruption , ambition , and perfidy , have place only in the military race  every argument that shows the danger of an army , dependent only on the general , will show the danger , likewise , of one dependent only on the minister .


The influence of the minister , my lords , is known to arise from the number of the officers , and to be proportioned to the value of the preferment , which it is in his power to bestow  it is , therefore , evident , by adding new officers to our army , we shall throw weight into the scale , which already is , at least , an equal balance to our constitution , and enable the ministry either to employ an army in defence of their measures , or to obtain such an influence in the senate , as shall make any other security superfluous .


Such , my lords , is the danger of a multitude of officers , a danger which surely deserves more attention than the imaginary prejudice of the soldiers in favour of the present establishment  a prejudice represented so powerful , both in our own forces , and those of our enemies , that the future success of our arms may probably depend upon it .


Surely , my lords , that cause may be allowed indefensible , which such a patron defends so weakly .
What can be more chimerical than to imagine that men would lay down their arms , and forsake their standards , because there are twenty more in a company than have formerly been ?
That such a panick , from such a cause , was never found , I need not prove  and I scarce think it necessary to assert , that , without supposing a universal depravity of reason , it never can be found .


The establishment proposed by the noble duke , is the same with that of most foreign troops , and particularly with that of his majesty 's forces in his foreign dominions , and , therefore , can not but be approved by him , if it should be proposed by your lordships .
For why should he imagine a greater number of officers necessary to the troops of Britain , than to those of any other nation .


The expediency of the motion , my lords , is , in my opinion , so obvious and incontestable , as to require no farther consideration , and , therefore , it is no argument against it , that we were not previously informed of the question .


Much less , my lords , can I discover the force of the assertion , that by such a resolution we shall excite the displeasure of the other house  we have , my lords , at least , an equal right with them to examine any position relating to the publick security , a right which we may exert with less danger of disgusting them , while they have yet formed no determination , and with less danger to the nation , than when their opinion , whatever it may be , can not be controverted without retarding the important bill against mutiny .


We are never offended , my lords , at receiving the opinions of the other house , which we often adopt without any alteration , and often make use of for our own instruction , and now are become so contemptible as that no regard should be paid by them to our resolutions .


It is well known , my lords , that this assembly is an essential and constituent part of the legislature of this kingdom , and that we received from our ancestors a great extent of power , which it ought to be our care not to suffer to be contracted by degrees , till this assembly shall become merely formal , and sit only to ratify implicitly the determinations of the other house .


[ Several other lords spoke in the debate , and the president having put the previous question , `` Whether the question should be then put ? ''
upon a division , it passed in the negative .

HOUSE OF COMMONS , DECEMBER 12 , 1740 .


RESPECTING OFFICERS ON HALF-PAY .


Mr. SANDYS this day moved for an humble address to his majesty , that , for the future ease of his majesty 's subjects , all officers now subsisting upon half-pay , etc. might be employed in the army , and supported it to the following effect :


Sir , though I have often known motions opposed without any just objections , or at least without any proof of such inconveniencies likely to arise from them , as were equivalent to the advantages which they would have produced , yet I can not but confess , that any opposition to this will be unexpected and surprising  for it is , in my opinion , supported by every law of justice and humanity .
If we regard the publick in general , it can not but produce some alleviation of the national expense  and if we consider the particular persons to whom it immediately relates , they have certainly a just claim to that regard which it is the tendency of this motion to procure them .


To burden with superfluous officers , and unnecessary expenses , a people already overwhelmed with taxes , and overrun with the dependents on the crown , is , surely , to the highest degree cruel and absurd .
And to condemn those men to contempt and penury , who have served their country with bravery and fidelity , to prefer unexperienced striplings to those commissions , which would gladly be accepted by men who have already tried their courage in the battle , and borne the fatigues of marches , and the change of climates , is surely not only to oppress the deserving , and scatter promotion without just distinction  but , what is yet more enormous , it is to wanton with the publick safety , and expose us to our enemies .


Nor does it appear to me sufficient , that the veteran officers be restored to the commissions which they formerly enjoyed  they ought , upon an augmentation of our troops , to be recompensed by some advancement for their services and their sufferings  the ensign ought to become a lieutenant , and the lieutenant be exalted to a captain  stations which they will surely fill with more dignity and greater abilities , than boys newly discharged from school , and intrusted with unexpected authority .


If it be reasonable , sir , that expense should be spared in a time of general poverty , if it be politick to carry on war in the manner most likely to produce success , if it be just , that those who have served their country should be preferred to those who have no merit to boast , this motion can not be rejected .


Sir William YONGE answered to this purpose : -- Sir , to the motion now made , it will not , I believe , be objected , that it is unreasonable , or unjust , but that it is unnecessary , and that it is not drawn up with sufficient consideration .


It is unnecessary , because his majesty is advised by it to no other measures than those which he has already determined to pursue  for he has declared to me , sir , his intention of conferring the new commissions upon the officers who receive half-pay , before any other officers shall be promoted .


The motion appears to me not to be very attentively considered , or drawn up with great propriety of expression  for it supposes all the half-pay officers fit for the service , which can not be imagined by any man , who considers that there has been peace for almost thirty years  a space of time , in which many vigorous constitutions must have declined , and many , who were once well qualified for command , must be disabled by the infirmities of age .
Nor is the promotion of one of these gentlemen considered always by him as an act of favour  many of them have , in this long interval of peace , engaged in methods of life very little consistent with military employments , many of them have families which demand their care , and which they would not forsake for any advantages which a new commission could afford them , and therefore it would not be very consistent with humanity to force them into new dangers and fatigues which they are now unable to support .


With regard to these men , compassion and kindness seem to require that they should be suffered to spend their few remaining days without interruption , and that the dangers and toils of their youth should be requited in their age with ease and retirement .


There are others who have less claim to the regard of the publick , and who may be passed by in the distribution of new preferments without the imputation of neglecting merit .
These are they who have voluntarily resigned their commissions for the sake of half-pay , and have preferred indolence and retreat to the service of their country .


So that it appears , that of those who subsist upon half-pay , some are unable to execute a commission , some do not desire , and some do not deserve it  and with regard to the remaining part , which can be no great number , I have already stated the intention of his majesty , and therefore can not but conclude that the motion is needless .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke as follows : -- Sir , I know not by what fatality it is , that all the motions made by one party are reasonable and necessary , and all that are unhappily offered by the other , are discovered either to be needless , or of pernicious tendency .
Whenever a question can be clouded and perplexed , the opponents of the ministry are always mistaken , confuted , and , in consequence of the confutations , defeated by the majority of votes .
When truth is too notorious to be denied , and too obvious to be contested , the administration claim the honour of the first discovery , and will never own that they were incited to their duty by the remonstrances of their opponents , though they never , before those remonstrances , had discovered the least intention of performing it .


But that the motion is allowed to be just and proper , is sufficient  the importance of it will be easily discovered .
For my part I shall always consider that motion as important , which tends to contract the expenses of the publick , to rescue merit from neglect , and to hinder the increase of the dependents on the ministry .


Sir Robert WALPOLE answered : -- Sir , there is no temper more opposite to that incessant attention to the welfare of the publick , which is the perpetual boast of those who have signalized themselves by opposing the measures of the administration , than a lust of contradiction , and a disposition to disturb this assembly with superfluous debates .


Whether this disposition is not discovered in the reply made to the declaration of his majesty 's intentions , and the confession of the propriety of the motion , let the house determine .
It must surely be confessed , that it is not necessary to advise what is already determined .


Nor is it less evident , that many of the officers whose interest is now so warmly solicited , must be incapacitated by their age for service , and unable to receive any benefit from the offer of new commissions .
To deny this , is to question the flux of time , or to imagine that the constitution of a soldier is exempt from its injuries .


Mr. SANDYS explained himself to this effect : -- Sir , I am far from intending by this motion to fill the army with decrepit officers , or to obstruct in any manner the service of the publick  nor have I any other intention , than to secure to those whose years permit , and whose inclinations incite them to enter once more into the army , that preferment to which they have a claim , not only from their past services , but from the state of penury and obscurity in which they have languished .


I desire to preserve those , whose valour has heretofore made our nation the terrour of the world , from the mortification of seeing themselves insulted by childhood , and commanded by ignorance  by ignorance exalted to authority by the countenance of some rhetorician of the senate , or some mayor of a borough .


Whoever has observed the late distribution of military honours , will easily discover that they have been attained by qualifications very different from bravery , or knowledge of the art of war  he will find that regiments and companies are the rewards of a seasonable vote , and that no man can preserve his post in the army , whether given him as the reward of acknowledged merit , or sold him for the full value , any longer than he employs all his influence in favour of the ministry .


Sir Robert WALPOLE then said : -- Sir , it has been already admitted , that the motion can only be objected to as superfluous , and , therefore , all farther debate is mere waste of time , without any prospect of advantage  nor is any thing now necessary , but to review the motion , and correct such expressions as may be thought inaccurate or improper .


That all the half-pay officers are not able to enter into the service , has been already shown , and , therefore , I should imagine , that , instead of all the officers , we might very justly substitute officers properly qualified .


Sir John BARNARD replied : -- Sir , though I can not discover the necessity of any alteration , since it can not be conceived that the senate can advise impossibilities , yet since so much accuracy is affected , it may be allowed that the word all shall be left out , as seeming to imply more than can be intended .


But the honourable gentleman is not , in my opinion , so happy in his amendment , as in his objection  for the words properly qualified convey to me no distinct idea .
He that is qualified is , I suppose , properly qualified , for I never heard of improper qualifications  but if the word properly be omitted , I have no objection to the amendment .


This motion was agreed to .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , JAN. 24 , 1740-1 .


[ DEBATE ON AN ADDRESS FOR PAPERS RELATING TO ADMIRAL HADDOCK . ]


Mr. WALLER this day offered the following motion in writing , That an humble address be presented to his majesty , that he will be graciously pleased to give directions that there may be laid before this house copies of two particular letters written by his majesty 's secretary of state to admiral Haddock , which had been addressed for before , and of the letters received from admiral Ogle mentioned therein  together with all letters written by admiral Haddock to either of his majesty 's secretaries of state , concerning the said letters , and the execution of the orders contained therein .


This motion he supported by arguments to the following effect : -- Sir , no man who considers the present situation of our foreign affairs , the expense and inefficacy of our military preparations , the appearance of negligence in our naval expeditions , and the general disappointment of the hopes which the nation had conceived of victories , vengeance , and reparations , can , in my opinion , doubt the expediency of the motion which I have taken the liberty to make .


When the expectations of the nation are deceived , it certainly becomes those who are deputed to watch over the prosperity of the publick , to inquire whence the disappointment proceeds , and either to inform their constituents that their uneasiness arises from their own errour , and that their hopes are destroyed because they had no rational foundation  or to detect the weak management of those by whom the publick measures have been ill-conducted , or the national treasure has been misapplied .


With regard , sir , to the present war , I know not how the nation can be charged with having formed unreasonable expectations .
If they considered the speech from the throne , the most authentick declaration of the intentions of the government , they found there the warmest resentments of the injuries which they had sustained , and the strongest assurances of a vigorous prosecution of all those measures which might produce speedy recompense , and inviolable security .


If they reflect , sir , on the preparations for war , on the multitude of ships , the demand of materials for naval equipments , and the high prices at which workmen were retained , they could not but imagine that either some mighty attempt was designed , or some formidable enemy dreaded , and as they know not whom they had to fear , they ascribed the vigour of our proceedings to a resolution of humbling our enemies by one fatal blow , and re-establishing our naval dominion by a single effort .


And justly , sir , might they indulge this pleasing imagination  with reason might they anticipate a triumph over an enemy whose strength bears no proportion to the force that was fitted out against them , and expect that in a few months they should see the ambassadors of Spain supplicating for peace .


To raise their expectations yet higher , their trade was suspended by an embargo , long continued , and in the strictest manner enforced , and the impresses were let loose upon the sailors  they saw nothing omitted , however grievous to the nation , that could contribute to make it formidable , and bore part of the miseries of war without impatience , in hopes of being rewarded by military glory , and repaid by the plunder of Spain .


But , sir , when so long a time has elapsed , and no account is brought of either a victory or a battle , when they hear nothing but that our fleets have visited several neutral ports , and those of the enemy sailed unmolested from coast to coast , and when they are every day told of the losses of our merchants , are insulted in our own channel by the Spanish privateers , and receive no relations of our success upon the shores of our enemies , can it be wondered that they suspect the reality of our designs , or inquire whence it proceeds that their money has been wasted , their trade interrupted , and the liberty of their fellow-subjects invaded to no purpose ?


But how much more justly , sir , are they inflamed when they hear of the lucky stratagems , or daring enterprises of those enemies , which a just sense of their own superiority , had induced them to consider as vanquished before the battle , and of whom they had no apprehensions but that their cowardice would always secure them from vengeance ?
How justly may they murmur when they read , that our fleets leave every part of the enemy 's coast where their presence is necessary , and have afforded the Spaniards an opportunity of changing one port for another , as it is most convenient , and at length of joining the French squadrons , and sailing to the defence of their American dominions ?


May they not justly , sir , require of their representatives some reason for such inexplicable conduct ?
May they not reasonably demand an account of the arguments which procured their approbation of measures , which , so far as they can be examined by those who have no opportunity of perusing the necessary papers , appear either cowardly or treacherous ?


And what answer , sir , can we return to such remonstrances , unless this motion be agreed to ?
How can we appease the discontents of our constituents , or discharge the trust reposed in us , without a very minute and attentive inquiry into questions thus obscure and thus important ?


Are we to tell our constituents , that we absolutely rely upon the prudence and fidelity of the ministry and admirals , and recommend to them the same implicit dependence ?
Are we to confess that we have now for two sessions voted in the dark , and approved what we were not suffered to examine and understand ?


Such answers , sir , to questions so reasonable , will not contribute to increase the veneration of the people either for ourselves , or our constitution  and yet this answer , and this only , they can receive from us , if the papers mentioned in the motion I have made are denied .


Mr. CLUTTERBUCK replied in the following manner : -- Sir , this motion , though so warmly urged , and so artfully supported , I can consider only as a repetition of a former motion which was approved by the assembly , so far as it could properly be complied with , nor was any paper then concealed which it would not have been an injury to the nation to have divulged .


If the design of this motion be to promote the success of the present war , and the zeal with which it has been pressed , be incited only by the ardour of true patriotism , I doubt not but it will easily be withdrawn by those who are now most inclined to support it , when they shall reflect that it tends to the discovery of our schemes , and to the overthrow of our designs , that it will expose all our consultations to our enemies , and instruct them how to annoy us with most success , and how to shelter themselves from our intended attacks .


It is the first care , sir , of every administration , that their military designs should only be discovered by the execution of them , and that their enemies , by being obliged to guard all parts , should be weak in all .
If , by laying our papers before this house , the Spaniards should come to be informed against what part of their dominions our expeditions are designed , will they not increase their strength , improve their fortifications , and double their vigilance ?
And if we are thus obliged to form new schemes , must we not impute the defeat of the former to our own imprudent zeal , or unseasonable curiosity ?


Mr. SANDYS spoke to this effect : -- Sir , that we should demand the schemes laid for the future conduct of the war with Spain was never proposed , nor , as it may reasonably be concluded , ever imagined  for what is mentioned in the motion but the papers relating to the transactions of the two last years .


That it should be necessary to remind gentlemen of the difference between the future and the past , would hardly be suspected by any man not accustomed to senatorial controversies and artifices of state  and yet in the argument which has been offered against the motion , nothing has been asserted but that the orders relating to past transactions are not to be laid before us , lest the enemy should thereby gain intelligence of what we now design against them .


The necessity of secrecy in war needs not be urged , because it will not be denied  but when designs have been laid , and miscarried , the reasons of that miscarriage may surely be inquired , without danger of betraying the councils of our country .


If the negligence of our councils , and the misconduct of our commanders , has been such , that no designs have been premeditated  if a war has been carried on by chance , and nothing has succeeded , because nothing has been attempted  if our commanders have not done ill , and have only done nothing  if they have avoided loss by avoiding danger  we may surely inquire to whom such proceedings are to be imputed , whether the defeat of our designs is to be charged upon the strength of our enemy , or the cowardice of our officers  or whether the inactivity and apparent neutrality of our forces is occasioned by the negligence of our admirals , or the irresolution of our own ministry .


There have been , sir , many incidents in these two last years , of which the examination can be of very little advantage to the Spaniards .
I do not know what pernicious intelligence they can glean from an inquiry into the reasons for which Haddock 's fleet was divided , and Ogle sent to the defence of Minorca , or for which he afterwards returned .


Nor can I conceive that any advantage , except that of merriment and diversion , can be thrown into the hands of our enemies , though we should seriously inquire into what no man has yet pretended to understand , the wonderful escape of the Spanish squadron .
A transaction on which we had dwelt long enough with that admiration which ignorance produces , and on which it may not be improper at length to enable us to reason .


This is an affair , perhaps , much better understood by our enemies than by ourselves , and surely we can not , therefore , be afraid of informing them of it  at least since the fleet has long since sailed out , and left their coast , we can hardly be restrained in our inquiries by the fear of discovering our future designs .


If , therefore , it be the incontestable right of the senate to examine the conduct of publick affairs , which I suppose will scarcely be denied , this motion can not be rejected as unseasonable , nor can the papers be refused , without increasing those suspicions which are already too prevalent throughout the nation .


Nor , indeed , for our own sakes , ought we to delay this inquiry any longer , lest by having long acted without being accountable , the minister should form a prescription against our privilege , and , in time , tell us in plain terms that we are his slaves , and that we are not to presume to carry our examinations , however solemn and important they may continue to appear , farther than he shall be pleased to permit  and that , whatever may be the opinion of the people that deputes us , or , whatever ancient claims we may plead to authority , we are now to consider ourselves only as the oppressors of the nation , and the panegyrists of the court .


Mr. WALPOLE next rose , and spoke to this purpose : -- Sir , it can not be denied to be reasonable that all those papers should be laid before the senate , which can be communicated without injury to the publick .
Of this number we may justly imagine the orders sent to the admirals , in which the time of their departure is fixed , and many others which may be of use to inform the house , but can not enable the enemy to judge either of our force or our designs .


But it is evident , that there must be others included in this motion , which our regard for the success of the war , and the prosperity of our country , ought to determine us to conceal , and such as are never exposed by any administration  it is , therefore , proper to limit the address to papers of a certain kind , or a certain date , which may be considered by the house without benefit to our enemies , and for the examination of which a day or two will be more than sufficient .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke in substance as follows : -- Sir , I know not what number of papers the wisdom of the administration will allow us , but , if we judge by the time proposed to be spent in examination , we shall not be distracted with a great diversity of subjects  intelligence will be very penuriously dealt out , and if we submit to their choice of the writings which shall be laid before us , our inquiry will probably end without any discoveries made either by our enemies or ourselves .


But I hope , sir , we shall not be so cheaply satisfied , nor exposed by the fear of one enemy , to the insolence of another .
I hope we shall resolutely continue our demands of information , while a single line is concealed , from which any light can be expected .


There may , indeed , be circumstances in which our demands , however loud , will necessarily be vain .
It is not impossible that we may suspect those transactions of deep art , and secret contrivance , which have been the consequences of mere indolence , and want of consideration .
Our great ministers have been , perhaps , only doing nothing , while we have imagined that they were working out of sight .


Misled , sir , by this notion , we may call for the orders that have been despatched in these two last years , when , perhaps , our secretaries of state have been fattening on their salaries without employment , and have slept without care , and without curiosity , while we have been congratulating ourselves upon their vigilance for our preservation .


Or if orders have been given , it is to be considered , that the end of inspecting orders is to compare them with the conduct of the admirals to whom they were directed : from this comparison , I doubt not but many gentlemen expect uncommon discoveries  but to check all unreasonable hopes before they have taken possession of their hearts , for unreasonable hopes are the parent of disappointment , I think it proper to remind them , that to draw any conclusions from the orders , it is necessary to understand them .


This consideration alone is sufficient to redress the ardour of inquiry , for every man that has had opportunities of knowing the wonderful accomplishments of our ministry , the depth of their designs , the subtilty of their stratagems , and the closeness of their reasoning , will easily conceive it probable that they might send such orders as none but themselves could understand  and what then will be the consequence of our idle curiosity , but that we be led into a labyrinth of endless conjectures ?
For we have long ago found that no explanations are to be expected , and that our ministry are too wise to discover their secrets to their enemies .


Let us , therefore , examine the naked facts which have fallen within our observation , and endeavour to inform ourselves of the meaning of these secret orders by the execution of them .


Admiral Ogle was despatched from Haddock 's fleet to protect Minorca , and , in his absence , the Spanish squadron sailed away .
Perhaps he was ordered to watch Ferrol and Minorca at the same time , and not understanding how that was to be done , neglected one part of his charge , by an attention to the other : as a watchman who should be employed to guard at once the bank in London , and the treasury in Westminster .


Admiral NORRIS , sir , sailed lately forth , I suppose , in pursuance of orders , with a very formidable fleet , and after having lost sight for some days of the British coast , sailed back again with great precipitation .
Whether his orders were only to sail forth , or whether , when he examined them farther , he could not understand them , I pretend not to determine  but it may reasonably be imagined that his orders were of the same kind with those of our other admirals , because they produced the same consequences .


I have been told , that formerly our commanders were ordered to burn , sink , and destroy  and that in those times it was not uncommon for a British admiral to do much mischief with a strong fleet  but it is evident that the style is since changed , for our admirals are now very inoffensive , and go out only to come back .
I , therefore , think the motion highly necessary , and such as ought to be complied with .


Admiral NORRIS here rose up , and spoke thus : -- Sir , I am not conscious that my conduct in any part of my life has exposed me to be justly treated with contempt and ridicule , and what I have not deserved I will not bear .


If any gentleman in this house can accuse me of having neglected my duty , or deserted it , let him not spare insults or invectives , let him now expose my cowardice or my carelessness , let him prove me unworthy of trust or of command .


But my own conscience acquits me , and I defy any man to produce and support his accusation  nor can you , sir , [ Footnote : Addressing himself to Mr. PULTENEY . ]
who have thus contemptuously treated me , allege any thing against me that may justify your neglect of decency : that you have transgressed the rules of decency is the softest censure that your behaviour admits , and I think it may with equal propriety be asserted , that you have broken the laws of justice .


Mr. PULTENEY replied in this manner : -- Sir , I shall submit to you and all who hear me , whether I have treated the honourable gentleman 's name with any contemptuous freedom of speech .
The usual method of mentioning an expedition is that of naming the commander , who is not thereby necessarily included in the censure of an unsuccessful attempt , and I am very far from calling his courage and capacity into question .


Not that I shall ever think it necessary to make an apology for expressing my sentiments with freedom as a member of this house , in which I shall always speak what I think , and in what manner it shall appear to me most proper , nor shall I fear to repeat without doors what I say here .


Sir Robert WALPOLE next rose up , and spoke to this purpose : -- Sir , as I am not acquainted with any measures pursued by the administration , which it is their particular interest to conceal , I am desirous that all papers should be laid before the house which will not afford our enemies any opportunity of obviating our designs .


What necessity there is for this address I can not , indeed , discover , because I know not any foundation for suspicion of either negligence or treachery , which have been both insinuated in this debate .


Nor are the ministry , however ludicrously their abilities have been treated , afraid of discovering their ignorance , by laying before the house the orders which they have given to our admirals  orders of which they are far from doubting that they will appear , upon a candid examination , rational and proper .


The chief objection to this motion arises from its unreasonableness , and the necessity which it will produce of assigning to a fruitless inquiry those hours that may be more usefully employed .


Mr. PITT replied in terms to the effect following : -- Sir , it is my opinion , that our time can not be more usefully employed during a war , than in examining how it has been conducted , and settling the degree of confidence that may be reposed in those to whose care are intrusted our reputations , our fortunes , and our lives .


There is not any inquiry , sir , of more importance than this  it is not a question about an uncertain privilege , or a law , which , if found inconvenient , may hereafter be repealed  we are now to examine whether it is probable that we shall preserve our commerce and our independence , or whether we are sinking into subjection to a foreign power .


But this inquiry , sir , will produce no great information , if those , whose conduct is examined , are allowed to select the evidence .
For what accounts will they exhibit but such as have often already been laid before us , and such as they now offer without concern : accounts obscure and fallacious , imperfect and confused , from which nothing can be learned , and which can never entitle the minister to praise , though they may screen him from punishment .


Mr. PELHAM spoke as follows : -- Sir , I am confident that no man engaged in the administration desires to be screened from the most rigorous inquiry , or would defer to exhibit the papers a moment for any other reason than his regard for the publick .


I am confident , that nothing could so much contribute to advance the particular and distinct interest of the ministry as the publication of all the writings that relate to the present war , by which it would incontestably appear that nothing has been omitted that could promote our success , that our commanders have been sent out with orders to act with the utmost vigour , and that our preparations have been not disproportioned to the importance of our design .


It will appear that no former ministry have given greater proofs of their zeal for the publick interest , or have more steadily pursued the most proper measures by which it might be advanced .


I am not , indeed , certain that those who now call so loudly for information would be prevailed on by any degree of evidence to suspend their censures .
Them , who are now dissatisfied , I shall despair of influencing by reason or testimony  for they seem to inquire only to condemn  nor is this motion , perhaps , made so much for the sake of obtaining information , as of harassing the ministry with delays , and suspending affairs of greater importance .


This motion was agreed to , and upon another motion made by Mr. SANDYS , it was resolved ,


`` That an humble address be presented to his majesty , that he will be graciously pleased to give directions , that there may be laid before this house a copy of the reasons sent by admiral Cavendish , in pursuance of an order from the commissioners of the admiralty , which had retarded the sailing of admiral Ogle 's squadron , so much beyond expectation . ''


Likewise ,


`` That an humble address be presented to his majesty , that he will be graciously pleased to give directions , that there may be laid before this house a copy of the reasons transmitted by admiral Ogle , that did prevent him from sailing , pursuant to his repeated orders for that purpose , and particularly to those sent him by the commissioners of the admiralty . ''


HOUSE OF COMMONS , FEB. 3 , 1740-1 .


[ DEBATE REGARDING THE DEPARTURE OF THE FRENCH AND SPANISH SQUADRONS . ]


Mr. SANDYS this day presented a motion in writing , for petitioning his majesty to inform them when the regency received intelligence that the French and Spanish squadrons sailed , which was seconded , as follows , by Mr. WALLER : --


Sir , the information now moved for , appears to me so necessary in their deliberations on the conduct of the war , that without it we can only conjecture in the dark , and entangle ourselves in an inextricable labyrinth .


It is well known , that in war all motions are , in a great degree , to be regulated by those of the enemy , and that , therefore , no vigilance is to be spared by which any knowledge can be gained of their designs , nor any methods omitted of communicating them to those who have the direction of the war .


A ministry may , in conducting military operations , disappoint the expectations of their country , either by neglecting to procure intelligence , or by failing to make use of those opportunities which seasonable information puts into their power , and they may , when their designs fail of success , justify themselves , by proving that they were deceived by intelligence which it was reasonable to believe , or that better intelligence was not attainable , or that they made use , however unsuccessfully , of all the forces that could then be employed , and of all the advantages that were then in their possession .


But how shall we judge of our administration , how shall we know what confidence we ought to repose in their prudence and fidelity , and what miscarriages are to be attributed to the chance of war or superiour force of our enemies , if we can not be informed with what diligence they endeavour at information , and how early they have notice of the motions of the enemy ?


The sailing , or rather escape of the Ferrol squadron , and departure of the French fleet , are the most important events of the present war  events that threaten very dangerous consequences , no less than descents upon our American colonies , the conquest of our dominions , the slavery of our fellow-subjects , and perhaps the destruction of the brave Vernon , who is secure in the imagined vigilance of the other commanders , and may , perhaps , in a few days see himself surrounded by formidable squadrons of different nations , and exposed to the attack of forces to which his little fleet bears no proportion .


Nothing appears more evident , than that we had opportunities of observing , at least , all the preparations of the French , and of watching the moment of their departure , and that our force on the coast of Spain was sufficient to have confined their fleets for ever in their harbours , or to have destroyed them at their first entrance into the open seas , of which we may justly inquire , why it was not attempted , but shall inquire to no purpose till we know when they departed , that we may consider the state of our own forces , and whether our enemies escaped by our negligence , cowardice , or weakness .


Mr. WINNINGTON then spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , that we can not deliberate upon subjects which we do not understand , and that , therefore , no necessary or useful information ought to be denied to the house , I shall readily admit  but must observe , at the same time , that the reputation of the house would be very little consulted , in demanding information which can not be given .


To address his majesty to inform us of the time at which the squadrons of our enemies sailed , is to inquire of him what it ought to be the highest care of those princes to conceal from him , and which he can only know by having spies in their privy councils .


And of what importance is it to inquire what intelligence was brought him , or when he received it , if it appears that his intelligence must be in its own nature uncertain and dubitable ?


That they have left their ports is now certain , because they have been twice discovered in different parts of the world  but , as we can now only form conjectures on their designs and courses , so , before they sailed , it was impossible to know when they were fully equipped , or what time was fixed for their departure .
It is to be remembered , that they form their measures , and make their preparations in their own dominions , and therefore , have more advantages of concealing their schemes than we of discovering them .


Mr. Advocate CAMPBELL then spoke thus : -- Sir , this motion , which has been represented as unreasonable and absurd , is , in my opinion , not only proper , but important .


It is important , because it will enable us to judge , upon sufficient foundations , of the conduct of the ministry , who are censured by the voice of the nation , for having been either defective in vigilance or in activity , for having been either ignorant by their own fault of the designs of the enemy , or perfidiously passive in permitting the execution of them .


I am far from believing that such intelligence as our ministry is expected to procure , requires any uncommon subtilty , or any other agents than are always employed by every minister , to transmit to them informations from foreign courts .
Such , I am afraid , are always hovering about our consultations , and I know not why our ministers should be less diligent or less successful than those of other princes .


If , therefore , such intelligence might have been obtained , it was criminal not to obtain it  and if the departure of the Spanish squadron was foreseen , it ought to be inquired , why it was not prevented  and if it was only known when it was too late to hinder it from sailing , why it was not pursued , or why succours were not immediately despatched to admiral Vernon .


All these questions can only be resolved , in consequence of the information which his majesty shall give us  and for which it is , therefore , in my opinion , necessary to petition .


Mr. Henry PELHAM spoke next , to this purpose : -- Sir , how the regency could be informed of the intention of the Spaniards to leave their ports till it appeared by their departure , or by what means it can be expected that his majesty should be now acquainted with their particular course , or farther designs , I confess myself unable to conceive .


With regard , sir , to the intelligence transmitted from foreign courts by agents and spies , a little consideration will easily discover that it is not to be trusted .
For what can be generally expected from them , but that they should catch flying reports , or by chance intercept uncertain whispers , that they should inquire timorously , and , therefore , for the greatest part , of those from whom no satisfactory accounts can be received , and that they should often endeavour to deserve their salaries by such information as is rather pleasing than true .


All the knowledge that can be obtained of an enemy 's designs , must arise from a diligent comparison of one circumstance with another , and from a general view of his force , his interest , and his opportunities .
And that such conjectures will be often erroneous , needs not be told .


Probability , therefore , is , in such inquiries , all that can be attained , and he that sits idle in the time of war , expecting certain intelligence , will see his enemies enjoying the advantages of his folly , and laying hold on a thousand opportunities which he has neglected to improve .


The war in which we are now engaged , has been carried on by the administration with the utmost diligence and vigour  nor have any measures been omitted that could probably produce success , and the success of the wisest measures is only probable .


Should the great admiral , who is now present in the house , have met the French and Spaniards in the open seas , by what art could he arrive at a certain knowledge of their designs ?
He might by his acquaintance with the situation and state of neighbouring countries , the observation of their course , the periods of particular winds , and other hints of observation , form probable conjectures , but could never reach to certainty or confidence .


It seems to me , therefore , highly improper , to petition his majesty for intelligence which he can not be imagined to have received , and I can not agree to any motion for that purpose .


Mr. SANDYS then made another motion , to address his majesty , that there may be laid before the house copies of all letters received from , or written to , admiral Vernon since his going to the West Indies .
Which being seconded ,


Mr. PELHAM spoke to this effect : -- Sir , this motion , if the intention of it be limited by proper restrictions , is doubtless reasonable and just  for the right of this house to examine into the conduct of publick affairs , and , consequently , for calling for the papers necessary to enlighten their inquiries , is not to be disputed .


But , as the end of all such inquiries is the promotion of the publick welfare , so they are not to be made in a manner by which that end may be defeated .
Papers are not to be demanded , which can not be produced without discovering our own secrets , and acquainting our enemies either with that weakness which we ought carefully to conceal , or that force which will be most effectually employed if it is not known , and , therefore , no preparations are made to oppose it .


It can not be imagined , but that many of the papers which have passed between the admiralty and the commander in America , contain plans for the prosecution of the war , observations on the conditions of our own colonies , and , perhaps , intelligence of the estate of the Spanish fortresses and towns .
Many informations of the utmost consequence to our enemies may be collected from those papers , but nothing can be expected from them , that will enable us to prosecute a senatorial inquiry with more success , that will put it in our power to discover frauds , negligence , or treachery .


There are , sir , other papers which may , indeed , be laid before us , without any benefit to our enemies , and , perhaps , with some advantage to ourselves  the papers which contain the accompts of our preparations and stores , the lists of our forces , and the calculation of our expenses , are the proper subjects of senatorial inquiries  and if the motion be restrained to those , I believe it will not be opposed by any gentleman engaged in the administration of our affairs .
I shall beg leave to propose these words may be added , `` So far as the same relates to a supply of ships , marines , or land forces . ''


The motion , thus amended , was agreed to .


HOUSE OF LORDS , FEB. 13 , 1740-1 .


DEBATE ON ADDRESSING HIS MAJESTY FOR REMOVING SIR ROBERT WALPOLE .


The opposition which for a long time had been made in the commons , to the measures of the administration , was on this day pushed to a crisis , and produced a motion in both houses .
In the house of lords it occasioned the following debate :


Lord CARTERET began in this manner : -- My lords , as the motion which I am about to make is of the highest importance , and of the most extensive consequences  as it can not but meet with all the opposition which the prejudices of some , and the interest of others , can raise against it  as it must have the whole force of ministerial influence to encounter , without any assistance but from justice and reason  I hope to be excused by your lordships for spending some time in endeavouring to show , that it wants no other support , that it is not founded upon doubtful suspicions , but upon uncontestable facts  that it is not dictated by private interest , but by the sincerest regard to publick happiness  not abetted by the personal malevolence of particular men , but enforced by the voice of the people  a voice which ought always to be attended to , and , generally , to be obeyed .


To endeavour , my lords , to remove from places of publick trust all those who appear to want either the virtues or abilities necessary for executing their offices , is the interest of every member of a community .
And it is not only the interest but the duty of all those who are , either by the choice of the people , or by the right of birth , invested with the power of inspecting publick affairs , and intrusted with the general happiness of their country .
That , therefore , every motive combines to make it the duty , and every argument concurs to prove it the privilege of your lordships , is too evident to be doubted .


How often this privilege has been exerted by this house , and how often it has rescued our country from oppression , insolence , and rapine  how often our constitution has been reanimated , and impending ruin been averted by it , a superficial acquaintance with history may inform us .
And we are now called upon by the universal cry of the nation , and urged by the perplexed and uncertain state of our foreign affairs , and declension of our wealth , and attacks upon our liberties at home , to recollect these precedents of magnanimity and justice , and to make another effort for the relief of our country .


This house , my lords , has proceeded against ministers , whose conduct they disapproved , by methods of greater or less severity , according to the necessity of affairs , or the supposed malignity of the crimes alleged against them  and , therefore , have sometimes thought it necessary to deter posterity from imitating them by rigorous censures , and exemplary punishments , and sometimes have thought it sufficient to set the nation free from its distresses , without inflicting any penalties on those by whose misconduct they imagined them produced .


What were the more violent and vindictive methods of proceeding , it is not necessary , with regard to this motion , to examine  since I shall only propose , that we should , in imitation of our predecessors , in cases of this nature , humbly address his majesty to remove the minister from his presence and councils .


Nothing , my lords , can be more moderate or tender than such an address , by which no punishment is inflicted , nor any forfeiture exacted .
The minister , if he be innocent , if his misconduct be only the consequence of his ignorance or incapacity , may lay down in peace an office for which nature has not designed him , enjoy the vast profits of long employment in tranquillity , and escape the resentment of an unhappy people  who , when irritated to the highest degree , by a continuation of the same miscarriages , may , perhaps , in the heat of a more malevolent prosecution , not sufficiently distinguish between inability and guilt .


Those , therefore , among your lordships , that think him honest but mistaken , must willingly agree to a motion like this , as the best expedient to appease the people without the ruin of the minister .
For surely no man who has read the history , or is acquainted with the temper of this nation , can expect that the people will always bear to see honours , favours , and preferments , distributed by the direction of one universally suspected of corruption , and arbitrary measures  or will look only with silent envy upon the affluence of those whom they believe to be made great by fraud and plunder , swelled to insolence by the prosperity of guilt , and advanced to wealth and luxury by publick miseries .


Such of your lordships who join with the people in ascribing our present unhappy state not to the errours , but to the crimes of the minister , and who , therefore , think a bare removal not sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice , must , doubtless , give their consent to the motion , for the sake of obtaining proper evidence of his wickedness , which can not be expected while he stands exalted in prosperity , and distributes the riches of the nation , and the gifts of his sovereign at his own choice  while he is in possession of every motive that can influence the mind , enforce secrecy , and confirm fidelity  while he can bribe the avaricious , and intimidate the fearful  while he can increase the gratification of luxury , and enlarge the prospects of ambition .
For , my lords , if it be considered from whom this evidence must be drawn , it will soon appear that no very important discoveries can be made , but by those whom he has intrusted with his secrets , men whose disregard of virtue recommended them to his favour , and who , as they are moved only by interest , will continue faithful while they can hope for recompense  but may , perhaps , be willing to buy their own security by sacrificing their master , when they shall see no farther prospect of advantage from serving him , or any other method of escaping punishment .


But , my lords , all must allow this motion to be reasonable , whatever they think of the minister 's conduct , who are of opinion that a free people have a right of complaining when they feel oppression , and of addressing the crown to remove a minister that has incurred their universal detestation .
That such is the condition of the present minister , I believe , will scarcely be denied , or may be discovered by those who find themselves inclined to doubt it , by asking any man whom they shall accidentally meet , what are his sentiments on the situation of national affairs , and of the hands by which they are administered .
What answer he will receive is well known to most of your lordships .
Let him not be satisfied with a single suffrage , let him repeat the question to ten thousand persons , different in their ages , their conditions , and religious opinions , in every thing that produces contrariety of dispositions and affections , he will yet find them unanimous in complaining of publick misconduct , and in censuring one gentleman as the author of it .


Let us not imagine , my lords , that these accusations and murmurs are confined to the lowest class of the people , to men whose constant attention to more immediate distresses , hinder them from making excursions beyond their own employments .
For though , perhaps , it might be made evident from the accounts of past times , that no general dissatisfaction , even among men of this rank , was ever groundless  though it might be urged that those who see little can only clamour , because they feel themselves oppressed  and though it might not unseasonably be hinted that they are at least formidable for their numbers , and have , sometimes , executed that justice which they had not interest to procure , and trampled upon that insolence that has dared to defy them  yet I shall not insist upon such motives , because it is notorious that discontent is epidemical in all ranks , and that condition and observation are far from appeasing it .


Whether the discontent , thus general , is groundless , whether it is raised only by the false insinuations of the disappointed , and the wicked arts of the envious , whether it is , in exception to all the maxims of government , the first dislike of an administration that ever overspread a nation without just reasons , deserves to be inquired into .


In this inquiry , my lords , it will be necessary to consider not only the state of domestick affairs , increase or diminution of our debts , the security or violation of our liberties , the freedom or dependence of our senates , and the prosperity or declension of our trade , but to examine the state of this nation , with regard to foreign powers  to inquire , whether we are equally feared and equally trusted now as in former administrations  whether our alliances have contributed to secure us from our inveterate and habitual enemies , or to expose us to them  whether the balance of Europe be still in our hands  and whether , during this long interval of peace , our power has increased in the same proportion with that of our neighbours .
France , my lords , is the constant and hereditary enemy of Britons , so much divided from her in religion , government , and interest , that they can not both be prosperous together  as the influence of one rises , that of the other must , by consequence , decline .
Alliances may form a temporal show of friendship , but it can not continue  for their situation produces a natural rivalship , which every accidental circumstance has contributed to increase .
Long wars , for many reigns after the conquest , established a radical and insuperable hatred between us , nor did those wars cease till the reformation produced new occasions of jealousy and aversion .
France was , by these reasons , obliged for many ages to employ all her influence and policy in strengthening herself against us , by treaties and alliances  and in our times , has given us a new reason for jealousy by extending her commerce , and improving her manufactures .


It has been , therefore , my lords , the settled principle of every wise administration , of every Briton , whose opinions were not regulated by some other motives than those of reason , to attend , with the highest degree of vigilance , to all the designs of the French , and oppose , with incessant diligence , every attempt to increase their force , or extend their influence , and to check their conquests , obstruct their alliances , and forestal their trade .


For this great end it has been our constant endeavour to support the Austrian family , whose large dominions and numerous forces make a counterbalance on the continent to the power of France .
For this end we entered into a long war , of which we still languish under the consequences , squandered the lives of our countrymen , and mortgaged the possessions of our posterity .
For failing in the prosecution of this purpose , for leaving France too formidable , and neglecting the interests of the emperour , was the treaty of Utrecht censured , and the authors of it prosecuted by the present minister  but how much he has improved the errours of his predecessors to his own advantage , how diligent he has been to rectify the miscarriages of their conduct , and supply the defect , I shall endeavour to explain .


It is well known , my lords , that during the regency of the duke of Orleans , we had nothing to apprehend from French machinations  his interest , a tie which that nation is seldom found to break , held him steady to his engagements with us  nor is it less known how much he distrusted Spain , and how little , by consequence , he favoured her .
We had , at that time , no necessity of anxiously attending to every whisper of the French court , which was sufficiently engaged in regulating their domestick affairs , and repairing the ruins of a destructive war  but , my lords , we ought to observe , that it had been happy for us had our minister laboured with equal address at the same employment .


After the death of this duke , the affairs of France were restored to their former situation , her old schemes were revived , her ancient alliances cultivated , and her general interest pursued .
Spain was again considered as the power which had the same views with her , and which could never rival , but might always assist her .


This alliance , my lords , was intended to have been unalterably confirmed by a marriage , but as no human policy can form measures certain of success , an irreconcilable hatred was nearly produced by the measure intended to confirm a settled and indissoluble friendship .
The infanta was sent back after her arrival in France , an affront which no nation would soon have forgot , but which the general character and habitual sentiments of the Spaniards inclined them to resent beyond any other people .
To any one acquainted with their character in this respect , it will readily appear , that no other insult or injury could so sensibly affect them , or excite so eager a desire of revenge , This , my lords , the sagacity of our minister should have discovered , this opportunity should have been improved with the utmost care , by which Spain and France might possibly have been disunited for ages , and Britain have gained such advantages as would have made her the sole arbitress of Europe .


The Spaniards were not deficient on their side , nor did they neglect to court our friendship , but gave us the highest proof of their confidence by offering us the sole mediation of their differences with the emperour of Germany : but at this time it was , that the gentleman whose conduct I am examining , obtained the chief influence in our councils , and by his peculiar penetration discovered , that nothing was to be done which might give the least offence to the French .
We , therefore , refused to mediate , unless French ministers might be associated with ours , which the Spaniards had too much spirit to consent to .


Thus , my lords , was neglected the first opportunity of forming against the French an alliance by which they might have been awed in all their designs , and by which the peace of Europe might have been long preserved .


The Spaniards , finding that we would not undertake to reconcile their differences with the emperour of Germany , and continuing their abhorrence of French mediators , concluded , without the intervention of any other power , a treaty both of peace and alliance with his imperial majesty .


This , my lords , was the famous treaty of Vienna , the source of so many projects and expedients , of so much terrour and solicitude , of such immense expenses , and perplexed negotiations .
This treaty , a paper innocent and well-meaning , which related only to the contracting parties , kept , for some time , this nation in alarms , in apprehensions of conspiracies , and expectations of invasions .


To this treaty , had we singly regarded our own affairs , without applying to France for instructions , we ought to have acceded , by which we should have divided the interest of the house of Bourbon , broken the combination of these pontifical powers , and , by improving one lucky incident , obtained what our arms and our politicks had never , hitherto , been able to accomplish .


But the French , sensible of their danger , and well acquainted with our minister , contrived an expedient which , indeed , would not often have succeeded , but which was so well adapted to the intellects of this gentleman , that it extricated them from all their difficulties .


They told us , my lords , and , what is yet more wonderful , they prevailed upon us to believe , that in this dreadful treaty of Vienna , it was stipulated between the German emperour and Spain , that they should employ their joint forces against Britain , that they should exalt the pretender to the throne , take immediate possession of Gibraltar , and , without mercy , debar us for ever from our trade both in Spain and in the Western Indies .
This his late majesty was advised to assert in his speech from the throne , which I desire may be read .


Of which the following clauses were read :


`` My lords and gentlemen ,


`` The distressed condition of some of our religious brethren abroad , and the negotiations and engagements entered into by some foreign powers , which seem to have laid the foundation of new troubles and disturbances in Europe , and to threaten my subjects with the loss of several of the most advantageous branches of their trade , obliged me , without any loss of time , to concert with other powers such measures as might give a check to the ambitious views of those who are endeavouring to render themselves formidable , and put a stop to the farther progress of such dangerous designs .
For these ends I have entered into a defensive alliance with the French king , and the king of Prussia , to which several other powers , and particularly the Dutch , have been invited to accede , and I have not the least reason to doubt of their concurrence .
This treaty shall , in a short time , be laid before you .


`` By these means , and by your support and assistance , I trust in God , I shall be able not only to secure to my own subjects the enjoyment of many valuable rights and privileges , long since acquired for them by the most solemn treaties , but effectually to preserve the peace and balance of Europe , the only view and end of all my endeavours .


`` It is not to be doubted , but the enemies to my government will conceive hopes , that some favourable opportunity for renewing their attempts may offer , from the prospect of new troubles and commotions : they are already very busy by their instruments and emissaries in those courts whose measures seem most to favour their purposes , in soliciting and promoting the cause of the pretender  but I persuade myself , notwithstanding the countenance and encouragement they may have received , or flatter themselves with , the provision you shall make for the safety and defence of the empire , will effectually secure me from any attempts from abroad , and render all such projects vain and abortive .


`` When the world shall see that you will not suffer the British crown and nation to be menaced and insulted , those who most envy the present happiness and tranquillity of this empire , and are endeavouring to make us subservient to their ambition , will consider their own interest and circumstances before they make any attempt upon so brave a people , strengthened and supported by prudent and powerful alliances , and though desirous to preserve the peace , able and ready to defend themselves against the efforts of all aggressors .
Such resolutions and such measures , timely taken , I am satisfied , are the most effectual means of preventing a war , and continuing to us the blessings of peace and prosperity . ''


Who would not have been terrified , my lords , at a treaty like this ?
Our religion was to be destroyed , our government subverted , and our trade reduced to nothing .
What could a ministry , thus intimidated , do , but resign themselves implicitly to the direction of a kind neighbour , that promised to shelter them from the storm ?


There have been ministers , my lords , in former times , who , upon hearing such a representation , would have considered , that Britain was an island , that the pretender could not be forced upon us without an army , and that an army could not be transported without ships , that the emperour of Germany had neither navies nor ports , that Gibraltar might be easily supplied with every thing requisite for its defence , and that any attempt made by Spain to injure our trade , might easily be punished by intercepting their Plate fleets .


They would then have considered whether attempts so improbable , and stipulations so absurd and ridiculous , ought to be credited upon the information of an ambassadour 's secretary , who , as he proposed to reveal his master 's secrets for a bribe , might as probably take another reward for imposing upon those whom he pretended to inform .
Those , therefore , who advised his majesty to assert to the senate what they knew from no better authority , those whose daring insolence could make their sovereign instrumental in alarming the people with false terrours , and oppressing them with unnecessary burdens , well deserve to feel a senatorial censure .


But our ministers , my lords , were too much frighted to make such reflections : they imagined that destruction was hanging over us , and , in a dread of arbitrary government , oppression , and persecution , concluded at Hanover a treaty with the French .


Thus the French gained our confidence , and raised in us a distrust of both the powers with whom it was our interest to be united : but the alliance of the emperour of Germany with Spain made them still uneasy  and , therefore , they determined , once more , to make our credulity instrumental in procuring a reconciliation between them and the Spaniards .


To effect this , they kindly gave us intelligence , that when the Spaniards should receive their treasures from the Western Indies , they designed to employ it in favour of the pretender , and that , therefore , it was necessary to intercept it .
This advice was thankfully listened to , a fleet was fitted out , and thousands were sacrificed without any advantage  for the French not only forbore to assist us in the expedition , but forbade us to seize the treasure when we had found it .


The Spaniards , apprehending themselves attacked , omitted no opportunity of showing their resentment  they seized our ships , and laid siege to Gibraltar , while our new allies looked quietly on , and expected the event of their own scheme , which was far from being defeated by our policy  for the Spaniards , finding the return of their American revenues insuperably obstructed , and knowing that the emperour of Germany , that emperour who was to invade Britain , had not any power even to assist them , were obliged to have recourse to the nation which they then hated , and to forgive the past affront , that they might obtain their good offices in this exigence .


But , my lords , it was not sufficient for the designs of the French , that they had recovered their ancient allies the Spaniards , unless they could disunite them from the emperour of Germany : this it was , likewise , our interest to prevent , and yet this , likewise , we enabled them to effect  for they prevailed upon us to promise , in our stipulations with the Spaniards , what they had not the least claim to demand , that Spain , instead of neutral troops , should be introduced into Italy , to secure certain successions there to a son of the queen of Spain .


With what reluctance the emperour of Germany would consent to see troops placed in the provinces bordering upon his dominions , which would certainly , on the first occasion , be employed to invade them , it was easy to foresee , and with what degree of good-will he would regard those by whom they were introduced  yet , my lords , such was the influence of France , and so ardent our desire of diverting Spain from setting the pretender upon the throne of Britain , that we complied at all events , without any prospect or promise of advantage .


Thus were the Spaniards , by being persuaded to make this demand , and we , by granting it , brought equally to ill terms with the emperour of Germany  and France was , by procuring such agreeable conditions to the Spaniards , again considered as their most useful ally .


That nation , my lords , is in a very unhappy state , which is reduced to admit such terms as mediators are pleased to prescribe .
We durst not refuse the introduction of Spanish troops , nor durst we introduce them without the emperour of Germany 's consent , which , however , he granted at an easy rate , for he demanded only that we should become guarantees of the Pragmatick sanction .
This we gladly agreed to , and thought ourselves so happy in purchasing , so cheaply , an opportunity of ingratiating ourselves with Spain , that we desired no other recompense .


This treaty with the emperour of Germany , was , however , by no means improper , nor could we , after the errours which had been committed , do any thing more effectual to preserve the balance of Europe , and reestablish our credit .


But , my lords , this only treaty , which it was for our interest to make , seems to have been made without any intention of observing it  for about this time all the northern powers were alarmed by the approaching election of Poland , and every nation that had any thing either to hope or fear from the event of it , endeavoured to influence it .


How this election was determined , my lords , and by what means , it is unnecessary to relate  but it may not be improper to remark , that whatever cause we may have to congratulate ourselves upon the choice , it does not appear that we had any part in promoting it .
Nay , as it is not common for ministers to keep the best part of their conduct secret , there is reason for suspecting that they were not altogether without foundation reported to have favoured France .


The emperour of Germany , sensible of his own interest , promoted the election with vigour and resolution , proportioned to the greatness of the danger that might have arisen from neglecting it .
By this conduct he drew upon himself the resentment of the French , who had now a pretence for taking measures which might effectually reunite them to Spain , and , as the event showed , alienate us from the emperour , and , therefore , in vindication of the claim of Stanislaus , declared war upon Germany , in conjunction with Spain .


Now , my lords , the emperour learned to set the true value upon his alliance with Britain , and all Europe had an opportunity of remarking our spirit , our power , and our vigilance .
The troops which we prevailed upon his imperial majesty to admit into Italy , were now drawn out of the garrisons against him , his dominions were attacked on each side , by formidable enemies , and his British allies looked with tranquillity and unconcern upon the difficulties into which they had betrayed him .
The liberties of Europe were endangered by a new combination of the houses of Bourbon  and Britain , the great protectress of the rights of mankind , the great arbitress of the balance of power , either neglected or feared to interpose .


Of the event of the war , my lords , I need only observe , that it added new strength to France , and contributed to such an union between her and Spain , as the most artful politician can not hope to dissolve .


Thus , my lords , whether by negligence , ignorance , cowardice , or treachery , it is not easy to determine , we were made the instruments of the French policy .
Thus was that power enabled by our assistance to retrieve all that she had lost by the ill success of her arms , and by her indecent and contemptuous treatment of Spain .
Thus was the German emperour dispirited and weakened  thus were we deprived at once of our allies and our reputation .


Our loss of reputation , the greatest loss that bad measures can bring upon a nation , is made evident beyond controversy , by the insolence with which the Spaniards have treated us while we were flattering , enriching , and supporting them .
While we were fitting out squadrons to convey their princes to Italy , and increasing their dominions at our own expense , they seem to have considered our good offices , not as the benefits of friends , but the drudgery of slaves , and , therefore , could scarcely refrain from insults while they employed us , at least when they no longer wanted our immediate assistance .
They renewed their contempt and cruelty , their robberies and oppressions  they prescribed laws to our navigation , and laid claim to our colonies .


To these ravages and injuries what did we oppose ?
What but humble intreaties , pacifick negotiations , and idle remonstrances ?
Instead of asserting our just claims , and incontestable possessions , instead of preventing war by threatening it , and securing ourselves from a second injury by punishing the first , we amused ourselves with inquiries , demands , representations , and disputes , till we became the jest of that nation which it was in our power to distress , by intercepting their treasure , and to reduce to terms almost without bloodshed .


Thus , my lords , did we proceed , new questions ever arose , and the controversy became more intricate  commissaries were despatched to Spain , who returned without obtaining either restitution or security , and in the mean time no opportunity was neglected of plundering our merchants , and insulting our flag : accounts of new confiscations and of new cruelties daily arrived , the nation was enraged , and the senate itself alarmed , and our ministers , at length awakened from their tranquillity , sent orders to the envoy at the Spanish court to expedite an accommodation  these directions were immediately obeyed , and produced the celebrated convention .


What was given up , or what was endangered by this detestable treaty , your lordships have often had occasion to observe , and the consequences of it were so obvious , that the nation was astonished .
Every man saw that we were either treacherously betrayed by our own ministry , or that the ministers were almost the only men in the kingdom utterly unacquainted with our claims , our injuries , and our danger .


A war could now no longer be avoided , it was not in the power of the ministry any longer to refuse to send out our fleets , and make an appearance of hostile measures  but they had still some expedients remaining to shelter the Spaniards from our resentment , and to make their country yet more contemptible : they could contrive such orders for their admirals as should prevent them from destroying their enemies with too little mercy  and if any one was suspected of intentions less pacifick , there were methods of equipping his fleet in such a manner as would effectually frustrate his schemes of revenge , reprisals , and destruction .


These , my lords , are not the murmurs of the disappointed , nor the insinuations of the factious  it is well known to our countrymen and to our enemies , how ill admiral Vernon was furnished with naval and military stores , and how little his importunate demands of a supply were regarded .
What opportunities were lost , and what advantages neglected , may be conjectured from the success of his inconsiderable force .
A very little reflection on the situation and state of those countries will easily satisfy your lordships , how far a small body of land-forces might have penetrated , what treasures they might have gained , and what consternation they might have spread over the whole Spanish America .


That our squadrons in the Mediterranean have been , at least , useless , that they have sailed from point to point , and from one coast to another , only to display the bulk of our ships , and to show the opulence of our nation , can require no proof : I wish , my lords , there was less reason for suspecting that they acted in concert with our enemies , that they retired from before their ports only to give them an opportunity of escaping , and that they , in reality , connived at some attempts which they were , in appearance , sent to prevent .


There are some miscarriages in war , my lords , which every reasonable man imputes to chance , or to causes of which the influence could not be foreseen  there are others that may justly be termed the consequences of misconduct , but of misconduct involuntary and pardonable , of a disregard , perhaps , of some circumstances of an affair produced by too close an attention to others .
But there are miscarriages , too , for which candour itself can find no excuses , and of which no other causes can be assigned than cowardice or treachery .
From the suspicion of one , the past actions of the admiral who commands our fleet in those seas will secure him , but I know not whether there are now any that will attempt to clear the minister 's character from the imputation of the other .


All the insolence of the Spaniards , a nation by no means formidable , is the consequence of the reunion of the houses of Bourbon  a reunion which could not easily have been accomplished , but by the instrumental offices of our ministry , whom , therefore , the nation has a right to charge with the diminution of its honour , and the decay of its trade .


Nor has our trade , my lords , been only contracted and obstructed by the piracies of Spain , but has been suffered to languish and decline at home , either by criminal negligence , or by their complaisance for France , which has given rise to our other calamities .
The state of our woollen manufactures is well known , and those whose indolence or love of pleasure keeps them strangers to the other misfortunes of their country , must yet have been acquainted with this , by the daily accounts of riots and insurrections , raised by those who , having been employed in that manufacture , can provide for their families by no other business , and are made desperate by the want of bread .


We are told , my lords , by all parties , and told with truth , that our manufactures decline , because the French have engrossed most of the foreign markets  and it is not denied even by those whose interest it might be to ' deny it , that the cloth which they ruin us by vending , is made of our own wool , which they are suffered to procure either by the folly of an unskilful , or the connivance of a treacherous administration .


If our own manufactures , my lords , had been carefully promoted , if the whole influence of our government had been made to cooperate with the industry of our traders , there had always been such a demand for our wool , that they could not have afforded to purchase it at a price equivalent to the danger of exporting it : and if any means were now steadily practised to prevent the exportation , our trade must consequently revive , because cloth is one of the necessaries of life which other nations must have from Britain , when France can no longer supply them .


But , my lords , notwithstanding the decay of trade , our expenses have never been contracted  we have squandered millions in idle preparations , and ostentatious folly  we have equipped fleets which never left the harbour , and raised armies which were never to behold any other enemy than the honest traders and husbandmen that support them .
We have , indeed , heard many reasons alleged for oppressing the empire with standing troops , which can have little effect upon those who have no interest to promote by admitting them : sometimes we are in danger of invasions , though it is not easy to imagine for what purpose any prince should invade a nation , which he may plunder at pleasure , without the least apprehension of resentment , and which will resign any of its rights whenever they shall be demanded : sometimes , as we have already heard , the pretender is to be set upon the throne by a sudden descent of armies from the clouds  and sometimes the licentiousness and disobedience of the common people requires the restraint of a standing army .


That the people are , to the last degree , exasperated and inflamed , I am far from intending to deny , but surely they have yet been guilty of no outrage so enormous as to justify so severe a punishment  they have generally confined themselves to harmless complaints , or , at least , to executions in effigy .
The people , my lords , are enraged because they are impoverished , and , to prevent the consequences of their anger , their poverty is increased by new burdens , and aggravated by the sight of an useless , despicable herd , supported by their industry , for no other purpose than to insult them .


By these useless armaments and military farces , our taxes , my lords , have been continued without diminishing our debts , and the nation seems condemned to languish for ever under its present miseries , which , by furnishing employment to a boundless number of commissioners , officers , and slaves , to the court , under a thousand denominations , by diffusing dependence over the whole country , and enlarging the influence of the crown , are too evidently of use to the minister for us to entertain any hopes of his intention to relieve us .


Let it not be boasted that nine millions are paid , when a new debt of seven millions appears to be contracted  nothing is more easy than to clear debts by borrowing , or to borrow when a nation is mortgaged for the payment .


But the weight of the present taxes , my lords , though heavier than was perhaps ever supported by any nation for so long a time , taxes greater than ever were paid , to purchase neither conquests nor honours , neither to prevent invasions from abroad , nor to quell rebellions at home , is not the most flagrant charge of this wonderful administration , which , not contented with most exorbitant exactions , contrives to make them yet more oppressive by tyrannical methods of collection .
With what reason the author of the excise scheme dreads the resentment of the nation is sufficiently obvious  but surely , in a virtuous and benevolent mind , the first sentiments that would have arisen on that occasion , would not have been motions of anger , but of gratitude .
A whole nation was condemned to slavery , their remonstrances were neglected , their petitions ridiculed , and their detestation of tyranny treated as disaffection to the established government  and yet the author of this horrid scheme riots in affluence , and triumphs in authority , and without fear , as without shame , lifts up his head with confidence and security .


How much , my lords , is the forbearance of that people to be admired , whom such attacks as these have not provoked to transgress the bounds of their obedience , who have continued patiently to hope for legal methods of redress , at a time when they saw themselves threatened with legal slavery , when they saw the legislative power established only for their protection , influenced by all possible methods of corruption to betray them to the mercy of the ministry ?


For , that corruption has found its way into one of the houses of the legislature , is universally believed , and , without scruple , maintained by every man in the nation , who is not evidently restrained from speaking as he thinks  and that any man can even be of a different opinion , that any man can even affirm that he thinks otherwise , would be , in any other age , the subject of astonishment .
That an immense revenue is divided among the members of the other house , by known salaries and publick employments , is apparent  that large sums are privately scattered on pressing exigencies , that some late transactions of the ministry were not confirmed but at a high price , the present condition of the civil list , a civil list vastly superiour to all the known expenses of the crown , makes highly probable .
That the commons themselves suspect the determinations of their assembly to be influenced by some other motives than justice and truth , is evident from the bill this day sent hither for our concurrence  and , surely , no aggravation can be added to the crimes of that man who has patronised our enemies , and given up our navigation , sunk his country into contempt abroad , and into poverty at home , plundered the people , and corrupted the legislature .


But , my lords , the minister has not only contributed , by his wickedness or his ignorance , to the present calamities , but has applied all his art and all his interest to remove from posts of honour and trust , to banish from the court , and to exclude from the legislature all those whose counsels might contribute to restore the publick affairs , without any regard to the popularity of their characters , the usefulness of their talents , or the importance of their past services to the crown .
Had any of these considerations prevailed , we had not seen the greatest general in Britain dispossessed of all his preferments , dispossessed at a time when we are at war with one nation , and in expectation of being attacked by another far more powerful , which will , doubtless , be encouraged , by his removal , to more daring contempt , and more vigorous measures .


What were the motives of this procedure it is easy to discover .
As his open defence of the present royal family in the late rebellion , exempts him from the imputation of being disaffected to the crown , the only crime with which he can be charged is disaffection to the minister .


Perhaps , my lords , the minister may have determined to have no need of generals in his transactions with foreign powers  but in proportion as he relies less upon the sword , he must depend more upon the arts of peaceable negotiation , and , surely , there has been another person dismissed from his employments , whose counsels it had been no reproach to have asked , and to have followed .


The nature of my motion , my lords , makes it not necessary to produce evidence of these facts , it is sufficient that any minister is universally suspected  for when did an innocent man , supported by power , and furnished with every advantage that could contribute to exalt or preserve his character , incur the general hatred of the people ?
But if it could ever happen by a combination of unlucky accidents , what could be more for the happiness of himself , his master , and the nation , than that he should retire and enjoy the consciousness of his own virtue .


His own interest , in such a retirement , I have already considered , and that both of the prince and the people is no less apparent : while a hated minister is employed , the king will always be distrusted by the nation , and , surely , nothing can so much obstruct the publick happiness , as a want of confidence in those who are intrusted with its preservation .


That common fame is , in this case , sufficient , will not be questioned , when it is considered that common fame is never without a foundation in facts , that it may spread disquiet and suspicion over all the kingdom , and that the satisfaction of millions is very cheaply purchased by the degradation of one man , who was exalted only for their benefit .


The objection , that there is no sole minister , will create no greater difficulty  if there be many concerned in these transactions , respondeat superior : but it is too apparent that there is , in reality , one whose influence is greater than that of any other private man , and who is arrived at a height not consistent with the nature of the British government  it is uncontested that there is one man to whom the people impute their miseries , and by whose removal they will be appeased .


The affairs of Europe , my lords , will probably be so much embarrassed , and the struggles between the different designs of its princes be so violent , that they will demand all our attention , and employ all our address , and it will be to the highest degree dangerous to be distracted at the same time with apprehensions of domestick troubles  yet , such is the present unhappy state of this nation , and such is the general discontent of the people , that tranquillity , adherence to the government , and submission to the laws , can not reasonably be hoped , unless the motion I shall now take leave to make your lordships , be complied with : and I move , `` That an humble address be presented to his majesty , most humbly to advise and beseech his majesty , that he will be most graciously pleased to remove the right honourable sir Robert WALPOLE , knight of the most noble order of the blue riband , first commissioner of his majesty 's treasury , and chancellor of the exchequer , and one of his majesty 's most honourable privy council , from his majesty 's presence and councils for ever . ''


He was seconded by lord ABINGDON in the following manner : -- My lords , the copiousness and perspicuity with which the noble lord has laid down the reasons of his motion , make it neither easy nor necessary to enlarge upon them .
I shall , therefore , only offer to your lordships a few thoughts upon the authority of common fame , as the evidence upon which the motion is in part founded .


That all the miscarriages of our late measures are by common fame imputed to one man , I suppose , will not be denied  nor can it , in my opinion , be reasonably required , that in the present circumstances of things any other proof should be brought against him .


Common fame , my lords , is admitted in courts of law as a kind of auxiliary or supplemental evidence , and is allowed to corroborate the cause which it appears to favour .
The general regard which every wise man has for his character , is a proof that in the estimation of all mankind , the testimony of common fame is of too great importance to be disregarded .


If we consider the nature of popular opinions on publick affairs , it will be difficult to imagine by what means a persuasion not founded on truth should universally take possession of a people  it will be yet more difficult to believe that it should preserve its empire , and that in opposition to every art that can be made use of to undeceive them , they should pertinaciously adhere to an errour not imbibed in their education , nor connected with their interest .
And how has any man been originally prejudiced against the present minister ?
Or what passion or interest can any man gratify , by imagining or declaring his country on the verge of ruin ?
The multitude , my lords , censure and praise without dissimulation , nor were ever accused of disguising their sentiments  their voice is , at least , the voice of honesty , and has been termed the voice of heaven , by that party of which those affect to be thought whom it now condemns .


Let it not be urged , that the people are easily deceived , that they think and speak merely by caprice , and applaud or condemn without any calm inquiry or settled determination  these censures are applicable only to sudden tumults , and gusts of zeal excited by fallacious appearances , or by the alarms of a false report industriously disseminated , but have no relation to opinions gradually propagated , and slowly received .


If the credulity of the people exposes them to so easy an admission of every report , why have the writers for the minister found so little credit ?
Why have all the loud declamations , and the laboured arguments , the artful insinuations , and positive assertions , which have been for many years circulated round the nation , at the expense of the government , produced no effect upon the people , nor convinced any man , who was not apparently bribed , to resign his private opinion to that of his patrons ?
Whence comes it , my lords , that falsehood is more successful than truth , and that the nation is inclined to complain rather than to triumph ?
It is well known that the people have been charged in all former ages , with being too much dazzled by the glitter of fortune , and the splendour of success , and bestowing their applauses not according to the degrees of merit , but prosperity .
The minister , my lords , has defeated his opponents in almost all their attempts  his friends have sounded victory every session , and yet the people declare against him  his adversaries have retired into the country with all the vexation of disappointment , and have been rewarded for their unsuccessful efforts with general acclamations .
What is it , my lords , but the power of truth , that can preserve the vanquished from ridicule , and influence the nation to believe them the only patrons of their commerce and liberty , in opposition to all the writers and voters for the ministry ?


If we consult history , my lords , how seldom do we find an innocent minister overwhelmed with infamy ?
Innocent men have sometimes been destroyed by the hasty fury , but scarcely ever by the settled hatred of the populace .
Even that fury has generally been kindled by real grievances , though imputed to those who had no share in producing them  but when the tempest of their first rage has subsided , they have seldom refused to hear truth , and to distinguish the patriot from the oppressor .


But though it should be acknowledged , my lords , that the people have been blinded by false representations , and that some causes yet undiscovered , some influence which never has been known to operate in any state before , hinder them from beholding their own felicity  yet , as publick happiness is the end of government , and no man can be happy that thinks himself miserable , it is , in my opinion , necessary to the honour of his majesty , and to the tranquillity of the nation , that your lordships should agree to the present motion .


The duke of NEWCASTLE answered to this effect : -- My lords , it is not without wonder that I hear a motion so uncommon and important , a motion which may be reasonably supposed to have been long premeditated , and of which such affecting expectations have been raised , so weakly supported by evidence .
I can not think that any other attestation is needful for the vindication of the right honourable gentleman , whose conduct is this day to be examined , than the declaration of the noble lord , that there appears no positive evidence against him .


The pretence that no evidence can be expected while he continues in his present station , is too openly fallacious to impose upon your lordships  for why should his influence be greater , and his power less resistible than that of other ministers , who are well known to have found accusers in the height of their authority , and to have been dragged to punishment almost from behind the throne ?


It is sufficiently known , that during the continuance of this administration , many have been dismissed from their employments , who appear not altogether unaffected with the loss , and from whose resentment a discovery of wicked measures might be reasonably expected , as their acquaintance with the secrets of the government must have given opportunities of detecting them .
If , therefore , no particular crimes are charged upon him , if his enemies confine themselves to obscure surmises , and general declamations , we may reasonably conclude , that his behaviour has been at least blameless .
For what can be a higher encomium than the silence of those who have made it the business of years to discover something that might be alleged against him on the day of trial .


I suppose that no man can question the penetration of those noble lords who have opened this debate , and I , my lords , shall be very far from insinuating that cowardice suppresses any of their sentiments .
As the highest reproach that can be thrown upon any man , is to suggest that he speaks what he does not think  the next degree of meanness would be to think what he dares not speak , when the publick voice of his country calls upon him .


When , therefore , popular reports are alleged as the foundation of the address , it is probable that it is not founded , in reality , upon known crimes or attested facts , and if the sudden blasts of fame may be esteemed equivalent to attested accusations , what degree of virtue can confer security ?


That the clamour is so loud and so general as it is represented , I can discover no necessity of admitting  but , however the populace may have been exasperated against him , we are surely not to be influenced by their complaints , without inquiring into the cause of them , and informing ourselves whether they proceed from real hardships , unnecessary severities , and calamities too heavy to be borne , or from caprice , and inconstancy , idle rumours , and artful representations .


I very readily allow , my lords , that nothing has been left unattempted that might fill the people with suspicion and discontent .
That inevitable calamities have been imputed to misconduct , or to treachery , and even the inconstancy of the winds and severity of the weather charged upon the right honourable gentleman , the daily libels that are in every man 's hand , are a standing evidence  and though I should grant that the people never complain without cause , and that their burdens are always heavy before they endeavour to shake them off , yet it will by no means follow , that they do not sometimes mistake the cause of their miseries , and impute their burdens to the cruelty of those whose utmost application is employed to lighten them .


Common fame is , therefore , my lords , no sufficient ground for such a censure as this , a censure that condemns a man long versed in high employments , long honoured with the confidence of his sovereign , and distinguished by the friendship of the most illustrious persons in the nation , to infamy and contempt , unheard , and even unaccused  for he against whom nothing is produced but general charges , supported by the evidence of common fame , may be justly esteemed to be free from accusation .


That other evidence will appear against him when he shall be reduced , in consequence of our agreeing to this motion , to the level with his fellow-subjects , that all informations are now precluded by the terrours of resentment , or the expectations of favour , has been insinuated by the noble lord , who made the motion : whether his insinuation be founded only upon conjecture , whether it be one of those visions which are raised by hope in a warm imagination , or upon any private informations communicated to his lordship , I pretend not to determine  but if we may judge from the known conduct of the opposition , if we consider their frequent triumphs before the battle , and their chimerical schemes of discoveries , or prosecutions and punishments , their constant assurance of success upon the approach of a new contest , and their daily predictions of the ruin of the administration , we can not but suspect that men so long accustomed to impose upon themselves , and flatter one another with fallacious hopes , may now , likewise , be dreaming of intelligence which they never will receive , and amusing themselves with suspicions which they have no reasonable expectation of seeing confirmed .


And to confess the truth , my lords , if I may be allowed , in imitation of these patrons of their country , to indulge my own imagination , and presume to look forward to the future conduct of those who have exerted such unwearied industry in their attempts upon the administration , and so long pursued the right honourable gentleman with inquiries , examinations , rhetorick , and ridicule , I can not but find myself inclined to question whether , after their motion shall have been received in this house , and their petition granted by his majesty , they will very solicitously inquire after evidence , or be equally diligent in the discovery of truth , as in the persecution of the minister .


I am afraid , my lords , that they will be too deeply engaged in the care of making a dividend of the plunder in just proportions , to find leisure for pursuit of the enemy , and that the sight of vacant posts , large salaries , and extensive power , will revive some passions , which the love of their country has not yet wholly extinguished , and leave in their attention no room for deep reflections , and intricate inquiries .
There have formerly , my lords , been patriots , who , upon a sudden advancement to a place of profit , have been immediately lulled into tranquillity , learned to repose an implicit confidence in the ministers , forgotten to harangue , threaten , inquire , and protest , and spent the remaining part of their lives in the harmless amusement of counting their salaries , perquisites , and gratuities .


How great , my lords , would be the disappointment of the people , that unhappy people which has been long neglected and oppressed , which so justly detests the minister , and calls so loudly for vengeance , when they shall see their defenders remit the vigour of the pursuit , when once the minister flies before them , and instead of driving him into exile , contend about his places !


Unhappy then surely , my lords , would the nation be : the administration , we are told , is already universally abhorred , and its hope is only in the opposition  but should the zeal of the patriots once grow cold , should they discover to the publick , that they have been labouring not for general liberty , but for private advantage  that they were enemies to power only because it was not in their hands  and disapproved the measures of the government only because they were not consulted  how inevitably must the people then sink into despair  how certain must they then imagine their destruction ?


It seems , therefore , my lords , equally prudent and just to reject this motion , till better proof shall be brought to support it  lest , by complying with it , we should heighten rather than appease the discontent of the people  lest we should too soon deprive them of their only consolation , and expose the patriots to censure , without vindicating the ministry .


In my opinion , my lords , all who have approved the conduct of the present ministry , must necessarily join in rejecting the motion , as cruel and unequitable , and incline to support a just , and continue a wise administration  and all those whom the restless clamours of the opposite party have persuaded to regard them as arbitrary , corrupt , and perfidious , must , if they are true friends to their country , and steady exacters of justice , resolve to defer their compliance , in order to bring to light the evidences necessary for a legal conviction , and severer punishment .


That these evidences will never be found , and that , therefore , no legal punishment will ever be inflicted , we may reasonably collect from the injustice of the laboured charge which your lordships have now heard  a charge drawn up with all the assistance of senatorial and political knowledge , and displayed with all the power of eloquence , a collection of every occurrence for many years , of which any circumstance could be shown in an unfavourable light , and a recapitulation of all the measures which have miscarried by unforeseen events , or which the populace have been persuaded to dislike .


In the administration of governments , my lords , many measures reasonable and just , planned out in pursuance of a very exact knowledge of the state of things then present , and very probable conjectures concerning future events , have yet failed to produce the success which was expected  they have been sometimes defeated by the inconstancy or dishonesty of those who are equally engaged in them , and sometimes frustrated by accidents , of which only providence has the disposal .
It will even be allowed , my lords , that the ministry have been sometimes mistaken in their conjectures , and , perhaps , deceived by their intelligence , but I will presume to say , it never will be discovered that they willingly betrayed , or heedlessly neglected their trust , that they ever oppressed their country with unnecessary burdens , or exposed it to be insulted by foreign powers .
Nor will it , perhaps , be found that they ever appeared grossly ignorant of the publick interest , or failed to discover any obvious truth , or foresee any probable contingencies .


But , my lords , I am willing to confess that they can not judge of events to come with such unerring and demonstrative knowledge as their opponents can obtain of them after they have happened  and they are inclined to pay all necessary deference to the great sagacity of those wonderful prognosticators , who can so exactly foresee the past .
They only hope , my lords , that you will consider how much harder their task is than that of their enemies  they are obliged to determine very often upon doubtful intelligence , and an obscure view of the designs and inclinations of the neighbouring powers  and as their informers may be either treacherous or mistaken , and the interests of other states are subject to alterations , they may be sometimes deceived and disappointed .
But their opponents , my lords , are exempt , by their employment , from the laborious task of searching into futurity , and collecting their resolutions , from a long comparison of dark hints and minute circumstances .
Their business is not to lead or show the way , but to follow at a distance , and ridicule the perplexity , and aggravate the mistakes of their guides .
They are only to wait for consequences , which , if they are prosperous , they misrepresent as not intended , or pass over in silence , and are glad to hide them from the notice of mankind .
But if any miscarriages arise , their penetration immediately awakes , they see , at the first glance , the fatal source of all our miseries , they are astonished at such a concatenation of blunders , and alarmed with the most distracting apprehensions of the danger of their country .


Accusation of political measures is an easy province  easy , my lords , in the same proportion as the administration of affairs is difficult  for where there are difficulties there will be some mistakes  and where there are mistakes , there will be occasions of triumph , to the factious and the disappointed .
But the justice of your lordships will certainly distinguish between errours and crimes , and between errours of weakness and inability , and such as are only discoverable by consequences .


I may add , my lords , that your wisdom will easily find the difference between the degree of capacity requisite for recollecting the past , and foreknowing the future  and expect that those whose ambition incites them to endeavour after a share in the government of their country , should give better proofs of their qualifications for that high trust , than mere specimens of their memory , their rhetorick , or their malice .


Even the noble lord , who must be confessed to have shown a very extensive acquaintance with foreign affairs , and to have very accurately considered the interests and dispositions of the princes of Europe , has yet failed in the order of time , and by one errour very much invalidated his charge of misconduct in foreign affairs .


The treaty of Vienna , my lords , was not produced by the rejection of the infanta , unless a treaty that was made before it could be the consequence of it  so that there was no such opportunity thrown into our hands as the noble lord has been pleased to represent .
Spain had discovered herself our enemy , and our enemy in the highest degree , before the French provoked her by that insult  and , therefore , how much soever she might be enraged against France , there was no prospect that she would favour us , nor could we have courted her alliance without the lowest degree of meanness and dishonour .


See then , my lords , this atrocious accusation founded upon false dates , upon a preposterous arrangement of occurrences  behold it vanish into smoke at the approach of truth , and let this instance convince us how easy it is to form chimerical blunders , and impute gross follies to the wisest administration  how easy it is to charge others with mistakes and how difficult to avoid them .


But we are told , my lords , that the dangers of the confederacy at Vienna were merely imaginary , that no contract was made to the disadvantage of our dominions , or of our commerce , and that if the weakness of the Spaniards and Germans had contrived such a scheme , it would soon have been discovered by them to be an airy dream , a plan impossible to be reduced to execution .


We have been amused , my lords , on this occasion with great profusion of mirth and ridicule , and have received the consolation of hearing that Britain is an island , and that an island is not to be invaded without ships .
We have been informed of the nature of the king 's territories , and of the natural strength of the fortress of Gibraltar  but the noble lord forgot that though Britain has no dominions on the continent , yet our sovereign has there a very extensive country , which , though we are not to make war for the sake of strengthening or enlarging it , we are , surely , to defend when we have drawn an invasion upon it .


The weakness of the Spaniards , my lords , has been also much enlarged upon , but the strength of the jacobites at home has been passed over in silence , though it is apparent how easily the pretender might have landed here , and with what warmth his cause would have been espoused , not only by those whose religion avowed and professed makes them the enemies of the present royal family , but by many whom prospects of interest , the love of novelty , and rage of disappointment , might have inclined to a change .


That no such stipulations were made by that treaty , that no injury was intended to our commerce , nor any invasion proposed in favour of the pretender , are very bold assertions , and though they could be supported by all the evidence that negatives admit of , yet will not easily be believed by your lordships , in opposition to the solemn assurances of his late majesty .
It is evident , from this instance , how much prejudice prevails over argument  they are ready to condemn the right honourable gentleman to whom they give the title of sole minister , upon the suffrage of common fame , yet will not acquit him upon the testimony of the king himself .


But , my lords , the arguments alleged to prove the improbability of such a confederacy , are so weak in themselves , that they require no such illustrious evidence to overbalance them .
For upon what are they founded , but upon the impossibility of executing such designs ?


It is well known , my lords , how differently different parties consider the same cause , the same designs , and the same state of affairs .
Every man is partial in favour of his own equity , strength , and sagacity .
Who can show that the same false opinion of their own power , and of our intestine divisions , which now prompts the Spaniards to contend with us , might not then incite them to invade us , or at least to countenance the attempts of one , whom they are industriously taught to believe the greatest part of the nation is ready to receive ?


That they might have injured our trade is too evident from our present experience , and that they would have supported the Ostend company , which they espoused in an open manner , is undeniable .
Nor is it in the least unlikely , that , elated with the certain power of doing much mischief , and with the imaginary prospects of far greater effects , they might engage in a confederacy , and farther attempts against us .


I am far from imagining , my lords , that it was in the power of the Germans and Spaniards united to force the pretender upon us , though we had stood alone against them  but the impossibility of succeeding in their design was not then so apparent to them as it is at present to us  they had many reasons to wish , and therefore would not be long without some to believe it practicable  and it was not the danger but the insult that determined his late majesty to enter into an alliance with France .


War , my lords , is always to be avoided , if the possessions and reputation of a people can be preserved without it  it was , therefore , more eligible to oblige them to lay aside their scheme while it was yet only in idea , than to defeat it in its execution .
And an alliance with France effectually restrained the emperour , as our fleets in America reduced the Spaniards to desire peace .


Why we did not seize the cargo of the galleons , has been often asked , and as often such answers have been returned as ought to satisfy any rational examiner .
We did not seize them , my lords , because a larger part belonged to other nations than to the Spaniards , and because the interests of our trade made it convenient not to exasperate the Spaniards , so far as to render a reconciliation very difficult .


In the terms of this reconciliation , my lords , it is charged upon the ministry , that they were guilty of contributing to the power of the house of Bourbon , by stipulating that Spain , instead of neutral troops , should be introduced into Italy .
That those troops were less agreeable to the emperour can not be denied , but it has already been shown how little reason we had to consult his satisfaction  and with regard to the advantages gained by the French and Spaniards in the late war , a very small part of them can be ascribed to six thousand troops .


With as little reason , my lords , is the charge advanced of neglecting to preserve the balance of Europe , by declining to assist the emperour against the French  for the intention of the war seems to have been rather revenge than conquest , and the emperour rather exchanged than lost his dominions .


That we declined engaging too far in the affairs of the continent , proceeded , my lords , from a regard to the trade of the nation , which is not only suspended and interrupted during the time of war , but often thrown into another channel , out of which it is the business of many years to recover it .


Nor have the ministry , my lords , deviated from their regard to trade , in their transactions with Spain , which have been the subject of so much clamour , and such pathetick declamations  they always knew what the nation now feels , that the merchants would suffer much more from a war than from piracies and depredations , which , however , they were far from submitting to , and for which they constantly made demands of satisfaction .
To these demands they received such answers , as , if they had been sincere , would have left the nation no room to complain  but when it was discovered that nothing but verbal satisfaction was to be expected , the security of our trade , and the honour of our country , demanded that war should be declared .


The conduct of the war , my lords , has been frequently the subject of censure  we are told of the inactivity of one fleet , and the imperfect equipment of another , the escape of our enemies , and the interception of our trading ships .
War , my lords , is confessed to be uncertain , and ill success is not always the consequence of bad measures : naval wars are by the nature of the element on which they are to be conducted , more uncertain than any other  so that , though it can not but be suspected that the common people will murmur at any disappointment , call every misfortune a crime , and think themselves betrayed by the ministry , if Spain is not reduced in a single summer , it might be reasonably hoped , that men enlightened by a long familiarity with the accounts of past , and instructed by personal experience in national transactions , will produce stronger arguments than want of success , when they charge the ministry with misconduct in war .


But , my lords , they have not any misfortunes to complain of  nor is the accusation , that we have been defeated ourselves , but that we have not enough molested our enemies .
Of this , my lords , it is not easy to judge , at a distance from the scene of action , and without a more accurate knowledge of a thousand minute circumstances , which may promote or retard a naval expedition .
It is undoubtedly true , my lords , that many of our merchant ships have been taken by the enemy  but it is not certain that they do not murmur equally that they have been obstructed in their commerce , and have been so little able to interrupt ours , since they have so many advantages from the situation of their coasts .
When we reckon those that are lost , let us not forget to number those that have escaped .
If admiral Vernon 's fleet was ill provided with arms and ammunition , even then , let all censure be suspended till it can be proved that it was ill furnished by the fault of the ministry .


Nothing is more common , my lords , in all naval wars , than sudden changes of fortune  for on many occasions an accidental gust of wind , or unexpected darkness of the weather , may destroy or preserve a fleet from destruction , or may make the most formidable armaments absolutely useless  and in the present disposition of some people towards the ministry , I should not wonder to hear an alteration of wind charged upon them .


For what objections may they not expect , my lords , when all the disadvantages which the nation suffers from the enemies of his majesty , are imputed to them  when daily endeavours are used to make them suspected of favouring arbitrary power , for maintaining an army which nothing has made necessary but the struggles of those men whose principles have no other tendency than to enslave their country .
Let not our domestick animosities be kept alive and fomented by a constant opposition to every design of the administration , nor our foreign enemies incited by the observation of our divisions , to treat us with insolence , interrupt our trade , prescribe bounds to our dominions , and threaten us with invasions -- and the army may safely be disbanded .


For the ministry , my lords , are not conscious of having consulted any thing but the happiness of the nation , and have , therefore , no apprehensions of publick resentment , nor want the protection of an armed force .
They desire only the support of the laws , and to them they willingly appeal from common fame and unequitable charges .


I mention the ministry , my lords , because I am unacquainted with any man who either claims or possesses the power or title of sole minister .
I own , in my province , no superiour but his majesty , and am willing and ready to answer any charge which relates to that part of the publick business which I have had the honour to transact or direct .


A great part of what I have now offered was , therefore , no otherwise necessary on the present occasion , than because silence might have appeared like a consciousness of misconduct , and have afforded a new subject of airy triumph to the enemies of the administration  for very few of the transactions which have been so severely censured , fell under the particular inspection of the right honourable gentleman against whom the motion is levelled  he was not otherwise concerned in counselling or in ratifying , than as one of his majesty 's privy council  and , therefore , though they should be defective , I do not see how it is reasonable or just , that he should be singled out from the rest for disgrace or punishment .


The motion , therefore , my lords , appears to me neither founded on facts , nor law , nor reason , nor any better grounds than popular caprice , and private malevolence .


If it is contrary to law to punish without proof  if it is not agreeable to reason that one should be censured for the offences of another  if it is necessary that some crime should be proved before any man can suffer as a criminal , then , my lords , I am convinced that your lordships will be unanimous in rejecting the motion .


The duke of ARGYLE spoke next , as follows : -- My lords , if we will obstinately shut our eyes against the light of conviction  if we will resolutely admit every degree of evidence that contributes to support the cause which we are inclined to favour , and to reject the plainest proofs when they are produced against it , to reason and debate is to little purpose : as no innocence can be safe that has incurred the displeasure of partial judges , so no criminal that has the happiness of being favoured by them , can ever be in danger .


That any lord has already determined how to vote on the present occasion , far be it from me to assert : may it never , my lords , be suspected that private interest , blind adherence to a party , personal kindness or malevolence , or any other motive than a sincere and unmingled regard for the prosperity of our country , influences the decisions of this assembly  for it is well known , my lords , that authority is founded on opinion  when once we lose the esteem of the publick , our votes , while we shall be allowed to give them , will be only empty sounds , to which no other regard will be paid than a standing army shall enforce .


The veneration of the people , my lords , will not easily be lost : this house has a kind of hereditary claim to their confidence and respect  the great actions of our ancestors are remembered , and contribute to the reputation of their successours  nor do our countrymen willingly suspect that they can be betrayed by the descendants of those , by whose bravery and counsels they have been rescued from destruction .


But esteem must languish , and confidence decline , unless they are renewed and reanimated by new acts of beneficence  and the higher expectations the nation may have formed of our penetration to discover its real advantages , and of our steadiness to pursue them , the more violent will be its resentment , if it shall appear , on this important question , that we are either ignorant or timorous , that we are unconcerned at the miseries of the people , or content ourselves with pitying what our ancestors never failed to redress .


Let us , therefore , my lords , for our own interest , attend impartially to the voice of the people  let us hear their complaints with tenderness , and if , at last , we reject them , let it be evident that they were impartially heard , and that we only differed from them because we were not convinced .


Even then , my lords , we shall suffer , for some time , under the suspicion of crimes , from which I hope we shall always be free  the people will imagine that we were influenced by those whose interest it appears to continue their miseries , and , my lords , all the consolation that will be left us , must arise from the consciousness of having done our duty .


But , my lords , this is to suppose what I believe no history can furnish an example of  it is to conceive that we may inquire diligently after the true state of national affairs , and yet not discover it , or not be able to prove it by such evidence as may satisfy the people .


The people , my lords , however they are misrepresented by those who , from a long practice of treating them with disregard , have learned to think and speak of them with contempt , are far from being easily deceived , and yet farther from being easily deceived into an opinion of their own unhappiness : we have some instances of general satisfaction , and an unshaken affection to the government , in times when the publick good has not been very diligently consulted , but scarcely any of perpetual murmurs and universal discontent , where there have been plain evidences of oppression , negligence , or treachery .


Let us not , therefore , my lords , think of the people as of a herd to be led or driven at pleasure , as wretches whose opinions are founded upon the authority of seditious scribblers , or upon any other than that of reason and experience  let us not suffer them to be at once oppressed and ridiculed , nor encourage , by our example , the wretched advocates for those whom they consider as their enemies , nor represent them as imputing to the misconduct of the ministry the late contrariety of the winds , and severity of the winter .


The people , my lords , if they are mistaken in their charge , are mistaken with such evidence on their side , as never misled any nation before  not only their reason but their senses must have betrayed them  and those marks of certainty that have hitherto established truth , must have combined in the support of falsehood .


They are persuaded , my lords , too firmly persuaded , to yield up their opinions to rhetorick , or to votes , or any proof but demonstration , that there is a first , or , to speak in the language of the nation , a sole minister , one that has the possession of his sovereign 's confidence , and the power of excluding others from his presence , one that exalts and degrades at his pleasure , and distributes , for his own purposes , the revenues of his master , and the treasure of the nation .


Of this , my lords , can it be maintained that they have no proof ?
Can this be termed a chimerical suspicion , which nothing can be produced to support ?
How can power appear but by the exercise of it ?
What can prove any degree of influence or authority , but universal submission and acknowledgment ?
And surely , my lords , a very transient survey of the court and its dependents , must afford sufficient conviction , that this man is considered by all that are engaged in the administration , as the only disposer of honours , favours , and employments .


Attend to any man , my lords , who has lately been preferred , rewarded , or caressed , you will hear no expressions of gratitude but to that man  no other benefactor is ever heard of , the royal bounty itself is forgotten and unmentioned , nor is any return of loyalty , fidelity , or adherence professed , but to the minister  the minister !
a term which , however lately introduced , is now in use in every place in the kingdom , except this house .


Preferments , my lords , whether civil , ecclesiastical , or military , are either wholly in his hands , or those who make it the business of their lives to discover the high road to promotion , are universally deceived , and are daily offering their adorations to an empty phantom that has nothing to bestow  for , no sooner is any man infected with avarice or ambition , no sooner is extravagance reduced to beg new supplies from the publick , or wickedness obliged to seek for shelter , than this man is applied to , and honour , conscience , and fortune offered at his feet .


Did either those whose studies and station give them a claim to advancement in the church , or those whose bravery and long service entitle them to more honourable posts in the army  did either those who profess to understand the laws of their own country , or they who declare themselves versed in the interests and transactions of foreign powers , apply to any other man for promotion or employment , he might then , indeed , be called the chief , but not properly the sole minister .


But it is well known , my lords  many of us know it too well , that whatever be the profession or the abilities of any person , there is no hope of encouragement or reward by any other method than that of application to this man , that he shall certainly be disappointed who shall attempt to rise by any other interest , and whoever shall dare to depend on his honesty , bravery , diligence , or capacity , or to boast any other merit than that of implicit adherence to his measures , shall inevitably lie neglected and obscure .


For this reason , my lords , every one whose calmness of temper can enable him to support the sight , without starts of indignation and sallies of contempt , may daily see at the levee of this great man , what I am ashamed to mention , a mixture of men of all ranks and all professions , of men whose birth and titles ought to exalt them above the meanness of cringing to a mere child of fortune , men whose studies ought to have taught them , that true honour is only to be gained by steady virtue , and that all other arts , all the low applications of flattery and servility will terminate in contempt , disappointment , and remorse .


This scene , my lords , is daily to be viewed , it is ostentatiously displayed to the sight of mankind , the minister amuses himself in publick with the splendour , and number , and dignity of his slaves  and his slaves with no more shame pay their prostrations to their master in the face of day , and boast of their resolutions to gratify and support him .
And yet , my lords , it is inquired why the people assert that there is a sole minister ?


Those who deny , my lords , that there is a sole minister to whom the miscarriages of the government may justly be imputed , may easily persuade themselves to believe that there have been no miscarriages , that all the measures were necessary , and well formed , that there is neither poverty nor oppression felt in the nation , that our compliance with France was no weakness , and that our dread of the treaty of Vienna was not chimerical .


The treaty of Vienna , my lords , which has been the parent of so many terrours , consultations , embassies , and alliances is , I find , not yet to be acknowledged , what it certainly was , a mere phantom , an empty illusion , sent by the arts of the French to terrify our ministry .
His late majesty 's testimony is cited to prove that stipulations were really entered into by the two powers allied by that treaty , to destroy our trade , subvert our constitution , and set a new king upon the throne , without consent of the nation .


Such improbabilities , my lords , ought , indeed , to be proved by a high testimony , by a testimony which no man shall dare to question or contradict  for as any man is at liberty to consult his reason , it will always remonstrate to him , that it is no less absurd to impute the folly of designing impossibilities to any powers not remarkable for weak counsels , than unjust to suspect princes of intending injuries , to which they have not been incited by any provocation .


But , my lords , nowithstanding the solemnity with which his late majesty has been introduced , his testimony can prove nothing more than that he believed the treaty to be such as he represents , that he had been deceived into false apprehensions and unnecessary cautions by his own ministers , as they had been imposed upon by the agents of France .


This is all , my lords , that can be collected from the royal speech , and to infer more from it is to suppose that the king was himself a party in the designs formed against him  for if he was not himself engaged in this treaty , he could only be informed , by another , of the stipulations , and could only report what he had been told upon the credit of the informer , a man , necessarily of very little credit .
Thus , my lords , all the evidence of his late majesty vanishes into nothing more than the whisper of a spy .


But as great stress ought , doubtless , to be laid upon intelligence which the nation is believed to purchase at a very high price , let it be inquired , what proofs those have who dare to suspect the sagacity of our ministers , to put in the balance against their intelligence , and it will be discovered , my lords , that they have a testimony no less than that of the German emperour himself , who could not be mistaken with regard to the meaning of the treaty concluded at his own court , and to whom it will not be very decent to deny such a degree of veracity as may set him at least on the level with a traitor and a hireling .


If the treaty of Vienna was an imposture , most of our misfortunes are evidently produced by the weakness of the minister  but even supposing it real , as it was only a formidable mockery , an idle threat , that could never be executed , it was not necessary , that in order to obviate it , we should give ourselves implicitly into the hands of France .


It was not necessary , my lords , that we should suffer them first to elude the treaty of Utrecht , by making a port at Mardyke , and then directly and openly to violate it by repairing Dunkirk .
That this latter is a port contrary to treaty , the bills of entry at the custom-house daily show  and as the customs are particularly under the inspection of the commissioners of the treasury , this man can not plead ignorance of this infraction , were no information given him by other means .
If it should now be asked , my lords , what , in my opinion , ought to be done , I can not advise that we should attempt to demolish it by force , or draw upon ourselves the whole power of France by a declaration of war , but what it may be difficult now to remedy , it was once easy to obviate .


Had we shown the same contempt of the French power with our ancestors , and the same steadiness in our councils , the same firmness in our alliances , and the same spirit in our treaties , that court would never have ventured to break a known solemn stipulation , to have exasperated a brave and determined adversary by flagrant injustice , and to have exposed themselves to the hazard of a war , in which it would have been the interest of every prince of Europe who regarded justice or posterity to wish their defeat .


Now they see us engaged in a war , my lords , they may be animated to a more daring contempt of the faith of treaties , and insult us with yet greater confidence of success , as they can not but remark the cowardice or the ignorance with which we have hitherto carried on this war .
They can not but observe that either our minister means in reality to make war rather upon the Britons than the Spaniards , or that he is totally unacquainted with military affairs , and too vain to ask the opinion of others who have greater knowledge than himself .


Nothing , my lords , is more apparent than that the minister was forced , by the continual clamours of the nation , to declare war , contrary to his own inclination , and that he always affected to charge it upon others , and to exempt himself from the imputation of it .
It is , therefore , probable that he has not acted on this occasion so wisely as even his own experience and penetration might , if they were honestly employed , enable him to act , and that he has suffered our counsels to be embarrassed  that he sees with great tranquillity those suffering by the war , at whose request it was begun , and imagines it a proof of the excellence of his own scheme , that those who forced him to break it , may in time repent of their importunities .


For that in the management of the war , my lords , no regard has been had either to the advantages which the course of our trade inevitably gives to our enemies , or to the weakness to which the extent of their dominions necessarily subjects them , that neither the interest of the merchant has been consulted , nor the ease of the nation in general regarded , that the treasure of the publick has been squandered , and that our military preparations have intimidated no nation but our own , is evident beyond contradiction .


It is well known , my lords , to every man but the minister , that we have nothing to fear from either the fleets or armies of the Spaniards , that they can not invade us except in America , and that they can only molest us by intercepting our traders .
This they can only effect by means of their privateers , whose vessels , being light and active , may be easily fitted out , nimbly seize their prey , and speedily retire .


The experience of the last French war , my lords , might have taught us how much we have to fear from the activity of men incited by prospects of private gain , and equipped with that care and vigilance , which , however omitted in national affairs , the interest of particular men never fails to dictate .
It is well known , my lords , how much we lost amidst our victories and triumphs , and how small security the merchants received from our magnificent navies , and celebrated commanders .
It was , therefore , surely the part of wise men , not to miscarry twice by the same omission , when they had an opportunity to supply it .


I need not inform your lordships of what every reader of newspapers can tell , and which common sense must easily discover , that privateers are only to be suppressed by ships of the same kind with their own , which may scour the seas with rapidity , pursue them into shallow water , where great ships can not attack them , seize them as they leave the harbours , or destroy them upon their own coasts .


That this is , in its own nature , at once obvious to be contrived , and easy to be done , must appear upon the bare mention of it , and yet that it has been either treacherously neglected , or ignorantly omitted , the accounts of every day have long informed us .
Not a week passes in which our ships are not seized , and our sailors carried into a state of slavery .
Nor does this happen only on the wide ocean , which is too spacious to be garrisoned , or upon our enemies ' coasts , where they may have , sometimes , insuperable advantages , but on our own shores , within sight of our harbours , and in those seas of which we vainly style our nation the sovereign .


Who is there , my lords , whose indignation is not raised at such ignominy ?
Who is there by whom such negligence will not be resented ?
It can not be alleged that we had not time to make better preparations  we had expected war long before we declared it , and if the minister was the only man by whom it was not expected , it will make another head of accusation .


Nor was his disregard of our dominions less flagrant than that of our trade : it was publickly declared by don Geraldino , that his master would never give up his claim to part of our American colonies , which yet were neither fortified on the frontiers , nor supplied with arms , nor enabled to oppose an enemy , nor protected against him .


One man there is , my lords , whose natural generosity , contempt of danger , and regard for the publick , prompted him to obviate the designs of the Spaniards , and to attack them in their own territories  a man , whom by long acquaintance I can confidently affirm to have been equal to his undertaking , and to have learned the art of war by a regular education , who yet miscarried in his design , only for want of supplies necessary to a possibility of success .


Nor is there , my lords , much probability that the forces sent lately to Vernon will be more successful  for this is not a war to be carried on by boys : the state of the enemy 's dominions is such , partly by situation , and partly by the neglect of that man whose conduct we are examining , that to attack them with any prospect of advantage , will require the judgment of an experienced commander  of one who had learned his trade , not in Hyde-park , but in the field of battle  of one that has been accustomed to sudden exigencies and unsuspected difficulties , and has learned cautiously to form , and readily to vary his schemes .


An officer , my lords , an officer qualified to invade kingdoms is not formed by blustering in his quarters , by drinking on birth-nights , or dancing at assemblies  nor even by the more important services of regulating elections , and suppressing those insurrections which are produced by the decay of our manufactures .
Many gallant colonels have led out their forces against women and children , with the exactest order , and scattered terrour over numerous bodies of colliers and weavers , who would find difficulties not very easily surmountable , were they to force a pass , or storm a fortress .


But , my lords , those whom we have destined for the conquest of America , have not even flushed their arms with such services , nor have learned , what is most necessary to be learned , the habit of obedience  they are only such as the late frost hindered from the exercise of their trades , and forced to seek for bread in the service  they have scarcely had time to learn the common motions of the exercise , or distinguish the words of command .


Nor are their officers , my lords , extremely well qualified to supply those defects , and establish discipline and order in a body of new-raised forces  for they are absolutely strangers to service , and taken from school to receive a commission , or if transplanted from other regiments , have had time only to learn the art of dress .
We have sent soldiers undisciplined , and officers unable to instruct them , and sit in expectation of conquests to be made by one boy acting under the direction of another .


To their commander-in-chief , my lords , I object nothing but his inexperience , which is by no means to be imputed to his negligence , but his want of opportunities  though of the rest , surely it may be said , that they are such a swarm as were never before sent out on military designs  and , in my opinion , to the other equipments , the government should have added provisions for women to nurse them .


Had my knowledge of war , my lords , been thought sufficient to have qualified me for the chief command in this expedition , or had my advice been asked with regard to the conduct of it , I should willingly have assisted my country with my person or my counsels  but , my lords , this man , who engrosses all authority , seems , likewise , to believe that he is in possession of all knowledge , and that he is equally capable , as he is equally willing , to usurp the supreme and uncontroulable direction both of civil and military affairs .


Why new forces were raised , my lords , it is very easy to judge  new forces required new commissions , and new commissions produced new dependencies , which might be of use to the minister at the approaching election  but why the new-raised troops were sent on this expedition rather than those which had been longer disciplined , it is very difficult to assign a reason , unless it was considered that some who had commands in them had likewise seats in the senate  and the minister was too grateful to expose his friends to danger , and too prudent to hazard the loss of a single vote .
Besides the commander-in-chief , there is but one senator in the expedition , and , my lords , he is one of too great integrity to be corrupted , and , though sensible of the weakness of the troops , too brave to quit his post .
How much our country may suffer by such absurd conduct , I need not explain to your lordships  it may easily be conceived how much one defeat may dispirit the nation , and to what attempts one victory may excite our enemies  those enemies whom , under a steady and wise administration , we should terrify into submission , even without an army .


I can not forbear to remark on this occasion , how much the ignorance of this man has exposed a very important part of our foreign dominions to the attempts of the Spaniards .
Gibraltar , my lords , is well known to be so situated , as to be naturally in very little danger of an attack from the land , and to command the country to a great distance  but these natural advantages are now taken away , or greatly lessened , by new fortifications , erected within much less than gunshot of the place , erected in the sight of the garrison , and while one of our admirals was cruizing upon the coast .


The pretence , my lords , upon which they were erected , was , that though Gibraltar was granted to Britain , yet there was no district appendent to it , nor did the British authority extend beyond the walls of the town : this poor excuse did the chicanery of the Spaniards invent , and with this , my lords , was our minister contented , either not knowing or not appearing to know what , I hope , the children whom we have despatched to America have been taught , and what no man , versed in national affairs , can be ignorant of without a crime , that when a fortress is yielded to another nation , the treaty always virtually includes , even without mentioning it , an extent of land as far as the guns of the fortification can reach .


Whether this man , my lords , was so ignorant as to be deceived thus grossly , or so abandoned as willingly to deceive his country , he is equally unqualified to support the office of first minister , and almost equally deserves to be prosecuted by the indignation and justice of this assembly , in the severest manner  for how great must be his wickedness who undertakes a charge above his abilities , when his country may be probably ruined by his errours ?


Your lordships can not but observe , that I make use rather of the term minister than that of the administration , which others are so desirous to substitute in its place , either to elude all inquiry into the management of our affairs , or to cover their own shameful dependence .


Administration , my lords , appears to me a term without a meaning , a wild indeterminate word , of which none can tell whom it implies , or how widely it may extend : a charge against the administration may be imagined a general censure of every officer in the whole subordination of government , a general accusation of instruments and agents , of masters and slaves : my charge , my lords , is against the minister , against that man , who is believed by every one in the nation , and known by great numbers , to have the chief , and , whenever he pleases to require it , the sole direction of the publick measures  he , to whom all the other ministers owe their elevation , and by whose smile they hold their power , their salaries , and their dignity .


That this appellation is not without sufficient reason bestowed upon that man , I have already proved to your lordships  and as it has already been made appear that common fame is a sufficient ground of accusation , it will easily be shown that this man has a just claim to the title of minister  for if any man be told of an accusation of the minister  he will not ask the name of the person accused .


But there is in the motion one title conferred upon him , to which he has no pretensions  for there is no law for styling him the first commissioner of the treasury .
The commissioners , my lords , who discharge , in a collective capacity , the office of lord high treasurer , are constituted by the same patent , invested with equal power and equal dignity , and I know not why this man should be exalted to any superiority over his associates .


If we take , my lords , a review of our affairs , and examine the state of the nation in all its relations and all its circumstances , we can not , surely , conceive that we are in a state of prosperity , unless discontent at home , and scorn abroad , the neglect of our allies , and insolence of our enemies , the decay of trade , and multitude of our imposts , are to be considered as proofs of a prosperous and nourishing nation .


Will it be alleged , my lords , has this man one friend adventurous enough to assert , in open day , that the people are not starving by thousands , and murmuring by millions , that universal misery does not overspread the nation , and that this horrid series of calamities is not universally , among all conditions , imputed to the conduct of this man ?


That great evils are felt , my lords , no Briton , I am certain , who converses promiscuously with his countrymen , will attempt to dispute , and until some other cause more proportioned to the effect shall be assigned , I shall join the publick in their opinion , and while I think this man the author of our miseries , shall conclude it necessary to comply with the motion .


Lord HARDWICK spoke next , to the following effect : -- My lords , though I very readily admit that crimes ought to be punished , that a treacherous administration of publick affairs is , in a very high degree , criminal , that even ignorance , where it is the consequence of neglect , deserves the severest animadversion , and that it is the privilege and duty of this house to watch over the state of the nation , and inform his majesty of any errours committed by his ministers  yet I am far from being convinced either of the justice or necessity of the motion now under consideration .


The most flagrant and invidious part of the charge against the right honourable gentleman appears to consist in this , that he has engrossed an exorbitant degree of power , and usurped an unlimited influence over the whole system of government , that he disposes of all honours and preferments , and that he is not only first but sole minister .


But of this boundless usurpation , my lords , what proof has been laid before you ?
What beyond loud exaggerations , pompous rhetorick , and specious appeals to common fame  common fame , which , at least , may sometimes err , and which , though it may afford sufficient ground for suspicion and inquiry , was never yet admitted as conclusive evidence , where the immediate necessities of the publick did not preclude the common forms of examination , where the power of the offender did not make it dangerous to attack him by a legal prosecution , or where the conduct of the accusers did not plainly discover that they were more eager of blood than of justice , and more solicitous to destroy than to convict .


I hope none of these circumstances , my lords , can at present obstruct a candid and deliberate inquiry : with regard to the publick , I am not able to discover any pressing exigencies that demand a more compendious method of proceeding , than the established laws of the land , and the wisdom of our ancestors have prescribed .
I know not any calamity that will be aggravated , nor any danger that will become move formidable , by suffering this question to be legally tried .


Nor is there , my lords , in the circumstances of the person accused , any thing that can incite us to a hasty process  for , if what is alleged by the noble lords is not exaggerated beyond the truth , if he is universally detested by the whole nation , and loaded with execrations by the publick voice  if he is considered as the author of all our miseries , and the source of all our corruptions  if he has ruined our trade , and depressed our power , impoverished the people , and attempted to enslave them , there is , at least , no danger of an insurrection in his favour , or any probability that his party will grow stronger by delays .
For , my lords , to find friends in adversity , and assertors in distress , is only the prerogative of innocence and virtue .


The gentleman against whom this formidable charge is drawn up , is , I think , not suspected of any intention to have recourse either to force or flight  he has always appeared willing to be tried by the laws of his country , and to stand an impartial examination  he neither opposes nor eludes inquiry , neither flies from justice , nor defies it .


And yet less , my lords , can I suspect , that those by whom he is accused , act from any motive that may influence them to desire a sentence not supported by evidence , or conformable to truth  or that they can wish the ruin of any man whose crimes are not notorious and flagrant , that they persecute from private malice , or endeavour to exalt themselves by the fall of another .


Let us , therefore , my lords , inquire before we determine , and suffer evidence to precede our sentence .
The charge , if it is just , must be , by its own nature , easily proved , and that no proof is brought may , perhaps , be sufficient to make us suspect that it is not just .


For , my lords , what is the evidence of common fame , which has been so much exalted , and so confidently produced ?
Does not every man see that , on such occasions , two questions may be asked , of which , perhaps , neither can easily be answered , and which , yet , must both be resolved before common fame can be admitted as a proof of facts .


It is first to be inquired , my lords , whether the reports of fame are necessarily or even probably true ?
A question very intricate and diffusive , entangled with a thousand , and involving a thousand , distinctions  a question of which it may be said , that a man may very plausibly maintain either side , and of which , perhaps , after months or years wasted in disputation , no other decision can be obtained than what is obvious at the first view , that they are often true , and often false , and , therefore , can only be grounds of inquiry , not reasons of determination .


But if it appear , my lords , that this oracle can not be deceived , we are then to inquire after another difficulty , we are to inquire , What is fame ?


Is fame , my lords , that fame which can not err ?
a report that flies , on a sudden , through a nation , of which no man can discover the original  a sudden blast of rumour , that inflames or intimidates a people , and obtains , without authority , a general credit ?
No man versed in history can inquire whether such reports may not deceive .
Is fame rather a settled opinion , prevailing by degrees , and for some time established ?
How long , then , my lords , and in what degree must it have been established , to obtain undoubted credit , and when does it commence infallible ?
If the people are divided in their opinions , as in all publick questions it has hitherto happened , fame is , I suppose , the voice of the majority  for , if the two parties are equal in their numbers , fame will be equal  then how great must be the majority before it can lay claim to this powerful auxiliary ?
and how shall that majority be numbered ?


These questions , my lords , may be thought , perhaps with justice , too ludicrous in this place , but , in my opinion , they contribute to show the precarious and uncertain nature of the evidence so much confided in .


Common fame , my lords , is to every man only what he himself commonly hears  and it is in the power of any man 's acquaintance to vitiate the evidence which they report , and to stun him with clamours , and terrify him with apprehensions of miseries never felt , and dangers invisible .
But , without such a combination , we are to remember , that most men associate with those of their own opinions , and that the rank of those that compose this assembly naturally disposes such as are admitted to their company , to relate , or to invent , such reports as may be favourably received , so that what appears to one lord the general voice of common fame , may , by another , be thought only the murmur of a petty faction , despicable , with regard to their numbers , and detestable , if we consider their principles .


So difficult is it , my lords , to form any solid judgment concerning the extent and prevalence of any particular report , and the degree of credit to be given to it .
The industry of a party may supply the defect of numbers , and some concurrent circumstances may contribute to give credit to a false report .


But , my lords , we are ourselves appealed to as witnesses of the truth of facts , which prove him to be sole minister , of the number of his dependents , the advancement of his friends , the disappointments of his opponents , and the declarations made by his followers of adherence and fidelity .


If it should be granted , my lords , that there is nothing in these representations exaggerated beyond the truth , and that nothing is represented in an improper light , what consequence can we draw , but that the followers of this gentleman , make use of those arts which have always been practised by the candidates of preferment , that they endeavour to gain their patron 's smile by flattery and panegyrick , and to keep it by assiduity and an appearance of gratitude .
And if such applications exalted any man to the authority and title of first minister , the nation has never , in my memory , been without some man in that station , for there is always some one to whom ambition and avarice have paid their court , and whose regards have been purchased at the expense of truth .


Nor is it to be wondered at , my lords , that posts of honour and profit have been bestowed upon the friends of the administration  for who enriches or exalts his enemies ?
who will increase the influence that is to be exerted against him , or add strength to the blow that is levelled at himself ?


That the right honourable gentleman is the only disposer of honours , has never yet appeared  it is not pretended , my lords , that he distributes them without the consent of his majesty , nor even that his recommendation is absolutely necessary to the success of any man 's applications .
If he has gained more of his majesty 's confidence and esteem than any other of his servants , he has done only what every man endeavours , and what , therefore , is not to be imputed to him as a crime .


It is impossible , my lords , that kings , like other men , should not have particular motions of inclination or dislike  it is possible that they may fix their affection upon objects not in the highest degree worthy of their regard , and overlook others that may boast of greater excellencies and more shining merit  but this is not to be supposed without proof , and the regard of the king , as of any other man , is one argument of desert more than he can produce , who has endeavoured after it without effect .


This imputed usurpation must be proved upon him either by his own confession , or by the evidence of others  and it has not been yet pretended that he assumes the title of prime minister , or indeed , that it is applied to him by any but his enemies  and it may easily be conceived how weakly the most uncorrupted innocence would be supported , if all the aspersions of its enemies were to be received as proofs against it .


Nor does it appear , my lords , that any other evidence can be brought against him on this head , or that any man will stand forth and affirm that either he has been injured himself by this gentleman , or known any injury done by him to another by the exertion of authority with which he was not lawfully invested  such evidence , my lords , the laws of our country require to be produced before any man can be punished , censured , or disgraced .
No man is obliged to prove his innocence , but may call upon his prosecutors to support their accusation  and why this honourable gentleman , whatever may have been his conduct , should be treated in a different manner than any other criminal , I am by no means able to discover .


Though there has been no evidence offered of his guilt , your lordships have heard an attestation of his innocence , from the noble duke who spoke first against the motion , of whom it can not be suspected that he would , voluntarily , engage to answer for measures which he pursued in blind compliance with the direction of another .
The same testimony , my lords , can I produce , and affirm with equal truth , that in the administration of my province , I am independent , and left entirely to the decisions of my own judgment .


In every government , my lords , as in every family , some , either by accident or a natural industry , or a superiour capacity , or some other cause , will be engaged in more business , and treated with more confidence than others  but if every man is willing to answer for the conduct of his own province , there is all the security against corruption that can possibly be obtained  for if every man 's regard to his own safety and reputation will prevent him from betraying his trust , or abusing his power , much more will it incite him to prevent any misconduct in another for which he must himself be accountable .
Men are , usually , sufficiently tenacious of power , and ready to vindicate their separate rights , when nothing but their pride is affected by the usurpation , but surely no man will patiently suffer his province to be invaded when he may himself be ruined by the conduct of the invader .


Thus , my lords , it appears to me to be not only without proof , but without probability , and the first minister can , in my opinion , be nothing more than a formidable illusion , which , when one man thinks he has seen it , he shows to another , as easily frighted as himself , who joins with him in propagating the notion , and in spreading terrour and resentment over the nation , till at last the panick becomes general , and what was at first only whispered by malice or prejudice in the ears of ignorance or credulity , is adopted by common fame , and echoed back from the people to the senate .


I have hitherto , my lords , confined myself to the consideration of one single article of this complicated charge , because it appears to me to be the only part of it necessary to be examined  for if once it be acknowledged that the affairs of the nation are transacted not by the minister but the administration , by the council in which every man that sits there has an equal voice and equal authority , the blame or praise of all the measures must be transferred from him to the council , and every man that has advised or concurred in them , will deserve the same censure or the same applause  as it is unjust to punish one man for the crimes of another , it is unjust to choose one man out for punishment from among many others equally guilty .


But I doubt not , my lords , when all those measures are equitably considered , there will be no punishment to be dreaded , because neither negligence nor treachery will be discovered .
For , my lords , with regard to the treaty of Vienna , let us suppose our ministers deceived by ignorant or corrupt intelligence , let us admit that they were cautious where there was no danger , and neglected some opportunities , which , if they had received better information , they might have improved to the advantage and security of the nation .
What have they done , even under all these disadvantageous suppositions , but followed the lights which they judged most clear , and by which they hoped to be conducted to honour and to safety ?


Policy , my lords , is very different from prescience  the utmost that can be attained is probability , and that , for the most part , in a low degree .
It is observed , that no man is wise but as you take into consideration the weakness of another  a maxim more eminently true of political wisdom , which consists , very often , only in discovering designs which could never be known but by the folly or treachery of those to whom they are trusted .
If our enemies were wise enough to keep their own secrets , neither our ministers nor our patriots would be able to know or prevent their designs , nor would it be any reproach to their sagacity , that they did not know what nobody would tell them .


If therefore , my lords , the princes , whose interest is contrary to our own , have been at any time served by honest and wise men , there was a time when our ministers could act only by conjecture , and might be mistaken without a crime .


If it was always in our power to penetrate into the intentions of our enemies , they must necessarily have the same means of making themselves acquainted with our projects , and yet when any of them are discovered we think it just to impute it to the negligence of the minister .


Thus , my lords , every man is inclined to judge with prejudice and partiality .
When we suffer by the prudence of our enemies , we charge our ministers with want of vigilance , without considering , that very often nothing is necessary to elude the most penetrating sagacity , but obstinate silence .


If we inquire into the transactions of past times , shall we find any man , however renowned for his abilities , not sometimes imposed upon by falsehoods , and sometimes betrayed by his own reasonings into measures destructive of the purposes which he endeavoured to promote ?
There is no man of whose penetration higher ideas have been justly formed , or who gave more frequent proofs of an uncommon penetration into futurity than Cromwell  and yet succeeding times have sufficiently discovered the weakness of aggrandizing France by depressing Spain , and we wonder now how so much policy could fall into so gross an errour , as not rather to suffer power to remain in the distant enemy , than transfer it to another equally divided from us by interest , and far more formidable by the situation of his dominions .


Cromwell , my lords , suffered himself to be hurried away by the near prospect of present advantages , and the apprehension of present dangers  and every other man has been , in the same manner , sometimes deluded into a preference of a smaller present advantage , to a greater which was more remote .


Let it not be urged , my lords , that politicks are advanced since the time of Cromwell , and that errours which might then be committed by the wisest administration , are now gross and reproachful  we are to remember that every part of policy has been equally improved , and that if more methods of discovery have been struck out , there have been likewise more arts invented of eluding it .


When , therefore , we inquire into the conduct , or examine the abilities of a minister , we are not to expect that he should appear never to have been deceived , but that he should never be found to have neglected any proper means of information , nor ever to have willingly given up the interest of his country  but we are not to impute to his weakness what is only to be ascribed to the wisdom of those whom he opposed .


If this plea , my lords , is reasonable , it will be necessary for those who support the motion , to prove , not only that the treaty of Vienna was never made , but that the falsehood of the report either was or might have been known by our ministers  otherwise , those who are inclined to retain a favourable opinion of their integrity and abilities , may conclude , that they were either not mistaken , or were led into errour by such delusions as would no less easily have imposed on their accusers , and that by exalting their enemies to their stations , they shall not much consult the advantage of their country .


This motion , therefore , my lords , founded upon no acknowledged , no indisputable facts , nor supported by legal evidence  this motion , which , by appealing to common fame , as the ultimate judge of every man 's actions , may bring every man 's life , or fortune , into danger  this motion , which condemns without hearing , and decides without examining , I can not but reject , and hope your lordships will concur with me .


Lord CARLISLE spoke next , to the following purport : -- My lords , the state of the question before us has , in my opinion , not been rightly apprehended by the noble lord who spoke last , nor is the innocence or guilt of the minister the chief question before us , because a minister may possibly mean well , and yet be , in some particular circumstances , unqualified for his station .


He may not only want the degree of knowledge and ability requisite to make his good intentions effectual , but , my lords , however skilful , sagacious , or diligent , he may be so unfortunate , in some parts of his conduct , as to want the esteem and confidence of the people .


That a very able and honest minister may be misinformed by his intelligence , disappointed by his agents , or baffled by other men of equal capacity and integrity with himself , can not be controverted  but it must surely be owned likewise , that when this has happened so often , and in cases of such importance , as to deprive him entirely of the regard and affection of the people  when he is reduced to intrench himself behind his privileges , to employ all the influence of the crown for his own security , and make it his daily endeavour to create new dependencies , he ought to be pitied and discarded .


That this is the state of the minister whose removal is desired by the motion , can not be denied  the exaltation of his adherents to places and preferments , the noble lord has been so far from questioning , that he has endeavoured to justify it , and has in plain terms inquired , who would have acted otherwise ?


Every man , my lords , would have acted otherwise , whose character had not been blasted by general detestation  every man would have acted otherwise , who preferred the publick good to his own continuance in power  and every man has acted otherwise who has distinguished himself as a friend to the publick .


It is the interest of the nation , my lords , that every office should be filled by that man who is most capable of discharging it , whatever may be his sentiments with regard to the minister  and that his attention should be confined to his employment , rather than distracted by various concerns and opposite relations .
It is , therefore , an injury to the publick , to thrust a skilful commissioner into the senate , or to embarrass an industrious senator with a post or commission .


Yet , my lords , that multitudes have obtained places , who have no acquaintance with the duties of their offices , nor any other pretensions to them , than that they have seats in the other house , and that by distinguishing himself in that assembly , any man may most easily obtain the preferments of the crown , is too obvious for controversy .


This practice , my lords , is a sufficient foundation for the motion  a practice so injurious to the nation , so long continued , and so openly avowed , requires to be vigorously opposed , lest it should become established by long custom , and entangle itself with our constitution .


If the minister , my lords , has made it necessary to employ none but his adherents and blind followers , this necessity is alone a sufficient proof how little he confides in his own prudence or integrity , how apprehensive he is of the censure of the senate , and how desirous of continuing his authority , by avoiding it .
And , surely , my lords , it is our duty , as well as our right , to address the throne , that a minister should be removed who fears the people , since few men fear without hating , and nothing so much contributes to make any man an enemy to his country , as the consciousness that he is universally abhorred .


But , my lords , if this is done by him without necessity , if the general preference of his friends is only the consequence of mistaken judgment , or corrupt gratitude , this address is equally necessary , because the effects are equally pernicious .


When a minister , suspected of ill intentions , is continued in employment , discontent must naturally spread over the nation  and if the end of government be the happiness of the people  if suspicion and jealousy be contrary to a state of happiness  and if this suspicion which generally prevails , this discontent which fills the whole nation , can only be appeased by the removal of the minister  prudence , justice , and the examples of our ancestors , ought to influence us to endeavour that the affairs of the nation may be transferred to such whose greater integrity or wisdom has recommended them to the affection of the people .


In this motion , therefore , we need not be supposed to imply that the minister is either ignorant or corrupt , but that he is disliked by the people , disliked to such a degree , my lords , that it is not safe for his majesty to employ him .


It is , doubtless , our duty , my lords , to guard both the rights of the people , and the prerogatives of the throne , and with equal ardour to remonstrate to his majesty the distresses of his subjects , and his own danger .
We are to hold the balance of the constitution , and neither to suffer the regal power to be overborne by a torrent of popular fury , nor the people to be oppressed by an illegal exertion of authority , or the more insupportable hardships of unreasonable laws .


By this motion , my lords , the happiness of the people , and the security of his majesty , are at once consulted , nor can we suppress so general a clamour without failing equally in our duty to both .


To what , my lords , is the untimely end of so many kings and emperours to be imputed , but to the cowardice or treachery of their counsellors , of those to whom they trusted that intercourse , which is always to be preserved between a monarch and his people ?
Were kings honestly informed of the opinions and dispositions of their subjects , they would never , or , at least rarely , persist in such measures , as , by exasperating the people , tend necessarily to endanger themselves .


It is the happiness of a British monarch , that he has a standing and hereditary council , composed of men who do not owe their advancement to the smiles of caprice , or the intrigues of a court  who are , therefore , neither under the influence of a false gratitude , nor of a servile dependence , and who may convey to the throne the sentiments of the people , without danger , and without fear .
But , my lords , if we are either too negligent , or too timorous to do our duty , how is the condition of our sovereign more safe , or more happy than that of an emperour of Turkey , who is often ignorant of any complaints made against the administration , till he hears the people thundering at the gates of his palace .


Let us , therefore , my lords , whatever may be our opinion of the conduct of the minister , inform his majesty of the discontent of his subjects , since , whether it is just or not , the danger is the same , and whenever any danger threatens the king , we ought either to enable him to oppose , or caution him to avoid it .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke next , to the following effect : -- My lords , I can not but observe in this debate an ambition of popularity , in my opinion not very consistent with the freedom of debate , and the dignity of this assembly , which ought to be influenced by no other motive than the force of reason and truth .


It has been a common method of eluding the efficacy of arguments , to charge the opponent with blind adherence to interest , or corrupt compliance with the directions of a court  nor has it been less frequent to prevent inquiries into publick measures , by representing them as the clamours of faction , the murmurs of disobedience , and the prelude to rebellion .


So necessary , my lords , has it been always thought to be uninfluenced in our examinations by dependence or interest , that the most irrefragable reasons have lost the power of conviction , by the condition and characters of those by whom they were produced  and so much is it expected from innocence and justice to despise all foreign assistance , and to stand the test of inquiry without asking the support of power , that every man has been concluded guilty that has fled for shelter to the throne .


And surely , my lords , if that man 's suffrage is of little weight , who appears determined to subscribe to the dictates of a minister , no greater credit can be assigned to another , who professes himself only the echo of the clamours of the populace .
If it be a proof of a weak cause , and consciousness of misconduct , to apply to the crown for security and protection , it may be accounted an acknowledgment of the insufficiency of arguments , when the people is called in to second them , and they are only to expect success from the violence of multitudes .


That all government is instituted for the happiness of the people , that their interest ought to be the chief care of the legislature , that their complaints ought patiently to be heard , and their grievances speedily redressed , are truths well known , generally acknowledged , and , I hope , always predominant in the mind of every lord in this assembly .
But , that the people can not err , that the voice of fame is to be regarded as an oracle , and every murmur of discontent to be pacified by a change of measures , I have never before heard , or heard it only to disregard it .


True tenderness for the people , my lords , is to consult their advantage , to protect their liberty , and to preserve their virtue  and perhaps examples may be found sufficient to inform us that all these effects are often to be produced by means not generally agreeable to the publick .


It is possible , my lords , for a very small part of the people to form just ideas of the motives of transactions and the tendency of laws .
All negotiations with foreign powers are necessarily complicated with many different interests , and varied by innumerable circumstances , influenced by sudden exigencies , and defeated by unavoidable accidents .
Laws have respect to remote consequences , and involve a multitude of relations which it requires long study to discover .
And how difficult it is to judge of political conduct , or legislative proceedings , may be easily discovered by observing how often the most skilful statesmen are mistaken , and how frequently the laws require to be amended .


If then , my lords , the people judge for themselves on these subjects , they must necessarily determine without knowledge of the questions , and their decisions are then of small authority .
If they receive , implicitly , the dictates of others , and blindly adopt the opinions of those who have gained their favour and esteem , their applauses and complaints are , with respect to themselves , empty sounds , which they utter as the organs of their leaders .
Nor are the desires of the people gratified when their petitions are granted  nor their grievances overlooked when their murmurs are neglected .


As it is no reproach to the people that they can not be the proper judges of the conduct of the government , so neither are they to be censured when they complain of injuries not real , and tremble at the apprehension of severities unintended .
Unjust complaints , my lords , and unreasonable apprehensions , are to be imputed to those who court their regard only to deceive them , and exalt themselves to reputation by rescuing them from grievances that were never felt , and averting dangers that were never near .


He only who makes the happiness of the people his endeavour , loves them with a true affection and a rational tenderness , and he certainly consults their happiness who contributes to still all groundless clamours , and appease all useless apprehensions , who employs his care , not only to preserve their quiet and their liberty , but to secure them from the fear of losing it , who not only promotes the means of happiness , but enables them to enjoy it .


Thus , it appears , my lords , that it is possible to be a friend , at the same time , to the people and the administration , and that no man can more deserve their confidence and applause , than he that dissipates their unreasonable terrours , and contributes to reconcile them to a good government .


That most of the clamours against the present government arise from calumnies and misrepresentations , is apparent from the sanction of the senate , which has been given to all the measures that are charged as crimes upon the administration .


That the army is supported by the consent of the senate , that the senate has approved the convention , and that our taxes are all imposed and continued by the senate , can not be denied .
What then is demanded by those that censure the conduct of publick affairs , but that their opinion should be considered as an overbalance to the wisdom of the senate , that no man should be allowed to speak but as they dictate , nor to vote but as they shall influence them by their rhetorick or example ?


To repeat the particular topicks of accusation , and recapitulate the arguments which have been produced to confute it , would be a tedious and unnecessary labour  unnecessary , because it is well known that they once had the power of convincing this house , and that nothing has since happened to lessen their force , and because many of them now have been already repeated by the noble lords that have opposed the motion .


To search far backward for past errors , and to take advantage of later discoveries in censuring the conduct of any minister , is in a high degree disingenuous and cruel  it is an art which may be easily practised , of perplexing any question , by connecting distant facts , and entangling one period of time with another .


The only candid method of inquiry is to recur back to the state of affairs , as it then appeared , to consider what was openly declared , and what was kept impenetrably secret , what was discoverable by human sagacity , and what was beyond the reach of the most piercing politician .


With regard to the Hanover treaty , it is not , my lords , requisite that we should engage ourselves in a very minute examination  for it was not only not transacted by the right honourable gentleman whose behaviour is the subject of this debate , but can not be proved to have been known by him till it was formally ratified .
If he afterwards approved it either in the council or the senate , he can not justly , how destructive or ridiculous soever that treaty may be thought , be charged with more than his share of the guilt , the bare guilt of a single vote .


But there is one accusation yet more malicious , an accusation not only of crimes which this gentleman did not commit , but which have not yet been committed , an accusation formed by prying into futurity , and exaggerating misfortunes which are yet to come , and which may probably be prevented .
Well may any man , my lords , think himself in danger , when he hears himself charged not with high crimes and misdemeanours , not with accumulative treason , but with misconduct of publick affairs , past , present , and future .


The only charge against this gentleman , which seems to relate more to him than to any other man engaged in the administration , is the continuance of the harbour of Dunkirk , which , says the noble duke , he must be acquainted with as commissioner of the treasury  but if the title of first commissioner be denied , if his authority be but the same with that of his associates , whence comes it , my lords , that he is more particularly accused than they ?
Why is his guilt supposed greater if his power is only equal ?


But , my lords , I believe it will appear , that no guilt has been contracted on this account , and that Dunkirk was always intended , even by those that demanded the demolition of it , to continue a harbour for small trading vessels , and that if larger ever arrived from thence , they lay at a distance from the shore , and were loaded by small vessels from the town .


With regard to other affairs , my lords , they were all transacted by the council , not by his direction , but with his concurrence  and how it is consistent with justice to single him out for censure , I must desire the noble lords to show who approve the motion .


If the people , my lords , have been , by misrepresentations industriously propagated , exasperated against him , if the general voice of the nation condemns him , we ought more cautiously to examine his conduct , lest we should add strength to prejudice too powerful already , and instead of reforming the errours , and regulating the heat of the people , inflame their discontent and propagate sedition .


The utmost claim of the people is to be admitted as accusers , and sometimes as evidence , but they have no right to sit as judges , and to make us the executioners of their sentence  and as this gentleman has yet been only condemned by those who have not the opportunities of examining his conduct , nor the right of judging him , I can not agree to give him up to punishment .


Lord HALIFAX spoke next , in substance as follows : -- My lords , though I do not conceive the people infallible , yet I believe that in questions like this they are seldom in the wrong , for this is a question not of argument but of fact  of fact discoverable , not by long deductions and accurate ratiocinations , but by the common powers of seeing and feeling .


That it is difficult to know the motives of negotiations , and the effects of laws , and that it requires long study and intense meditation to discover remote consequences , is indubitably true .
And , with regard to the people in general , it can not be denied , that neither their education qualifies them , nor their employments allow them to be much versed in such inquiries .


But , my lords , to refer effects to their proper causes , and to observe , when consequences break forth , from whence they proceed , is no such arduous task .
The people of the lowest class may easily feel that they are more miserable this year than the last , and may inquire and discover the reason of the aggravation of their misery  they may know that the army is increased , or our trade diminished  that the taxes are heavier , and penal laws become more grievous .


Nor is it less easy for them to discover that these calamities are not brought upon them by the immediate hand of heaven , or the irresistible force of natural causes  that their towns are not ruined by an invasion , nor their trade confined by a pestilence  they may then easily collect , that they are only unhappy by the misconduct of their governours  they may assign their infelicity to that cause , as the only remaining cause that is adequate to the effect .


If it be granted , my lords , that they may be mistaken in their reasoning , it must be owned , that they are not mistaken without probabilities on their side : it is probable that the ministry must injure the publick interest when it decays without any other visible cause  it is still more probable , when it appears that among those whose station enables them to enter into national inquiries , every man imputes his calamities to the minister , who is not visibly dependent on his favour .
It becomes more probable , yet , when it appears that it is the great business of the minister to multiply dependencies , to list accomplices , and to corrupt his judges .


At least , my lords , if it be granted , which , surely , can not be denied , that the people may be sensible of their own miseries , it is their part to declare their sufferings , and to apply to this house for relief , and it is our business to discover the authors of them , and bring them to punishment .


That the people are very loud and importunate in their complaints , is daily evident  nor is it less apparent , that their complaints are just  if , therefore , their miseries must have an author , let the defenders of this gentleman point out the man whom they may more properly accuse .


But , my lords , nothing is more evident , than that the crimes and the criminal are equally known , that there is one man predominant in his majesty 's councils , and that it has long been the practice of that man at once to oppress and ridicule the people , to plunder them , and set them at defiance .


Nothing is more known than that this man pretends to a superiour knowledge , and exerts a superiour power in the management of the publick revenues , and that they have been so ill managed for many years , that the expenses of peace have been almost equal to those of a most vigorous and extensive war .


Nothing is more probable , than that most of the foreign negotiations are conducted by his direction , nor more certain , than that they have generally tended only to make us contemptible .


That the excise was projected in his own head , that it was recommended by him upon his own conviction , and pressed upon the legislature by his influence , can not be questioned  and if this were his only crime , if this were the only scheme of oppression that ever he planned out , it is such a declaration of war upon the publick liberty , such an attack of our natural and constitutional rights , as was never , perhaps , pardoned by any nation .


Nor is it less notorious , that the late infamous convention was transacted by one of his own dependents , that he palliated or concealed the losses of our merchants , that he opposed the declaration of war , and has since obstructed its operations .


On this occasion , my lords , it may be useful to remark the apparent partiality of this gentleman 's vindicators , who declare , that measures are not to be censured as imprudent , only because they are unsuccessful , and yet when other instances of his conduct fall under our examination , think it a sufficient defence to exclaim against the unreasonableness of judging before the event .


To deny that , in the conduct both of civil and military affairs , he has obtained , I know not by what means , an authority superiour to that of any other man , an authority irresistible , uncontroulable , and regal , is to oppose not only common fame , but daily experience .
If as commissioner of the treasury he has no more power than any of his associates , whence is it , that to oppose or censure him , to doubt of his infallibility , to suspect his integrity , or to obstruct his influence , is a crime punished with no lighter penalty than forfeiture of employment , as appears , my lords , from the late dismission of a gentleman , against whom nothing can be alleged but an obstinate independence and open disregard of this arbitrary minister .


But happy would it be , my lords , for this nation , if he endeavoured not to extend his authority beyond the treasury or the court  if he would content himself with tyrannising over those whose acceptance of salaries and preferments has already subjected them to his command , without attempting to influence elections , or to direct the members of the other house .


How much the influence of the crown has operated upon all publick councils since the advancement of this gentleman , how zealously it has been supported , and how industriously extended , is unnecessary to explain , since what is seen or felt by almost every man in the kingdom can not reasonably be supposed unknown to your lordships .


Nothing can be more contrary to the true notion of the British constitution , than to imagine , that by such measures his majesty 's real interest is advanced .
The true interest , my lords , of every monarch , is to please the people , and the only way of pleasing Britons , is to preserve their liberties , their reputation , and their commerce .
Every attempt to extend the power of the crown beyond the limits prescribed by our laws , must in effect make it weaker , by diverting the only source of its strength , the affection of his subjects .


It is , therefore , my opinion , my lords , that we ought to agree to this motion , as a standing memorial not only of our regard for the nation , but of our adherence to our sovereign  that his councils may be no longer influenced by that man whose pernicious advice , and unjustifiable conduct , has added new hopes and new strength to his enemies , impoverished and exasperated his subjects , inflamed the discontent of the seditious , and almost alienated the affection of the loyal .


The bishop of SALISBURY spoke next , to the following purport : -- My lords , after all the exaggerations of the errours , and all the representations of the malconduct of the right honourable gentleman  after the most affecting rhetorick , and the most acute inquiries , nothing has appeared of weight sufficient to prevail with me to agree to the present motion  a motion , if not of an unprecedented , yet of a very extraordinary kind , which may extend in its consequences to futurity , and be , perhaps , more dangerous to innocence than guilt .


I can not yet discover any proof sufficient to convict him of having usurped the authority of first minister , or any other power than that accidental influence which every man has , whose address or services have procured him the favour of his sovereign .


The usurpation , my lords , of regal power must be made evident by somewhat more than general assertions , must appear from some publick act like that of one of the prelates left regent of the kingdom by Richard the first , who , as soon as the king was gone too far to return , in the first elevations of his heart , began his new authority by imprisoning his colleague .


To charge this gentleman with the dismission of any of his colleagues , can , after the strongest aggravations , rise no higher than to an accusation of having advised his majesty to dismiss him , and even that , my lords , stands , at present , unsupported by evidence  nor could it , however uncontestably proved , discover either wickedness or weakness , or show any other authority than every man would exercise , if he were able to attain it .


If he had discharged this gentleman by his own authority , if he had transacted singly any great affair to the disadvantage of the publick , if he had imposed either upon the king or the senate by false representations , if he had set the laws at defiance , and openly trampled on our constitution , and if by these practices he had exalted himself above the reach of a legal prosecution , it had been worthy of the dignity of this house , to have overleaped the common boundaries of custom , to have neglected the standing rules of procedure , and to have brought so contemptuous and powerful an offender to a level with the rest of his fellow-subjects by expeditious and vigorous methods , to have repressed his arrogance , broken his power , and overwhelmed him at once by the resistless weight of an unanimous censure .


But , my lords , we have in the present case no provocations from crimes either openly avowed , or evidently proved  and certainly no incitement from necessity to exert the power of the house in any extraordinary method of prosecution .
We may punish whenever we can convict , and convict whenever we can obtain evidence  let us not , therefore , condemn any man unheard , nor punish any man uncondemned .


The duke of BEDFORD spoke next , in substance as follows : -- My lords , it is easy to charge the most blameless and gentle procedure with injustice and severity , but it is not easy to support such an accusation without confounding measures widely different , and disguising the nature of things with fallacious misrepresentations .


Nothing is more evident than that neither condemnation nor punishment is intended by the motion before us , which is only to remove from power a man who has no other claim to it than the will of his master , and who , as he had not been injured by never obtaining it , can not justly complain that it is taken from him .


The motion , my lords , is so far from inflicting punishment , that it confers rewards , it leaves him in the possession of immense wealth , however accumulated , and enables him to leave that office in security , from which most of his predecessors have been precipitated by national resentment , or senatorial prosecution .


There is no censure , my lords , made of his conduct , no charge of weakness , or suspicion of dishonesty , nor can any thing be equitably inferred from it , than that in the opinion of this house his majesty may probably be served by some other person , more to the satisfaction of the British nation .


Though it is not just to punish any man without examination , or to censure his conduct merely because it has been unpleasing or unsuccessful  though it is not reasonable that any man should forfeit what he possesses in his own right , without a crime , yet it is just to withdraw favours only to confer them on another more deserving  it is just in any man to withhold his own , only to preserve his right , or obviate an injurious prescription , and it is , therefore , just to advise such a conduct whenever it appears necessary to those who have the right of offering advice .


To advise his majesty , my lords , is not only our right but our duty  we are not only justifiable in practising , but criminal in neglecting it .
That we should declare our apprehensions of any impending danger , and our disapprobation of publick misconduct , is expected both by our sovereign and the people , and let us not , by omitting such warnings , lull the nation and our sovereign into a dangerous security , and , from tenderness to one man , prolong or increase the miseries of our country , and endanger or destroy the honour of our sovereign .


Lord HERVEY spoke next , in effect as follows : -- My lords , this is surely a day destined by the noble lords who defend the motion , for the support of paradoxical assertions , for the exercise of their penetration , and ostentation of their rhetorick  they have attempted to maintain the certainty of common fame in opposition to daily observation  the existence of a sole minister in contradiction to the strongest evidence  and having by these gradations arrived at the highest degree of controversial temerity , are endeavouring to make it appear that the publick censure of the house of lords is no punishment .


If we take the liberty , my lords , of using known words in a new sense , in a meaning reserved to ourselves only , it will , indeed , be difficult to confute , as it will be impossible to understand us  but if punishment be now to be understood as implying the same idea which has hitherto been conveyed by it , it will not be easy to show that a man thus publickly censured is not severely punished , and , if his crimes are not clearly proved , punished in opposition to law , to reason , and to justice .


It has been hitherto imagined , my lords , that no punishment is heavier than that of infamy  and shame has , by generous minds , been avoided at the hazard of every other misery .
That such a censure as is proposed by the motion , must irreparably destroy the reputation of the person against whom it is directed , that it must confirm the reports of his enemies , impair the esteem of his friends , mark him out to all Europe as unworthy of his sovereign 's favour , and represent him to latest posterity as an enemy to his country , is indisputably certain .


These , my lords , are the evident consequences of the address moved for by the noble lord  and , if such consequences are not penal , it will be no longer in our power to enforce our laws by sanctions of terrour .


To condemn a man unheard , is an open and flagrant violation of the first law of justice , but it is still a wider deviation from it to punish a man unaccused  no crime has been charged upon this gentleman proportioned to the penalty proposed by the motion , and the charge that has been produced is destitute of proof .


Let us , therefore , my lords , reverence the great laws of reason and justice , let us preserve our high character and prerogative of judges , without descending to the low province of accusers and executioners  let us so far regard our reputation , our liberty , and our posterity , as to reject the motion .


[ Several other lords spoke in this debate , which lasted eleven hours  at length the question was put , and , on a division , carried in the negative .
Content , 59 .
Not content , 108 . ]


After the determination of the foregoing question , the duke of MARLBOROUGH rose up , and spoke as follows : -- My lords , though your patience must undoubtedly be wearied by the unusual length of this day 's debate , a debate protracted , in my opinion , not by the difficulty of the question , but by the obstinacy of prejudice , the ardour of passion , and the desire of victory  yet , I doubt not but the regard which this assembly has always paid to the safety and happiness of the state , will incline you to support the fatigue of attention a little longer , and to hear with your usual impartiality another motion .


The proposition which I am about to lay down , my lords , is not such as can admit of controversy  it is such a standing principle as was always acknowledged , even by those who have deviated from it .
Such a known truth as never was denied , though it appears sometimes to have been forgotten .


But , my lords , as it never can be forgotten , without injury to particular persons , and danger to the state in general , it can not be too frequently recollected , or too firmly established  it ought not only to be tacitly admitted , but publickly declared , since no man 's fortune , liberty , or life , can be safe , where his judges shall think themselves at liberty to act upon any other principle .
I therefore move , `` That any attempt to inflict any kind of punishment on any person without allowing him an opportunity to make his defence , or without any proof of any crime or misdemeanour committed by him , is contrary to natural justice , the fundamental laws of this realm , and the ancient established usage of the senate , and is a high infringement of the liberties of the subject . ''


He was seconded by the duke of DEVONSHIRE : -- My lords , though the motion made by the noble duke is of such a kind , that no opposition can be expected or feared , yet I rise up to second it , lest it should be imagined that what can not be rejected is yet unwillingly admitted .


That where this maxim is not allowed and adhered to , rights and liberties are empty sounds , is uncontestably evident  if this principle be forsaken , guilt and innocence are equally secure , all caution is vain , and all testimony useless .
Caprice will , in our courts , supply the place of reason , and all evidence must give way to malice , or to favour .


I hope , therefore , my lords , that your regard to justice , to truth , and to your own safety , will influence you to confirm this great and self-evident principle by a standing resolution , that may not only restrain oppression in the present age , but direct the judiciary proceedings of our successors .


Lord LOVEL rose next , and spoke as follows : -- My lords , liberty and justice must always support each other , they can never long flourish apart  every temporary expedient that can be contrived to preserve or enlarge liberty by means arbitrary and oppressive , forms a precedent which may , in time , be made use of to violate or destroy it .
Liberty is in effect suspended whenever injustice is practised  for what is liberty , my lords , but the power of doing right without fear , without control , and without danger .


But , my lords , if any man may be condemned unheard , if judgment may precede evidence , what safety or what confidence can integrity afford ?
It is in vain that any man means well , and acts prudently  it is even in vain that he can prove the justice and prudence of his conduct .


By liberty , my lords , can never be meant the privilege of doing wrong without being accountable , because liberty is always spoken of as happiness , or one of the means to happiness , and happiness and virtue can not be separated .
The great use of liberty must , therefore , be to preserve justice from violation  justice , the great publick virtue , by which a kind of equality is diffused over the whole society , by which wealth is restrained from oppression , and inferiority preserved from servitude .


Liberty , general liberty , must imply general justice  for wherever any part of a state can be unjust with impunity , the rest are slaves .
That to condemn any man unheard is oppressive and unjust , is beyond controversy demonstrable , and that no such power is claimed by your lordships will , I hope , appear from your resolutions .


Lord GOWER spoke next : -- My lords , to the principle laid down by those noble lords , I have no objection , and concur with them in hoping that all our proceedings will contribute to establish it  but why it should be confirmed by a formal resolution , why the house should solemnly declare their assent to a maxim which it would be madness to deny , it is beyond my penetration to discover .


Though the noble lord 's position can not be controverted , yet his motion , if it is designed to imply any censure of the proceedings of this day , may reasonably be rejected , and that some censure is intended we may conjecture , because no other reason can be given why it was not made at some other time .


Lord HALIFAX then rose : -- My lords , that a censure is intended , will , I suppose , not be denied , and that such a censure is unjust must doubtless be the opinion of all those who are supposed to have incurred it , and it will , therefore , not be wondered that the motion is opposed by them , as indecent and calumnious : late as it is , my lords , I will not , for my part , suffer such an indignity without opposition , and shall think my conscience and my honour require , that I should not be overborne by perseverance or by numbers , but that I should , if I can not convince the noble lords by argument , of the impropriety of the motion , record my reasons against it , which may , perhaps , be more candidly received by posterity .


Lord TALBOT spoke to this effect : -- My lords , it is not without indignation that I hear a motion so injurious to my own honour , and to that of the noble lords who have concurred with me in the last debate , nor without contempt that I observed the motion confounded with the positions contained in it  the low subtilty of such conduct is no less to be despised than the malice to be abhorred .


Fifty-nine lords are here branded as strangers , or enemies to the first principle of judicial equity , for doing what will entitle them to the general applause of every man in the kingdom that has the full possession of his understanding , or the free use of his senses  of every man that can distinguish truth , or feel oppression .


They have endeavoured to rescue their country from the rapine of pensioners and the tyranny of an army , from perpetual taxes , and useless expenses  they have attempted to expose the errours of arrogant ignorance , and to depress the power of greatness , founded on corruption , and swelling beyond legal restraints .


That for such attempts they are vilified and reproached , is not to be observed without indignation and astonishment  astonishment which nothing could abate but the recollection of the situation of those lords who have united to promote so unjust a censure .


Let us , my lords , consider the circumstances of the three noble lords by whom this motion has been made and supported , let us take a view of their conduct , and consider the visible motives to which it may be ascribed , their places , their dependence --


Lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke next , in substance as follows : -- My lords , I rise thus abruptly to preserve that order and decency which is essential to publick councils , and particularly suitable to the dignity of this assembly , which can only become a scene of tumult and confusion by such methods of debate , and lose that respect which it has hitherto preserved , not only by the justice of its determinations , but by the solemn grandeur of its procedure .


The motion , my lords , is allowed to contain nothing but what every man avows in speculation , and observes , or ought to observe , in publick transactions , and yet those that offer and support it are represented as abettors of oppression , and instruments of tyranny .


It is surely wonderful , my lords , that those who are solicitous for the preservation of their own honour , and so diligent to obviate the most remote reflection that may glance upon it , should not remember , that the same delicacy may raise in others the same resentment , when their reputation is openly attacked  and that while they are asserting the right of the minority to an exemption from censure , they shall not allow the greater number at least an equal claim to the same privilege .


Lord TALBOT then resumed : -- My lords , whether any thing has escaped from me that deserves such severe animadversions , your lordships must decide .
For what I might intend to say , since by the interruption of that noble lord I was hindered from proceeding , I hope I shall not be accountable .


Not that I acknowledge myself to have asserted any thing either contrary to law , or to the privileges of the house , or inconsistent with the character of an independent lord , a character which I shall always endeavour to preserve , and which I will not forfeit for the smiles of a court , the dignity of high employment , or the affluence of a pension .


Nor , my lords , whenever the necessities of my country require that I should speak my sentiments with freedom , will I be awed into silence and submission , but will set any power at defiance that shall dare to restrain me .


I pretend not , my lords , to be always in the right , I claim no other merit than that of meaning well  and when I am convinced , after proper examination , that I am engaged on the side of truth , I will trample on that insolence that shall command me to suppress my sentiments .


When I reflect , my lords , on the distresses of my country , when I observe the security and arrogance of those whom I consider as the authors of the publick miseries , I can not always contain my resentment  I may , perhaps , sometimes start out into unbecoming transports , and speak in terms not very ceremonious of such abandoned , such detestable -- But as this is , perhaps , not the language of the house , I shall endeavour to repress it , and hope that the bounds of decency have never been so far transgressed by me that I should be exposed to the censure of your lordships .


Lord ABINGDON next rose , and said : -- My lords , the present motion is undoubtedly just , but by no means necessary , or particularly adapted to the present time .
It contains a general principle , uncontested , and established  a principle which this assembly has never denied , and from which I know not that it has ever departed .


As there is , therefore , no particular necessity of confirming it by a new resolution , and as the present time seems less proper than any other , I can not but declare my opinion , that to resume it at some other time will be more prudent , than to give the lords , who think their conduct censured , any occasion of resentment or discontent .


Lord CARTERET spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , the maxim laid down in the present motion , is in itself incontestable , and so far from any inconsistency with the former , that as there was no reason for making , there is , in my opinion , none for opposing it  as it may at any time be made , it may at any time be properly passed .
And I hope that our unanimity on this occasion will show that truth , however unseasonably advanced , will , in this house , be always received .


But , lest the noble lords who have opposed the motion , should think their honour engaged in continuing the opposition , I take the liberty , my lords , to move that the previous question may be put .


[ Other lords spoke on each side  at last the previous question was put by the president , who demanded , `` Is it your lordships ' pleasure , that the question be now put ?
Those lords who are for it , say , Content : those who are against it , say , Not content . ''
There was , accordingly , a cry of both  after which the president declared , `` the contents have it  '' and some lords replying , `` the non-contents have it , '' his lordship said , `` the non-contents must go below the bar : '' which is the manner of dividing the house .
Those who remained being told in their seats , and those who went out being told at coming in again , there were Content , 81  Not content , 54 : so that the resolution moved for , passed without a division . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , FEB. 24 , 1740-1 .


[ DEBATE ON CLEANSING THE CITY OF WESTMINSTER . ]


Lord TYRCONNEL made a motion for bringing in a bill for the better cleansing and paving the streets of Westminster , and the liberties thereof  in support of which motion he spoke to the following purpose : --


Sir , though the grievance which I am about to lay before the house is not of the most formidable or dangerous kind , yet as it is such as grows every day greater , and such as every day endangers the lives of thousands , I hope it will not be thought useless or improper to propose it to the consideration of this assembly , to offer my thoughts on the methods by which it may be most easily removed , and to endeavour to incite others to the same considerations .


It is impossible , sir , to come to this assembly , or to return from it without observations on the present condition of the streets of Westminster  observations forced upon every man , however inattentive , or however engrossed by reflections of a different kind .


The warmest zeal for publick happiness , the most anxious vigilance against general dangers , must , I believe , sometimes give way to objects of immediate , though of less importance , nor will the most publick-spirited senators deny , that they have often been in the streets alarmed with obstructions , or shocked with nuisances .


The filth , sir , of some parts of the town , and the inequality and ruggedness of others , can not but in the eyes of foreigners disgrace our nation , and incline them to imagine us a people , not only without delicacy , but without government , a herd of barbarians , or a colony of hottentots .


The most disgusting part of the character given by travellers , of the most savage nations , is their neglect of cleanliness , of which , perhaps , no part of the world affords more proofs , than the streets of the British capital  a city famous for wealth , and commerce , and plenty , and for every other kind of civility and politeness , but which abounds with such heaps of filth , as a savage would look on with amazement .


If that be allowed which is generally believed , that putrefaction and stench are the causes of pestilential distempers , the removal of this grievance may be pressed from motives of far greater weight than those of delicacy and pleasure  and I might solicit the timely care of this assembly for the preservation of inuumerable multitudes , and intreat those , who are watching against slight misfortunes , to unite their endeavours with mine , to avert the greatest and most dreadful of calamities .


Not to dwell , sir , upon dangers , which may , perhaps , be thought only imaginary , I hope that it will be at least considered , how much the present neglect of the pavement is detrimental to every carriage , whether of trade , or pleasure , or convenience , and that those who have allowed so much of their attention to petitions , relating to the roads of the kingdom , the repair of some of which is almost every session thought of importance sufficient to produce debates in this house , will not think the streets of the capital alone unworthy of their regard .


That the present neglect of cleansing and paving the streets is such as ought not to be borne , that the passenger is every where either surprised and endangered by unexpected chasms , or offended or obstructed by mountains of filth , is well known to every one that has passed a single day in this great city  and that this grievance is without remedy is a sufficient proof that no magistrate has , at present power to remove it  for every man 's private regard to his own ease and safety , would incite him to exert his authority on this occasion .


I humbly propose , therefore , that a bill may be brought into the house , to enable his majesty 's justices of peace for the liberties of Westminster , to inspect the publick ways of this city , and punish the neglect of cleansing and paving them  or that a new officer be appointed , and vested with full authority for the same purpose .


Mr. SANDYS spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , I believe the grievance , so much complained of by the right honourable member , is not difficult to be removed without a new act of the legislature , being , perhaps , more properly to be imputed to the negligence of the justices , than a defect of their authority  for they have already sufficient power to regulate this disorder : and I may be allowed to hope , sir , that they do not want leisure to observe it , for their number is so great , that if we suppose them to be wholly engaged by the common business of their office , a foreigner would have occasion of reproaching us with defects more important than want of delicacy , and might justly censure us as a people corrupt beyond the common rate of human wickedness , a nation divided only into two classes , magistrates and criminals .


But they , in reality , abound so much among us , that most of them are only nominal magistrates , vested with authority which they never exert , or exert to bad purposes , and which it were well if they were obliged to employ in the real service of their country , by superintending the paviers and the scavengers .


For this reason it is unnecessary to erect a new officer , as an inspector of our streets , since every office that is not necessary is pernicious .
Were the consequences of this grievance such as they have been represented , I should , perhaps , willingly erect a new office , though I should not be surprised to hear the wisest man declare rather for a pestilence than an increase of officers .


As I neither think the grievance insupportable , nor the methods proposed for removing it necessary or proper , I declare myself against the motion .


Lord GAGE spoke in the following manner : -- Sir , as the grievance can not be denied to be real , and the motion , therefore , may reasonably be imagined to have been made without any other intention than of benefiting the publick by an useful law , I can not discover any sufficient reason for a rejection so peremptory and contemptuous .


That every man is disgusted , and almost every man daily endangered in our streets , has not been denied  nor will any man , I suppose , question what , if he has not yet experienced it , he may , perhaps , be fully convinced of , in his next visit or excursion .


Those evils , which every man feels , though slight , are worthy of the attention of the legislature  and that danger that threatens multitudes , though distant , ought to be averted : for a small disorder , like a small expense , when it extends to multitudes , becomes a national affair .


But though this motion may , perhaps , be liable to some objections , there is , certainly , no such absurdity to be found in it , as may justify us in rejecting it without examination  to reject a motion when it is first offered , is a proof of prejudice , next to that of rejecting it unheard  it is to determine a question , before it is discussed , or can be fully understood .


Mr. SANDYS replied , in substance as follows : -- Sir , I can not but differ very widely in opinion from the right honourable member that spoke last , with regard to the propriety of opposing a motion when it is first made  a practice , which I can by no means think inconsistent with either decency or prudence , and which would , perhaps , be of use to the publick , if it was more frequent .


When any motion is made , it is subjected to the consideration of this assembly , and every member is at full liberty to examine and discuss it .
If it appears to deserve farther attention , it may be admitted , but if the subject be either improper or unseasonable , or the measures proposed injudicious or dangerous , it is then to be rejected  and if it is at last to be rejected , it is apparent that no time ought to be thrown away upon it .


The hours , and days , and weeks , that have been improfitably spent upon bills which after all our endeavours could not be passed  the delays of real benefits to the publick , which have been produced by long pursuits of shadowy advantages , have inclined me to a more expeditious method of proceeding , and determined me speedily to reject what I can not hope to amend .


[ The question being put , passed in the negative , 142 against 109 . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , FEB. 27 , 1740-1 .


DEBATE ON THE SECOND READING OF A BILL TO PREVENT INCONVENIENCIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE OF SHIPS .


The bill being read , sir John BARNARD spoke thus : -- Sir , there can not be brought before this house any questions more difficult in themselves , more entangled with a multiplicity of relations , or more perplexed with an endless diversity of circumstances , than those which relate to commercial affairs  affairs on which the most experienced often disagree , and on which the most sagacious may deceive themselves with erroneous conjectures .


There are no questions , sir , which require so much personal knowledge of the subject to which they relate , nor is there any subject with which so few gentlemen in this house have had opportunities of being acquainted .
There are no questions , sir , which their variety of relations to different persons exposes to be so easily misrepresented without detection , nor any in which the opposition of particular interests so much incites a false representation .
In all these cases , deceit is easy , and there is a strong temptation to deceive .


Nor are these questions , sir , always perplexed by intentional fraud , or false assertions , of which they that utter them are themselves conscious .


Those who deceive us , do not always suppress any truth of which they are convinced , nor set facts before us in any other light , than that in which themselves behold them  they for the most part err with an honest intention , and propagate no mistakes but those which they have themselves admitted .


Of this kind , sir , are , doubtless , the measures proposed in the bill before us , which those by whom they are promoted may easily think to be of benefit to the publick , but which , I believe , will appear the result of imperfect views , and partial consideration .


The great and fundamental errour , sir , of the patrons of this bill , seems to be an opinion that the practice of insuring is not known to other nations , nor can be carried on in any other place  and from this principle they deduce consequences , which , if they were inevitably certain , might easily influence us to an immediate approbation of the bill , as necessary to secure our commerce , and distress our enemies .


They conclude , sir , with sufficient justness , that very few merchants would hazard their fortunes in long voyages or distant commerce , or expose themselves to the dangers of war , without the security which insurances afford them  and having persuaded themselves that such security is to be obtained from no other nation , they imagine that we might , by prohibiting it , confine all the foreign vessels in their ports , and destroy , by one resolution , the trade of both our rivals and our enemies .


That our East India company may desire the ratification of this bill , I can not deny , because they might , perhaps , receive from it some temporary advantage by the short inconveniencies which those whom they consider as the enemies of their commerce would feel from it .
They may desire it , because the experiment , if it fails , as it must , can not injure them  and if it succeeds , may produce great advantages to them : they may wish it , because they will feel the immediate benefit , and the detriment will fall upon others .


I shall not inquire whether our merchants are inclined to look with malevolence on all those who cultivate the same branches of commerce with themselves , though they have neither the violation of natural rights , nor the infringement of national treaties , to complain of .
I should be unwilling to suspect a British merchant , whose acquaintance with the constitution of his own country ought to show him the value of liberty , who ought to be above narrow schemes , by the knowledge which his profession enables him to gain , of a desire to encroach upon the rights of others , or to engross the general benefits of nature  and shall only observe , that several other nations can plead a claim to the East India trade , a claim of equal validity with our own  that the Danes have their settlement there , and that the Portuguese discovered the way to those regions of wealth , from which some , perhaps , are inclined to exclude them .


But nothing is more vain than to attempt to exclude them by refusing to ensure their ships , because the opinion that they can be insured by no other nation is entirely without foundation .
There are at this time offices of insurance along the whole coasts of the midland sea , among the Dutch , and even among the French .
Nothing can debar any nation from the trade of insurance but the want of money  and that money is not wanted by foreigners for this purpose , appears from the great sums which they have deposited in our funds .


That this trade is now carried on chiefly by this nation , though not solely , is incontestable  but what can be inferred from that , but that we ought not to obstruct our own gain  that we ought not to make a law to deprive ourselves of that advantage of which either favourable accidents or our own sagacity have put us in possession .


For this reason it appears that it would not contribute to the wealth of the publick to debar us from insuring the ships even of those with whom we are at war , for it is always to be remembered that they will receive no detriment from such prohibitions , nor will feel any other consequence from them than a necessity of transferring to some other nation the profit which we receive from it .


What the profit is which arises to the nation from the trade of insurance it is not possible exactly to determine , but that the trade is really advantageous may be reasonably conceived , because after many years ' experience it is diligently followed , and a law was never necessary to prohibit the pursuit of a business by which nothing was to be gained .
But could the gain of the insurer be a doubtful point , there is a certain advantage to the nation by the money paid for commission , brokerage , stamps , and the credit of the premium deposited here .


I might add , sir , another considerable sum yearly arising to the government from the additional letters , occasioned by this trade , which increase the revenues of the post-office , without any deduction for additional charge .


That the loss of this profit , and the gain of insuring , will ensue upon the ratification of this bill , can not be denied  nor does it appear , that this loss will be counterbalanced by any advantage that will be gained over our rivals or our enemies .


Whether this bill , sir , would produce to the merchants of that city by which it is promoted , the advantages which they expect from it , or remove any of the grievances of which they complain , I am not able positively to determine  but know , that it is not uncommon for merchants , as well as other men , to confound private with publick grievances , and to imagine their own interest the interest of the nation .


With regard , sir , to the practice of insuring , interest or no interest , as the term is , when an imaginary value is put upon the ship or cargo , often much above its real worth , it can not be denied , that some opportunities may be given by it for wicked practices .
But there will always be circumstances in which there can be no security against frauds , but common faith  nor do I see how we can secure the insurers against the possibility of being defrauded .


I can not , indeed , discover , sir , how this method of insuring can be prevented  for how can the value of a cargo be estimated , which is to be collected in a long voyage , at different ports , and where the success of the adventurers often depends upon lucky accidents , which are , indeed , always hoped for , but seldom happen .
An imaginary value must , therefore , be fixed upon , when the ship leaves the port  because the success of that voyage can not be foreknown , and the contracting parties may be safely trusted to set that value , without any law to direct or restrain them .


If the merchants are oppressed by any peculiar inconveniencies , and can find means of redressing them without injuring the publick commerce , any proposal for that purpose ought to be favourably received  but as the bill now before us proposes general restraints , and proposes to remove grievances which are not felt , by remedies , which those upon whom they are to operate , do not approve , I think it ought not to be referred to a committee , but rejected .


Mr. SOUTHWELL spoke next , in terms to this purpose : -- Sir , when I first proposed this bill to the house , I lamented the absence of that honourable gentleman , from whose discussions and arguments I expected great information  and for whose judgment , in all commercial questions , I have the highest esteem , as his penetration not only enables him to discover the consequences of methods which have not yet been tried , but as his extensive acquaintance with many branches of trade , can not but have informed him of the success of many expedients tried , as well in other nations as our own , for the advancement of it .


Trade , sir , is a subject , of which it has been justly observed , that very few gentlemen have attained knowledge sufficient to qualify themselves to judge of the propriety of any new regulation  and I can not but confess , that I have no uncommon skill in these questions .
What I have to offer on this occasion , has been suggested to me , not so much by my own observations , as by the intelligence which I have very industriously sought , and by which , as I endeavoured to inquire of those whose opinion was least likely to be perverted by their interest , I hope I have not been misled .


The merchants , sir , to whom it has been my fortune to apply , have generally concurred in the opinion that the present practice of insuring is prejudicial to our commerce , nor have I found any disagreement between my constituents and the traders of this great metropolis .


I am unwilling to imagine that there can be any evil for which the wisdom of this assembly can not discover a remedy , and am , therefore , of opinion , that if the grievance is real , some expedient may be discovered for removing it  and that it is real , I can not but be convinced by the declarations of so many men , who can have no interest in complaining when they suffer nothing , and whose known abilities exempt them from the suspicion of imputing any part of their uneasiness to a cause which can not produce it .


The bill before us , sir , requires , in my opinion , some amendments , and in its present state might , perhaps , produce more detriment than advantage  but since it is necessary at least to attempt something for the relief of men so useful to this nation , it appears to me necessary to form a committee , and to deliberate on this subject with more attention .


Mr. LOCKWOOD spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , though I am not of opinion that the bill in its present state ought to be passed into a law , yet I am far from thinking it so imperfect as not easily to be amended , and , therefore , am desirous that it should be considered in a committee .


I have not , indeed , sir , often observed , that bills injudiciously drawn up at first have received great improvements from a second consideration , and have found it more easy to form a new bill , than to make alterations in one that is laid before us  for some original errour will commonly remain , and the sentiments of different men , pursuing different views , can seldom be modelled into one consistent scheme .
But I am far from considering this bill as one of those that can not be amended , for I can discover but few objections to the regulations proposed in it , and those not relating to any of the essential parts , but slight and circumstantial , such as will easily be removed , or , perhaps , answered .


The grievance , sir , for which this bill proposes a remedy , is so generally known , and so universally lamented , that , I believe , there is not any thing more worthy of the attention of the legislature than an inquiry into the cause of it , and the proper method of redressing it .


In our inquiry into the causes of this obstruction of trade , I am of opinion , sir , that the practice of insuring , interest or no interest , will appear to be the foundation of this general uneasiness  it will be found a practice of so natural a tendency to fraud , and so easily susceptible of dishonest artifices , that I believe every member of this house will desire its suppression .


To confirm my assertion , sir , and illustrate the question before us , I shall mention some particular instances of fraud to which this custom has given occasion  of fraud so evident and so detestable that it can not be related without indignation .


The Royal George was a large ship belonging to the South sea company , which , having been a voyage to Vera Cruz , put in at Jamaica in her return  and being there refitted to proceed on her voyage homewards , set sail , and came within a week 's sailing of the port , when , upon a sudden , the officers entered into a consultation , and determined to go back a month 's voyage to Antigua  for what reason , sir , may easily be guessed , when it was told that a ship was insured upon a supposed value of sixty thousand pounds .


This resolution , sir , was no sooner formed , than orders were given to change the course and steer to Antigua , in opposition to all the remonstrances of the carpenter , who is the proper judge of the condition of a vessel , and who declared , with honesty and resolution , against their whole procedure .
But they pursued their new scheme without any regard to his murmurs or assertions  and when they arrived at Antigua , found some method of influencing the officers of that island to declare the ship unfit for the prosecution of the voyage .


Their design , sir , was now happily completed .
To confirm the determination which had been pronounced in their favour , they stranded the ship upon a bank of sand , forced out the iron that grapples the timber together , and having first taken away the masts and rigging , and whatever else could be used or sold , threw the ballast to each end , and so broke the vessel in the middle .


By this well-contrived shipwreck , having , as they imagined , raised their fortunes , they came home triumphantly from their prosperous voyage , and claimed the money for which the ship was insured .
The insurers , startled at a demand so unexpected , inquired into the affair with all the industry which its importance might naturally incite , and , after some consultation , determined to try whether the ship might not be refitted and brought to Britain .


In pursuance of this resolution , they sent workmen and materials , and , without much expense , or any difficulty , brought it hither .


I believe , sir , this relation is sufficient at once to prove the practice , and explain the nature of the frauds to which this method of insurance gives occasion  but as the frequency of them is such , that many instances may be produced , I shall offer another short narrative of the same kind .


A ship that belonged to the East India company , insured after this method , was run ashore by the captain , in such a manner that he imagined none but himself able to recover it , and therefore , though it cost five thousand pounds , sold it for five hundred  but the purchaser , no less expert than the captain , found means very speedily to disengage it , to restore it to a proper condition with little expense , and was much enriched by his fortunate bargain .


I can not but observe , sir , that this kind of fraud is more formidable , as it may be practised without a possibility of detection : had the captain , instead of stranding , destroyed his vessel , how could his wickedness ever have been discovered  or how could the South sea company 's ship have been brought home , had it been sunk in some distant corner of the world .


This practice , sir , and the frauds which it has occasioned , and the suspicions which the easy practice of frauds always creates , have produced so many trials , and filled the courts of justice with such intricate contentions , that the judges , who know , perhaps , nothing of this practice but from its effects , have often declared it to be so pregnant with contests and cheats , that it ought not to be suffered , and that a law for suppressing it would much contribute to the establishment of peace , and the security of property .


I am not insensible , sir , of the force of the argument made use of by the honourable gentleman who spoke in favour of this practice , and can not but allow it that regard which his reasonings always deserve  it is the strongest , and perhaps the only argument that can be produced .
His assertion of the impossibility of estimating the real value of a ship , or of foreknowing the success of a voyage , is incontestable : but perhaps it will follow from thence , not that an imaginary value ought to be admitted , but that no insurance ought to be allowed , where there is no rational method of ascertaining it  or , at least , that all such insurance ought to be rather below the probable value than above it .


If the grievance complained of has been proved not to be imaginary , we ought , doubtless , to consult how it may be remedied  nor do I believe that our consultations will be ineffectual , if we engage in them , not with an intention to perplex , but to inform each other .
I am of opinion , sir , that the importance of the question requires a committee  nor can I discover any essential defect in the bill , which should hinder it from passing into a law .


Mr. BURRELL spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I am convinced by experience , as well as reason , that so many inconveniencies arise from this method of insurance , that it affords so many opportunities of fraud , and gives such encouragement to negligence , that I shall willingly concur in any measures that may effectually suppress it .


It is , sir , too well known to require proof , that interest is the parent of diligence , and that men attend to the performance of their duty , in proportion as they must suffer by the neglect of it  and , therefore , every practice that deprives honesty of its reward is injurious to the publick .


But that this is the consequence of estimating ships at an imaginary value in the offices of insurance , is , to the highest degree , evident .
When a ship is estimated above its real value , how will the commander suffer by a wreck , or what shall restrain him from destroying his vessel , when it may be done with security to himself , except that integrity , which , indeed , ought to be generally diffused , but which is not always to be found , and to which few men think it safe to trust upon occasions of far less importance .


To show , sir , that I do not indulge groundless suspicions , or magnify the bare possibility of fraud into reality  that I do not blacken human nature , or propose laws against wickedness that has not yet existed  it may be proper to mention some letters , in which I have been informed , by my correspondent at Leghorn , of the state of the ships which have arrived there  ships so weakly manned , and so penuriously or negligently stored , so much decayed in the bottoms , and so ill fitted with rigging , that he declares his astonishment at their arrival .


It may deserve our consideration , sir , whether the success of the Spanish privateers may not be , in great part , attributed to this pernicious practice  whether captains , when their vessels are insured for more than their value , do not rashly venture into known danger ?
whether they do not wilfully miss the security of convoys ?
whether they do not direct their courses where privateers may most securely cruise ?
whether they do not surrender with less resistance than interest would excite ?
and whether they do not raise clamours against the government for their ill success , to avoid the suspicion of negligence or fraud ?


That other frauds are committed in the practice of insuring , is well known to the honourable gentleman : it is a common practice to take money upon bottomry , by way of pledge , for the captain 's fidelity , and to destroy this security by insuring above the real value  so that the captain may gain by neglecting the care of his vessel , or , at least , secure himself from loss , and indulge his ease or his pleasure without any interruption from the fear of diminishing his fortune .


The whole practice of insurance , sir , is , in its present state , I believe , so perplexed with frauds , and of such manifest tendency to the obstruction of commerce , that it absolutely requires some legal regulations .


Sir John BARNARD then spoke to this purpose : -- Of frauds in the practice of insurance , with regard to which the honourable gentleman has appealed to me , I can confidently affirm that I am totally ignorant : I know not of any fraudulent practices openly carried on , or established by custom , which I suppose are meant : for with regard to single acts of fraud , committed by particular men , it is not to be supposed but that they have been detected in this , as in all other branches of traffick : nor can I conceive that any argument can be drawn from them against the practice  for if every part of commerce is to be prohibited , which has furnished villains with opportunities of deceit , we shall contract trade into a narrow compass .


With regard , sir , to the instance of the Royal George , though the proceedings of the officers are not wholly to be vindicated , yet part of their conduct is less inexplicable than it has been represented .
Their return to Antigua , when they were bound for Britain , and were within a week 's sailing of their port , is easily to be defended , if the wind was contrary to their intended course  for it is not difficult to conceive that they might reach a distant port , with a favourable wind , much sooner than one much nearer , with the wind against them .


I have always observed , sir , that the gentlemen engaged in the trade to the East Indies , assume an air of superiority , to which I know not what claim they can produce , and seem to imagine , that their charter gives them more extensive knowledge , and more acute sagacity , than falls to the lot of men not combined in their association .


But however these gentlemen may disapprove my arguments , and however they may misrepresent them , I shall be satisfied , that they will have , with the disinterested and impartial , their just weight , and that this affair will not be hastily determined upon an imperfect examination .


Sir Robert WALPOLE replied to this effect : -- Whether the merchants are satisfied with the present methods of insuring , or what is the opinion of any separate body of men , I think it absolutely unnecessary to inquire .
We are constituted for the publick advantage , and are engaged by our senatorial character to consider , not the private interest of particular men , but the general advantage of our country .


In our pursuit , sir , of national interest , we shall be obliged frequently to oppose the schemes which private men or separate fraternities , have formed for their own advantage , and which they may be expected to defend with all their art  both because every man is unwilling to imagine that the publick interest and his own are opposite , and because it is to be feared , that many may consider the publick only in subordination to themselves , and be very little solicitous about the general prosperity of their country , provided none of the calamities which afflict it extend their influence to themselves .


We are in the discussion of this question , sir , to consider that we are engaged in a war against a nation from which insults , depredations , oppressions , and cruelties , have been long complained of , and against which we are , therefore , to act with a resolution proportioned to the injuries which we have suffered , and to our desire of vengeance .
We are to practice every method of distressing them , and to promote the success of our arms even at the expense of present gain , and the interest of private men .


It is well known , sir , to all who have either heard or read of the Spaniards , that they live in carelessness and indolence , neglect all the natural advantages of their own country , despise the gain of foreign commerce , and depend wholly on their American settlements , for all the conveniences , and , perhaps , for most of the necessaries of life .


This is the particular circumstance that makes a war with Britain so much to be dreaded by them .
A nation superiour to them by sea holds them besieged , like a garrison surrounded by an army , precludes them from supplies , intercepts their succours , and if it can not force their walls by attack , can , at least , by a blockade , starve them to a capitulation .


Thus , sir , by a naval war with an enemy of superiour strength , they must at length be subdued , and subdued , perhaps , without a battle , and without the possibility of resistance  against such an enemy their courage or their discipline is of no use  they may form armies , indeed , but which can only stand upon the shore , to defend what their enemies have no intention of invading , and see those ships seized in which their pay is treasured , or their provisions are stored .


Such , sir , is our natural superiority over the Spaniards , a species of superiority that must inevitably prevail , if it be not defeated by our own folly  and surely a more effectual method of defeating it , the Spaniards themselves could not have discovered , than that of insuring , their ships among our merchants .


When a ship thus insured is taken , which , notwithstanding all precautions , must sometimes happen , we examine the cargo , find it extremely valuable , and triumph in our success  we not only count the gain to ourselves , but the loss to our enemies , and determine that a small number of such captures will reduce them to offer us peace upon our own terms .


Such are the conclusions which are made , and made with reason , by men unacquainted with the secret practices of our merchants , and who do not suspect us to be stupid enough to secure our enemies against ourselves  but it is often found , upon a more close examination , that our ships of war have only plundered our merchants , and that our privateers may , indeed , have enriched themselves , but impoverished their country .
It is discovered that the loss of the Spaniards is to be repaid , and , perhaps , sometimes with interest , by the British insurers .


If it be urged , that we ought not to enact any laws which may obstruct the gain of our fellow-subjects , may it not be asked , why all trade with Spain is prohibited  may not the trade be equally gainful with the insurance , and may not the gain be more generally distributed , and , therefore , be more properly national ?


But this trade was prohibited , because it was more necessary to our enemies than to ourselves  it was prohibited , because the laws of war require , that a less evil should be suffered to inflict a greater  it is upon this principle that every battle is fought , and that we fire our own ships to consume the navies of the enemy .


For this reason , sir , it appears to me evident beyond contradiction , that the insurance of Spanish ships ought to be prohibited : we shall , indeed , lose the profit of the insurance , but we shall be reimbursed by the captures , which is an argument that can not be produced for the prohibition of commerce .


It is urged , sir , that they may insure their ships in other countries  an assertion , of which , whether it be true or not , I am not able to decide  but it is acknowledged , that the necessity of establishing new correspondence will be at least a temporary obstruction of their trade , and an obstruction of even a short continuance may lay them at our mercy .


But let us , sir , reflect upon the weakness of this argument , -- they must be allowed to insure here , because they may insure in other places  will it not be equally just to urge , that they must trade with us , because they may trade with other nations ?
And may it not be answered , that though we can not wholly suspend their commerce , it is yet our business to obstruct it as far as we are able ?


May it-not , sir , be farther affirmed , that by insuring in other nations , they may injure their allies by falling into our hands , but do not the less benefit us ?
that if they do not grow weaker , we at least are strengthened  but that by insuring among us , whatever steps are taken , the equilibrium of the war is preserved always the same ?


It is asserted , and I suppose with truth , that we insure at a lower rate than others , and it will , therefore , follow , that the Spaniards , whenever their ships shall escape us , will suffer more by having-insured amongst foreigners , than if they had contracted with our merchants .


Thus it appears , sir , that there are stronger reasons for prohibiting the insurance of Spanish ships , than for putting a stop to our commerce with them  and that whether their ships are taken by us , or escape us , it is the general interest of the nation , that they shall be insured by foreign merchants .


With respect , sir , to the East India company , I have no regard to their interest , considered as distinct from that of the rest of the nation  nor have received any solicitations from them to promote this bill , or to espouse their interest  but can not , without concealing my real sentiments , deny , that as they have the grant of an exclusive trade to the East Indies , to insure the ships that are sent thither without their permission , is to invade their rights , and to infringe their charter  and that the practice , if the validity of their charter be admitted , is illegal , and ought to be discountenanced .


The practice , sir , of insuring , interest or no interest , or of assigning to ships an imaginary value , is nothing more than a particular game , a mere solemn species of hazard , and ought , therefore , to be prohibited , for every reason that can be urged against games of chance .


With regard to this bill in general , it is , in my opinion , highly necessary , nor can I discover any important objection that can be made against it .
Some law of this kind , and to this purpose , I have long intended to offer to the consideration of this assembly , and since it is now before us , I think we ought to consider it with the attention which may be justly expected from us .


Lord BALTIMORE spoke thus : -- Sir , I know not how properly the practice of insuring may be termed a species of hazard , nor do I think any thing more is to be considered , than whether the game be gainful to the nation , or not , for I can not discover that there is any absurdity in enriching ourselves at the expense of other nations , whether enemies or allies .
That we ought to prefer the general good to the advantage of individuals , is undoubted , but I can not conceive that in this case there can be any opposition between private and publick interest .
If our insurers gain by securing the ships of our enemies , the nation is benefited , for all national gain must circulate through the hands of individuals .


No man will assert that we ought to assist our enemies , nor will any man imagine that we assist them by impoverishing them , and if our insurers gain by their practice , the Spaniards must undoubtedly be losers .


Mr. WILLIMOT spoke next , to the following purpose : -- Sir , I have conversed on the question to which this bill relates , with men engaged in various kinds of traffick , and who have no common interest but that of their country .
I have dispersed among the merchants , most eminent for their acquaintance with the whole extent of commerce , and for their knowledge of the true interest of the nation , copies of this bill , and can not find any of them so sensible of the grievance of which we have so loud complaints , as to desire that it should be redressed by the measures now proposed .


That frauds are practised on every side , in this , as well as in other trades , the general corruption of our age gives us sufficient reason to suspect  but what is common to every sort of traffick , can not be produced as an argument for the prohibition of any .


That the practice of insuring an imaginary value may give opportunity for greater frauds than can be practised in common dealings , is likewise evident , but I can not discover such frauds to require the interposition of the legislature .


If they are practised only by those of our own nation , the publick does not suffer  for property is only transferred from one subject to another : the fraud ought , indeed , to be severely punished in the courts of criminal justice , but the custom which gave the opportunity of practising it , ought not to be restrained , any more than any other profession not criminal in itself , but liable to accidental abuses .


If our insurers are defrauded by foreigners , the nation is then , indeed , more nearly affected , but even in that case , it is to be remembered , that the private interest of the insurers , who must be immediately ruined , is a sufficient security for the publick .
For it can not , sir , be conceived that any man will obstinately carry on a business , by which he becomes every day poorer , or , that when he desists he will be succeeded by another , who can not but know that he engages in that traffick to his certain ruin .


The true state of this affair is , that frauds are , indeed , often committed , and are for that reason always suspected , and that the insurers , when they insure the ship and cargo against accidents , reckon , among other chances , the probability of being cheated , and proportion their demands , not only to the length and danger of the voyage , but to the character , likewise , of the man with whom they contract .


This , sir , is always the practice of those whom experience has made acquainted with the danger of implicit confidence and unsuspecting credulity , nor do any but the young and unskilful suffer themselves to be so exposed to frauds , as that their fortunes should be injured , or the general gain of their business overbalanced , by a few deceits .


Thus it appears , that notwithstanding the ease and safety with which the present methods of insurance admit fraud to be practised , the insurers , by a proportionate degree of caution , secure themselves from being injured , and , by consequence , the nation .


The insurance of foreign ships is now to be considered , by which great profit arises to the nation .
We insure , sir , as it has been observed , at lower rates than other nations , because we have more business of this kind , and the smallness of our profit is compensated by the frequency  the cheapness of insurances , and eagerness of foreigners to insure here , reciprocally contribute to each other  we are often applied to , because we insure at an easy rate , and we can insure at an easy rate , because we are often applied to .


Nor is the cheapness of British insurance the only motive to the preference which it preserves among foreigners , who are induced to apply to this nation , by the reputation which our merchants have deservedly gained for probity and punctuality superiour to that of any other traders .
Our merchants , sir , bargain without artifice , pay without subterfuges , and are ready on all occasions to preserve their character at the hazard of their profit .


From these two considerations we may draw unanswerable arguments against any restraints upon the practice of insuring : if foreigners are once disappointed in their applications to us , our business will in a great part cease , and as we shall not then be able to insure at lower rates than other nations , we shall never recover that branch of our trade .
And as the character of the British merchants exempts them from any suspicion of practices pernicious to the publick , why should they be restrained ?
Why , sir , should they appear to be suspected by the legislature of their own country , whom foreigners trust without hesitation .


It has been objected to them with great warmth , and urged with much rhetorical exaggeration , that they assist the enemies of their country , that they prolong the war , and defeat those advantages which our situation and commerce have given us  imputations sufficiently atrocious , if they were founded upon truth .


But let us , sir , examine the arguments by which this accusation has been supported , and inquire whether this triumph of eloquence has been occasioned by any real superiority of evidence or reason  it is urged , that we have already prohibited commerce with the Spaniards , and that , therefore , we ought , likewise , to prohibit the insurance of their ships .


It will not require , sir , an imagination very fertile , or a knowledge very extensive , to supply arguments sufficient to refute the supposed demonstration  in opposition to which it may be urged , that this kind of commerce is of a peculiar nature , that it subsists upon opinion , and is preserved by the reputation of our insurers  a reputation that the insurers of other nations may obtain by the same means , and from whom we shall , therefore , never recover it .


It may be observed , sir , that other commodities are the peculiar product of different countries , and that there is no danger of losing our other trade by suspending it , because it depends upon the excellence of our manufactures  but that insurance may be the commodity of any country , where money and common honesty are to be found .


This argument may , perhaps , be yet more effectually invalidated , or , perhaps , entirely subverted , by denying the expedience of that prohibition which is produced as a precedent for another restraint .
Nor , indeed , does it appear why we should preclude ourselves from a gainful trade , because the money is drawn by it out of the hands of our enemies  or why the product of our lands should lie unconsumed , or our manufactures stand unemployed , rather than we should sell to our enemies what they will purchase at another place , or by the intervention of a neutral power .


To sell to an enemy that which may enable him to injure us , that which he must necessarily obtain , and which he could buy from no other , would , indeed , be to the last degree , absurd  but that may surely be sold them without any breach of morality or policy , which they can want with less inconvenience than we can keep .
If we were besieging a town , I should not advise our soldiers to sell to the inhabitants ammunition or provisions , but can not discover the folly of admitting them to purchase ornaments for their houses , or brocades for their ladies .


But , without examining with the utmost accuracy , whether the late prohibition was rational or not , I have , I hope , suggested objections sufficient to make the question doubtful , and to incline us to try the success of one experiment , before we venture upon another more hazardous .


I am never willing , sir , to load trade with restraints  trade is , in its own nature , so fugitive and variable , that no constant course can be prescribed to it  and those regulations which were proper when they were made , may , in a few months , become difficulties and obstructions .
We well know , that many of the measures which our ancestors pursued for the encouragement of commerce , have been found of pernicious consequence  and even in this age , which , perhaps , experience , more than wisdom , has enlightened , I have known few attempts of that kind which have not defeated the end for which they were made .


It is more prudent to leave the merchants at liberty to pursue those measures which experience shall dictate upon every occasion , and suffer them to snatch the present opportunity of honest gain , whenever it shall happen  they will never injure their own interest by the use of this liberty , and by preserving themselves , they will preserve the nation from detriment  nor will they need to be restrained by a law proposed without their solicitation , and of which they can not discover any beneficial consequences .


Mr. Horace WALPOLE spoke next , to this purpose : -- Sir , for the bill now before us I have no particular fondness , nor desire that it should be promoted by any other means than rational arguments , and the representation of indubitable facts .


I have no regard , sir , in this inquiry , to any private interest , or any other desire than that of securing the interest of my country , which , in my opinion , evidently requires that we should give no assistance to our enemies , that our merchants should cooperate with our navies , and that we should endeavour to withhold every thing that may make the war less burdensome to them , and , consequently , of longer continuance .


It was observed , sir , in the beginning of the debate , by a gentleman eminently skilled in mercantile affairs , that insurance was practised by many nations  but he did not inform us of what one of the clauses makes it proper to inquire , whether they allowed the method of insuring interest or no interest , and rating ships at an imaginary value .
This is , I know , prohibited by the Dutch , a nation whose authority on commercial questions will not be disputed , nor do they allow their East Indian ships to be insured at all .


The difficulty of estimating the value of any cargo has been urged in defence of this practice , nor is the defence wholly without weight , because the cargo in many voyages can not be ascertained .
I shall , however , take this opportunity of observing , though I may somewhat digress from the present argument , how necessary it is that some of our exported cargoes should be exactly specified .


I have been lately informed , sir , that six ships laden with British wool , have entered at one time into a port of France  nor do I know how this practice , which is justly complained of as pernicious to our trade , and threatening the ruin of our country , can be prevented but by a constant and regular particularization of every cargo carried to France .


I admit , sir , that some cargoes which are imported can not be particularly registered  such is the gold with which we are daily supplied by our commerce with the Portuguese , in opposition to their laws , and which our merchants are , therefore , under the necessity of concealing .


It is not , indeed , easy to foresee all the inconveniencies that may arise from new regulations of commerce  but the difficulty is not so great as has been represented , nor can I conceive why all our consultations on trade should be without effect .
Gentlemen may obtain some knowledge of commerce from their own observation , which they may enlarge by an unconfined and indifferent conversation with traders of various classes , and by inquiries into the different branches of commerce  inquiries , sir , which are generally neglected by those whose employments confine their attention to particular parts of commerce , or whose application to business hinders them from attending to any opinions but those which their own personal experience enables them to form .


From these informations impartially collected , and diligently compared , a man not engaged in the profession of a merchant may form general principles , and draw consequences , more certain , and more extensive in their relations , than those which are struck out only from the observation of one subdivided species of commerce .


A member of this house , sir , thus enlightened by inquiry , and whose judgment is not diverted from its natural rectitude by the impulse of any private consideration , may judge of any commercial debate with less danger of errour or partiality than the merchants , of whom , nevertheless , I have the highest esteem , and whose knowledge , or probity , I do not intend to depreciate , when I declare my fears that they may sometimes confound general maxims of trade with the opinions of particular branches , and sometimes mistake their own gain for the interest of the publick .


The interest of the merchants ought , indeed , always to be considered in this house  but then it ought to be regarded only in subordination to that of the whole community , a subordination which the gentleman who spoke last seems to have forgotten .
He may , perhaps , not intend long to retain his senatorial character , and , therefore , delivered his opinion only as a merchant .


He has distinguished between the conduct of experienced and unskilful insurers , with how much justice I shall not determine .
I am afraid that a vigorous inquiry would discover , that neither age nor youth has been able to resist strong temptations to some practices , which neither law nor justice can support , and that those , whose experience has made them cautious , have not been always equally honest .


But this is a subject upon which I am not inclined to dwell , and only mention as the reason which convinces me of the propriety of the bill before us .


Sir William YONGE spoke to this effect : -- Sir , there appears no probability that the different opinions which have been formed of this bill will be reconciled by this debate  nor , indeed , is there any reason for wondering at this contrariety of sentiments .


The several clauses of the bill have relations and consequences so different , that scarce any one man can approve them all  and in our present deliberation , an objection to a particular clause is considered as an argument against the whole bill .


It is , therefore , necessary , to prevent an unprofitable expense of time , to resolve the house into a committee , in which the bill may be considered by single clauses , and that part which can not be defended may be rejected , and that only retained which deserves our approbation .
In the committee , when we have considered the first clause , and heard the objections against it , we may mend it  or , if it can not be amended , reject or postpone it , and so proceed through the whole bill with much greater expedition , and at the same time , with a more diligent view of every clause , than while we are obliged to take the whole at once into our consideration .


I shall , for my part , approve some clauses , and make objections to others  but think it proper to reserve my objections , and the reasons of my approbation , for the committee into which we ought to go on this occasion .


[ The bill was referred to a committee , but not forty members staying in the house , it was dropped . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 2 , 1740-1 .


DEBATE ON THE BILL FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND INCREASE OF SEAMEN .


The bill was ordered to be read the second time , and to be printed for the use of the members , that it might be thoroughly examined and understood .


On the forty-fourth day , the second reading of the bill was postponed to the fiftieth  but the grand motion being debated on that day , nothing else was heard .


On the fifty-first it was again put off  but


On the fifty-sixth day , being read a second time , it was , after some opposition , referred to a committee of the whole house , to sit five days after .
In the meanwhile ,


On the fifty-seventh , it was ordered that the proper officers do lay before this house an account of what persons were authorized , by virtue of the act in the 4th of queen Anne , for `` the encouragement and increase of seamen , and for the better and speedier manning her fleet  '' to conduct seamen or seafaring men taken upon privy searches made by applications to justices  and what number of seamen or seafaring men were returned  also , the charge attending the same .


On the sixty-first day , moved that the said account should be read  which being done , the house resolved itself into a grand committee on the present bill  and the first clause being read , proposing the blanks to be filled thus : that every volunteer seamen , after five years ' service , be entitled to six pounds per year , during life .


Sir John BARNARD rose , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , as it is our duty to provide laws , by which all frauds and oppressions may be punished , when they are detected , we are no less obliged to obviate such practices as shall make punishments necessary  nor are we only to facilitate the detection , but take away , as far as it is possible , the opportunities of guilt .
It is to no purpose that punishments are threatened , if they can be evaded , or that rewards are offered , if they may by any mean artifices be withheld .


For this reason , sir , I think it necessary to observe , that the intent of this clause , the most favourable and alluring clause in the bill , may lose its effect by a practice not uncommon , by which any man , however inclined to serve his country , may be defrauded of the right of a volunteer .


Many men have voluntarily applied to the officers of ships of war , and after having been rejected by them as unfit for the service , have been dragged on board within a few days , perhaps within a few hours afterwards , to undergo all the hardships , without the merit , of volunteers .


When any man , sir , has been rejected by the sea officers , he ought to have a certificate given him , which shall be an exemption from an impress , that if any other commander shall judge more favourably of his qualifications , he may always have the privilege of a volunteer , and be entitled to the reward which he deserved , by his readiness to enter the service .


If such provisions are not made , this hateful practice , a practice , sir , common and notorious , and very discouraging to such as would enter the service of the publick , may so far prevail , that no man shall be able to denominate himself a volunteer , or claim the reward proposed by the bill .


Admiral WAGER spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , it is not common for men to receive injuries without applying for redress , when it may certainly be obtained .
If any proceedings like those which are now complained of , had been mentioned at the board of admiralty , they had been immediately censured and redressed  but as no such accusations were offered , I think it may probably be concluded , that no such crimes have been committed .


For what purpose oppressions of this kind should be practised , it is not easy to conceive  for the officers are not at all rewarded for impressing sailors .
As , therefore , it is not probable that any man acts wickedly or cruelly without temptation : as I have never heard any such injury complained of by those that suffered it , I can not but imagine , that it is one of those reports which arise from mistake , or are forged by malice , to injure the officers , and obstruct the service .


Lord BALTIMORE rose next , and spoke to the following effect : -- That the practice now complained of , sir , is very frequent , and , whatever may be the temptation to it , such as every day produces some instances of , I have reasons for asserting with great confidence .
I have , within these few days , as I was accidentally upon the river , informed myself of two watermen ignominiously dragged by force into the service to which they had voluntarily offered themselves a few days before .
The reasons of such oppression , it is the business of those gentlemen to inquire , whom his majesty intrusts with the care of his fleet  but to interrupt the course of wickedness , to hinder it from frustrating the rewards offered by the publick , is the province of the representatives of the people .
And I hope , sir , some proviso will be made in this case .


Admiral NORRIS rose and said : -- Sir , if any such practices had been frequent , to what can it be imputed , that those who employ their lives in maritime business should be strangers to them ?
Why have no complaints been made by those that have been injured ?
Or why should officers expose themselves to the hazard of censure without advantage ?
I can not discover why these hardships should be inflicted , nor how they could have been concealed , and , therefore , think the officers of the navy may be cleared from the imputation , without farther inquiry .


Sir John BARNARD spoke again , to the following purpose : -- Sir , it is in vain that objections are made , if the facts upon which they are founded may be denied at pleasure : nothing is more easy than to deny , because proofs are not required of a negative .
But as negatives require no proof , so they have no authority , nor can any consequence be deduced from them .
I might , therefore , suffer the facts to remain in their present state , asserted on one side by those that have reasons to believe them , and doubted on the other without reasons  for surely he can not be said to reason , who questions an assertion only because he does not know it to be true .


But as every question , by which the liberty of a Briton may be affected , is of importance sufficient to require that no evidence should be suppressed by which it may be cleared , I can not but think it proper that a committee should be formed to examine the conduct of the officers in this particular  and in confidence of the veracity of those from whom I received my information , I here promise to produce such evidence as shall put an end to controversy and doubt .


If this is not granted , sir , the fact must stand recorded and allowed  for to doubt , and refuse evidence , is a degree of prejudice and obstinacy without example .
Nor is this the only objection to the clause before us , which appears very imperfect , with regard to the qualifications specified as a title to the reward .
The reward ought not to be confined to those who shall hereafter be invited by the promise of it to engage in the service , while those who entered into it without any such prospect , are condemned to dangers and fatigues without a recompense .
Where merit is equal , the reward ought to be equal  and , surely , where there is greater merit , the reward proposed by the senate , as an encouragement to bravery , ought not to be less .
To be excluded from the advantages which others have obtained , only by avoiding the service , can not but depress the spirit of those whose zeal and courage incited them , at the beginning of the war , to enter into the fleet  and to deject those from whom we expect defence and honour , is neither prudent nor just .


Nor is it , in my opinion , proper to offer the same reward indiscriminately to all that shall accept it  rewards ought to be proportioned to desert , and no man can justly be paid for what he can not perform  there ought , therefore , to be some distinction made between a seaman by profession , one that has learned his art at the expense of long experience , labour , and hazard , and a man who only enters the ship because he is useless on land , and who can only incommode the sailors till he has been instructed by them .


It appears , sir , to me , a considerable defect in our naval regulations , that wages are not proportioned to ability  and I think it may not be now unseasonably proposed , that sailors should be paid according to the skill which they have acquired  a provision by which an emulation would be raised among them , and that industry excited , which now languishes for want of encouragement , and those capacities awakened which now slumber in ignorance and sloth , from the despair of obtaining any advantage by superiority of knowledge .


Sir Robert WALPOLE then rose , and spoke as follows : -- That this charge , sir , however positively urged , is generally unjust , the declarations of these honourable gentlemen are sufficient to evince , since it is not probable that the injured persons would not have found some friend to have represented these hardships to the admiralty , and no such representations could have been made without their knowledge .


Yet , sir , I am far from doubting that by accident , or , perhaps , by malice , some men have been treated in this manner  for it is not in the power of any administration to make all those honest or wise whom they are obliged to employ  and when great affairs are depending , minute circumstances can not always be attended to .
If the vigilance of those who are intrusted with the chief direction of great numbers of subordinate officers be such , that corrupt practices are not frequent , and their justice such , that they are never unpunished when legally detected , the most strict inquirer can expect no more .
Power will sometimes be abused , and punishment sometimes be escaped .


It is , sir , easy to be conceived that a report may become general , though the practice be very rare .
The fact is multiplied as often as it is related , and every man who hears the same story twice , imagines that it is told of different persons , and exclaims against the tyranny of the officers of the navy .


But these , in my opinion , sir , are questions , if not remote from the present affair , yet by no means essential to it .
The question now before us is , not what illegalities have been committed in the execution of impresses , but how impresses themselves may become less necessary ?
how the nation may be secured without injury to individuals ?
and how the fleet may be manned with less detriment to commerce ?


Sir , the reward now proposed is intended to excite men to enter the service without compulsion  and if this expedient be not approved , another ought to be suggested : for I hope gentlemen are united in their endeavours to find out some method of security to the publick , and do not obstruct the proceedings of the committee , that when the fleets lie inactive and useless , they may have an opportunity to reproach the ministry .


Admiral NORRIS spoke next , in substance : -- Sir , though it is not necessary to enter into an accurate examination of the gentleman 's proposal , yet I can not but observe , that by making it , he discovers himself unacquainted with the disposition of seamen , among whom nothing raises so much discontent as the suspicion of partiality .
Should one man , in the same rank , receive larger wages than another , he who thought himself injured , as he who is paid less will always think , would be so far from exerting his abilities to attain an equality with his associate , that he would probably never be prevailed on to lay his hand upon the tackling , but would sit sullen , or work perversely , though the ship were labouring in a storm , or sinking in a battle .


Mr. GORE then spoke as follows : -- Sir , the danger of introducing distinctions among men in the same rank , where every man that imagines his merit neglected , may have an opportunity of resenting the injury , is , doubtless , such as no prudent commander will venture to incur .


Every man , in this case , becomes the judge of his own merit  and as he will always discover some reason for the preference of another very different from superiority of desert , he will , by consequence , be either enraged or dispirited , will either resolve to desert his commander , or betray him to the enemies , or not oppose them .


I remember , sir , though imperfectly , a story which I heard in my travels , of an army in which some troops received a penny a day less than the rest  a parsimony which cost dear in the day of battle  for the disgusted troops laid down their arms before the enemy , and suffered their general to be cut in pieces .


General WADE then spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I can not but concur with the honourable gentleman in his opinion , that those who are already engaged in the service , who have borne the fatigues of a long voyage , and perhaps are , at this hour , exposing their lives in battle to defend the rights of their country , ought to have the same claim to the reward proposed , with those who shall hereafter offer themselves .
Nor , in my opinion , ought those who have hitherto been pressed into our fleets to be discouraged from their duty by an exclusion from the same advantage .
For if they were compelled to serve in the fleet , they were compelled when there was not this encouragement for volunteers , which , perhaps , they would have accepted if it had been then proposed , Every man , at least , will allege , that he would have accepted it , and complain he suffers only by the fault of the government  a government which he will not be very zealous to defend , while he is considered with less regard than others , from whom no greater services are expected .


A prospect of new rewards , sir , will add new alacrity to all the forces , and an equal distribution of favour will secure an unshaken and inviolable fidelity .
Nothing but union can produce success , and nothing can secure union but impartiality and justice .


Mr. SANDYS rose , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , the efficacy of rewards , and the necessity of an impartial distribution , are no unfruitful subjects for rhetorick  but it may , perhaps , be more useful at present to consider , with such a degree of attention as the question must be acknowledged to deserve , to whom these rewards are to be paid , and from what fund they are expected to arise .


With regard to those who are to claim the reward , sir , they seem very negligently specified  for they are distinguished only by the character of having served five years  a distinction unintelligible , without explanation .


It is , I suppose , sir , the intent of the bill , that no man shall miss the reward but by his own fault  and , therefore , it may be inquired , what is to be the fate of him who shall be disabled in his first adventure , whom in the first year , or month , of his service , an unlucky shot shall confine for the remaining part of his life to inactivity : as the bill is now formed , he must be miserable without a recompense  and his wounds , which make him unable to support himself , will , though received in defence of his country , entitle him to no support from the publick .


Nor is this the only difficulty that may arise from the specifying of so long a service  for how can any man that shall enter on board the fleet be informed that the war will continue for five years ?
May we not all justly hope , that alacrity , unanimity , and prudence , may , in a much shorter time , reduce our enemies to beg for peace ?
And shall our sailors lose the reward of their hazards and their labours , only because they have been successful ?
What will this be less than making their bravery a crime or folly , and punishing them for not protracting the war by cowardice or treachery ?


But let us suppose , sir , those defects supplied by a more explicit and determinate specification  there will yet arise an objection far more formidable  an objection , which the present state of our revenues will not suffer to be answered .
The consideration of the greatness of the annual payment which this proposal requires , ought to incite every man to employ all his sagacity in search of some other method , equally efficacious , and less expensive .


We have already , sir , forty thousand seamen in our pay , to whom eight thousand more are speedily to be added : when each of these shall demand his stipend , a new burden of two hundred and eighty-eight thousand pounds must be laid upon the nation  upon a nation , whose lands are mortgaged , whose revenues are anticipated , and whose taxes can not be borne without murmurs , nor increased without sedition .


The nation has found , by experience , that taxes once imposed for just reasons , and continued upon plausible pretences , till they are become familiar , are afterwards continued upon motives less laudable , are too productive of influence , and too instrumental towards facilitating the measures of the ministry , to be ever willingly remitted .


Mr. BLADEN spoke next , as follows : -- Sir , it is obvious , that when the balance is unequal , it may be reduced to an equilibrium , as well by taking weight out of one scale , as adding it to the other .
The wages offered by the merchants overbalance , at present , those which are proposed by the crown  to raise the allowance in the ships of war , will be , to lay new loads upon the publick , and will incommode the merchants , whose wages must always bear the same proportion to the king 's .
The only method , then , that remains , is to lighten the opposite scale , by restraining the merchants from giving wages , in time of war , beyond a certain value  for , as the service of the crown is then more immediately necessarv to the general advantage than that of the merchants , it ought to be made more gainful .
Sailors , sir , are not , generally , men of very extensive views  and , therefore , we can not expect that they should prefer the general good of their country before their own present interest  a motive of such power , that even in men of curious researches , refined sentiments , and generous education , we see , too often , that it surmounts every other consideration .


Lord BALTIMORE then spoke again : -- Sir , to the expedient which the honourable gentleman who spoke last has suggested , and which he must be confessed to have placed in the strongest light , many objections may be raised , which I am afraid will not easily be removed .


The first , sir , which occurs to me on this short reflection is not less than the impossibility of putting his scheme in execution .
The prescription of wages which he proposes , may be eluded by a thousand artifices , by advanced money , by gratuitous acknowledgments , the payment of money for pretended services , or by secret contracts , which it would be the interest of both parties to conceal .


But if this objection could be surmounted by severity and vigilance , would not this expedient help to defeat the general intention of the bill ?
A bill not designed as an immediate resource , a mere temporary project to supply our fleets for the present year , but as a method for removing the only obstruction of the British power , the difficulty of manning our ships of war .


It is , I hope , sir , the intention of every man who has offered his sentiments on this occasion , to contrive some general encouragement for seamen , which shall not only invite them to assist their country at the first summons , but shall allure others to qualify themselves for the publick service , by engaging in the same profession .


This is only to be done by making the condition of sailors less miserable , by entitling them to privileges , and honouring them with distinctions .
But by limiting the merchant 's wages , if such limitations are , indeed , possible , though we may palliate the present distress , we shall diminish the number of sailors , and thereby not only contract our commerce but endanger our country .


Mr. TRACEY spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , I know not for what reasons the present method of advancing rewards at entrance is practised , of which , however specious it might appear , the success by no means encourages the continuance .
The sailors , though not a generation of men much disposed to reflection , or qualified for ratiocination , are not yet so void of thought as not easily to perceive that a small increase of constant wages is of more value than several pounds to be paid only at once , and which are squandered as soon as they are received .


Instead , therefore , of restraining the wages of the merchants , it seems probable , that by raising those of the king , we may man the fleet with most expedition  and one method of raising the wages will be to suppress the advanced money .


The ATTORNEY-GENERAL spoke next : -- Sir , if the sum of money now paid by way of advance can be supposed to have any effect , if it can be imagined that any number of seamen , however inconsiderable , are allured by it into the fleet , it is more usefully employed than it can be supposed to be when sunk into the current wages , and divided into small payments .


The advance money is only paid to those that enter : if no volunteers present themselves , no money is paid , and the nation doth not suffer by the offer : but if the wages are raised , the expense will be certain , without the certainty of advantage  for those that enter voluntarily into the fleet , will receive no more than those that are forced into it by an impress  and therefore there will be no incitement to enter without compulsion .
Thus every other inconvenience will remain , with the addition of a new burden to the nation  our forces will be maintained at a greater expense , and not raised with less difficulty .


Lord BALTIMORE said : -- Sir , I can not but concur in opinion with the honourable gentleman who spoke last , from my own acquaintance with the sentiments and habits that unalterably prevail among those who have been accustomed to the sea , a race of men to the last degree negligent of any future events , and careless about any provision against distant evils  men who have no thoughts at sea , but how to reach the land  nor at land , but how to squander what they have gained at sea .
To men like these , it may easily be imagined that no encouragement is equal to the temptation of present gain , and the opportunity of present pleasure .


Of this any man , sir , may convince himself , who shall talk to a crew but half an hour  for he shall find few among them , who will not , for a small sum of present money , sell any distant prospect of affluence or happiness .


Whether I am mistaken in my opinion , the honourable members who have long commanded in the naval service can easily determine , and I doubt not but they will agree that no motive can be proposed to a sailor equivalent to immediate reward .


Sir William YONGE spoke next : -- Sir , that some distinction ought to be made to the advantage of volunteers , if we intend to man our fleet without compulsion , is obvious and incontestable  and to avoid the necessity of compulsion ought to be the chief end of this bill  for nothing can be less to the advantage of the nation , than to continue the use of such ungrateful methods , and yet increase the publick expense .


We ought , therefore , in my opinion , to determine upon some peculiar reward , either to be advanced upon their entrance into the service , or paid at their dismission from it .


But as I see , sir , no reason for hoping that all the encouragement which can be offered , will raise volunteers in a sufficient number to secure our navigation , and assert our sovereignty , it seems not proper to confine our consultations to this part of the bill  for since compulsion is on many occasions apparently necessary , some method requires to be considered , in which it may be legal .


What new power ought to be placed in the magistrate , for what time , and with what restrictions , I am far from assuming the province of determining  but that some measures must be taken for compelling those who can not be persuaded , and discovering those that will not offer themselves , can not admit of doubt  and as the magistrate is at present without any authority for this purpose , it is evident that his power must be extended , for the same reason as it was given in its present degree -- the general benefit of the whole community .


Sir John BARNARD then spoke to the following effect : -- Sir , if the intent of this bill be to enable one part of the nation to enslave the other  if the plausible and inviting professions of encouraging and increasing seamen , are to terminate in violence , constraint , and oppression  it is unnecessary to dwell longer upon particular clauses .
The intention of the bill is detestable , and deserves not the ceremony of debate , or the forms of common regard .


If a man , sir , is liable to be forced from the care of his own private affairs , from his favourite schemes of life , from the engagements of domestick tenderness , or the prospects of near advantage , and subjected , without his consent , to the command of one whom he hates , or dreads , or perhaps despises , it requires no long argument to show , that by whatever authority he is thus treated , he is reduced to the condition of a slave , to that abject , to that hateful state , which every Englishman has been taught to avoid at the hazard of his life .


It is therefore evident , that a law which tends to confer such a power , subverts our constitution as far as its effects extend  a constitution , which was originally formed as a barrier against slavery , and which one age after another has endeavoured to strengthen .


Such a power , therefore , in whatever hands it may be lodged , I shall always oppose .
It is dangerous , sir , to intrust any man with absolute dominion , which is seldom known to be impartially exercised , and which often makes those corrupt , and insolent , whom it finds benevolent and honest .


The bill proposes only encouragement , and encouragement may be given by his majesty , without a new law  let us , therefore , draw up an address , and cease to debate , where there is no prospect of agreement .


Mr. WINNINGTON spoke as follows : -- Sir , the payment of an annual salary will , in my opinion , be to the last degree inconvenient and dangerous .
The yearly expense has been already estimated , and arises to a sum very formidable in our present state .
Nor is the necessity of adding to the publick burden , a burden which already is hard to be borne , the only objection to this proposal .


Nothing can more contribute to dispirit the nation , than to protract the consequences of a war , and to make the calamity felt , when the pleasures of victory and triumph have been forgotten  we shall be inclined rather to bear oppression and insult than endeavour after redress , if we subject ourselves and our posterity to endless exactions .


The expenses of the present provision for superannuated and disabled sailors , is no inconsiderable tax upon the publick , which is not less burdened by it for the manner of collecting it by a deduction from the sailors ' wages  for , whoever pays it immediately , it is the ultimate gift of the nation , and the utmost that can be allowed for this purpose .


It must be confessed , sir , the persons entitled to the pension are not sufficiently distinguished in the bill  by which , as it now stands , any of the worthless superfluities of a ship , even the servants of the captains , may , after five years , put in their demand , and plunder that nation which they never served .


Nor do I think , sir , the efficacy of this method will bear any proportion to the expense of it  for I am of opinion , that few of the sailors will be much affected by the prospect of a future pension .
I am , therefore , for dazzling them with five pounds , to be given them at their entrance , which will be but a single payment , and probably fill our fleets with greater expedition , than methods which appear more refined , and the effects of deeper meditation .


Lord GAGE spoke in the following manner : -- Sir , nothing is more clear than that a yearly pension will burden the nation , without any advantage  and as it will give occasion to innumerable frauds , it is a method which ought to be rejected .


As to the new power , sir , which is proposed to be placed in the hands of the magistrates , it undoubtedly reduces every sailor to a state of slavery , and is inconsistent with that natural right to liberty , which is confirmed and secured by our constitution .
The bill , therefore , is , in my opinion , defective in all its parts , of a tendency generally pernicious , and can not be amended but by rejecting it .


Mr. Henry PELHAM spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , I can not but think it necessary , that on this occasion , at least , gentlemen should remit the ardour of disputation , and lay the arts of rhetorick aside  that they should reserve their wit and their satire for questions of less importance , and unite , for once , their endeavours , that this affair may meet with no obstructions but from its natural difficulty .


We are now , sir , engaged in a war with a nation , if not of the first rank in power , yet by no means contemptible in itself  and , by its alliances , extremely formidable .
We are exposed , by the course of our trade , and the situation of our enemies , to many inevitable losses , and have no means of preventing our merchants from being seized , without any danger or expense to the Spaniards , but by covering the sea with our squadrons .


Nor are we , sir , to satisfy ourselves with barely defeating the designs of the Spaniards  our honour demands that we should force them to peace upon advantageous terms  that we should not repulse , but attack them  not only preserve our own trade and possessions , but endanger theirs .


It is by no means certain , sir , that in the prosecution of these designs we shall not be interrupted by the interest or jealousy of a nation far more powerful , whose forces we ought , therefore , to be able to resist .


A vigorous exertion of our strength will probably either intimidate any other power that may be inclined to attack us , or enable us to repel the injuries that shall be offered : discord and delay can only confirm our open enemies in their obstinacy , and animate those that have hitherto concealed their malignity to declare against us .


It is , therefore , sir , in no degree prudent to aggravate the inconveniencies of the measures proposed for accomplishing what every man seems equally to desire  to declaim against the expedients offered in the bill as pernicious , unjust , and oppressive , contributes very little to the production of better means .
That our affairs will not admit of long suspense , and that the present methods of raising seamen are not effectual , is universally allowed  it , therefore , evidently follows , sir , that some other must be speedily struck out .


I think it necessary to propose , that the house be resolved into a committee to-morrow morning  and hope all that shall assemble on this occasion , will bring with them no other passion than zeal for their country .


[ The speaker having taken the chair , the chairman of the committee reported , that they had made some progress  and desiring leave to sit again , it was resolved to go into the committee again on the morrow . ]


MARCH 4 , 1740-1 .


On the sixty-second day the affair was put off  but on the sixty-third , the house resolving itself into a committee , a clause was offered , by which five pounds were proposed to be advanced to an able seaman , and three pounds to every other man that should enter voluntarily into his majesty 's service , after twenty days , and within sixty .


After which , Mr. WINNINGTON spoke as follows : -- Sir , this is a clause in which no opposition can be apprehended , as those gentlemen who declared their disapprobation of the former , were almost unanimous in proposing this expedient , as the least expensive , and the most likely to succeed .


The time for the reception of volunteers upon this condition , is , sir , in my opinion , judiciously determined .
If it was extended to a greater length , or left uncertain , the reward would lose its efficacy , the sailors would neglect that which they might accept at any time , and would only have recourse to the ships of war when they could find no other employment .


Yet I can not conceal my apprehensions , that this bounty will not alone be sufficient to man our fleets with proper expedition  and that as allurements may be useful on one hand , force will be found necessary on the other  that the sailors may not only be incited to engage in the service by the hopes of a reward , but by the fear of having their negligence to accept it punished , by being compelled into the same service , and forfeiting their claim by staying to be compelled .


Lord BALTIMORE then spoke to the following effect : -- Sir , to the reward proposed in this clause , I have declared in the former conference on this bill , that I have no objection , and , therefore , have no amendment to propose , except with regard to the time limited for the payment .


As our need of seamen , sir , is immediate , why should not a law for their encouragement immediately operate ?
What advantage can arise from delays ?
Or why is not that proper to be advanced now , that will be proper in twenty days ?
That all the time between the enaction and operation of this law must be lost , is evident  for who will enter for two pounds , that may gain five by withholding himself from the service twenty days longer ?


Nor do I think the time now limited sufficient  many sailors who are now in the service of the merchants , may not return soon enough to lay claim to the bounty , who would gladly accept it , and who will either not serve the crown without it , or will serve with disgust and complaints  as the loss of it can not be imputed to their backwardness , but to an accident against which they could not provide .


Mr. WINNINGTON replied : -- Sir , though I think the time now fixed by the bill sufficient , as I hope that our present exigency will be but of short continuance , and that we shall soon be able to raise naval forces at a cheaper rate , yet as the reasons alleged for an alteration of the time may appear to others of more weight than to me , I shall not oppose the amendment .


Sir John BARNARD next rose , and said : -- Sir , with regard to the duration of the time fixed for the advancement of this bounty , we may have leisure to deliberate  but surely it must be readily granted by those who have expatiated so copiously upon the present exigencies of our affairs , that it ought immediately to commence .
And if this be the general determination of the house , nothing can be more proper than to address his majesty to offer , by proclamation , an advance of five pounds , instead of two , which have been hitherto given  that while we are concerting other measures for the advantage of our country , those in which we have already concurred may be put in execution .


Mr. PULTENEY rose up next , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , I take this opportunity to lay before the house a grievance which very much retards the equipment of our fleets , and which must be redressed before any measures for reconciling the sailors to the publick service can be pursued with the least probability of success .


Observation , sir , has informed me , that to remove the detestation of the king 's service , it is not necessary to raise the wages of the seamen  it is necessary only to secure them  it is necessary to destroy those hateful insects that fatten in idleness and debauchery upon the gains of the industrious and honest .


When a sailor , sir , after the fatigues and hazards of a long voyage , brings his ticket to the pay-office , and demands his wages , the despicable wretch to whom he is obliged to apply , looks upon his ticket with an air of importance , acknowledges his right , and demands a reward for present payment  with this demand , however exorbitant , the necessities of his family oblige him to comply .


In this manner , sir , are the wives of the sailors also treated when they come to receive the pay of their husbands  women , distressed , friendless , and unsupported  they are obliged to endure every insult , and to yield to every oppression .
And to such a height do these merciless exacters raise their extortions , that sometimes a third part of the wages is deducted .


Thus , sir , do the vilest , the meanest of mankind , plunder those who have the highest claim to the esteem , the gratitude , and the protection of their country .
This is the hardship which withholds the sailors from our navies , and forces them to seek for kinder treatment in other countries .
This hardship , sir , both justice and prudence call upon us to remedy  and while we neglect it , all our deliberations will be ineffectual .


Mr. SOUTHWELL then spoke to this effect : -- Sir , of the hardships mentioned by the honourable gentleman who spoke last , I have myself known an instance too remarkable not to be mentioned .
A sailor in Ireland , after his voyage , met with so much difficulty in obtaining his wages , that he was at length reduced to the necessity of submitting to the reduction of near a sixth part .
Such are the grievances with which those are oppressed , upon whom the power , security , and happiness of the nation are acknowledged to depend .


Sir Robert WALPOLE , the prime minister , then rose , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , it is not without surprise that I hear the disgust of the sailors ascribed to any irregularity in the payment of their wages , which were never , in any former reign , so punctually discharged .
They receive , at present , twelve months ' pay in eighteen months , without deduction  so that there are never more than six months for which any demand remains unsatisfied .


But , sir , the punctuality of the payment has produced of late great inconveniencies  for there has been frequently a necessity of removing men from one ship to another  and it is the stated rule of the pay-office , to assign every man so removed his full pay .
These men , when the government is no longer indebted to them , take the first opportunity of deserting the service , and engaging in business to which they are more inclined .


This is not a chimerical complaint , founded upon rare instances , and produced only to counterbalance an objection  the fact and the consequences are well known  so well , that near fourteen hundred sailors are computed to have been lost by this practice .


The PRESIDENT of the commons , who always in a committee takes his seat as another member , rose here , and spoke to the following effect , his honour being paymaster of the navy : -- Mr. Chairman , the nature of the employment with which I am intrusted makes it my duty to endeavour that this question may be clearly understood , and the condition of the seamen , with regard to the reception of their pay , justly represented .


I have not been able to discover that any sailor , upon producing his ticket , was ever obliged to submit to the deduction of any part of his wages , nor should any clerk or officer under my inspection , escape , for such oppression , the severest punishment and most publick censure : I would give him up to the law without reserve , and mark him as infamous , and unworthy of any trust or employment .


But there are extortions , sir , by which those unhappy men , after having served their country with honesty and courage , are deprived of their lawful gains of diligence and labour .
There are men to whom it is usual amongst the sailors to mortgage their pay before it becomes due , who never advance their money but upon such terms as can not be mentioned without indignation .
These men advance the sum which is stipulated , and by virtue of a letter of attorney are reimbursed at the pay-office .


This corruption is , I fear , not confined to particular places , but has spread even to America , where , as in his own country , the poor sailor is seduced , by the temptation of present money , to sell his labour to extortioners and usurers .


I appeal to the gentleman , whether the instance which he mentioned was not of this kind .
I appeal to him without apprehension of receiving an answer that can tend to invalidate what I have asserted .


This , sir , is , indeed , a grievance pernicious and oppressive , which no endeavours of mine shall be deficient in attempting to remove  for by this the sailor is condemned , notwithstanding his industry and success , to perpetual poverty , and to labour only for the benefit of his plunderer .


[ The clauses were then read , `` empowering the justices of the peace , etc. to issue warrants to the constables , etc. to make general privy searches , by day or night , for finding out and securing such seamen and seafaring men as lie hid or conceal themselves  and making it lawful for the officers appointed to make such searches , to force open the doors of any house , where they shall suspect such seamen to be concealed , if entrance be not readily admitted  and for punishing those who shall harbour or conceal any seaman . '' ]


Sir John BARNARD upon this rose up , and spoke to the following effect : -- Mr. Chairman , we have been hitherto deliberating upon questions , in which diversity of opinions might naturally be expected , and in which every man might indulge his own opinion , whatever it might be , without any dangerous consequences to the publick .
But the clauses now before us are of a different kind  clauses which can not be read without astonishment and indignation , nor defended without betraying the liberty of the best , the bravest , and most useful of our fellow-subjects .


If these clauses , sir , should pass into a law , a sailor and a slave will become terms of the same signification .
Every man who has devoted himself to the most useful profession , and most dangerous service of his country , will see himself deprived of every advantage which he has laboured to obtain , and made the mere passive property of those who live in security by his valour , and owe to his labour that affluence which hardens them to insensibility , and that pride that swells them to ingratitude .


Why must the sailors alone , sir , be marked out from all the other orders of men for ignominy and misery ?
Why must they be ranked with the enemies of society , stopped like vagabonds , and pursued like the thief and the murderer by publick officers ?
How or when have they forfeited the common privilege of human nature , or the general protection of the laws of their country ?
If it is a just maxim , sir , that he who contributes most to the welfare of the publick , deserves most to be protected in the enjoyment of his private right or fortune  a principle which surely will not be controverted  where is the man that dares stand forth and assert , that he has juster claims than the brave , the honest , the diligent sailor ?


I am extremely unwilling , sir , to engage in so invidious an undertaking as the comparison of the harmless , inoffensive , resolute sailor , with those who think themselves entitled to treat him with contempt , to overlook his merit , invade his liberty , and laugh at his remonstrances .


Nor is it , sir , necessary to dwell upon the peculiar merit of this body of men  it is sufficient that they have the same claims , founded upon the same reasons with our own , that they have never forfeited them by any crime , and , therefore , that they can not be taken away without the most flagrant violation of the laws of nature , of reason , and of our country .


Let us consider the present condition of a sailor , let us reflect a little upon the calamities to which custom , though not law , has already made him subject , and it will surely not be thought that his unhappiness needs any aggravation .


He is already exposed to be forced , upon his return from a tedious voyage , into new hardships , without the intermission of a day , and without the sight of his family  he is liable , after a contract for a pleasing and gainful voyage , to be hurried away from his prospects of interest , and condemned amidst oppression and insolence , to labour and to danger , almost without the possibility of a recompense .
He has neither the privilege of choosing his commander , nor of leaving him when he is defrauded and oppressed .


These , sir , I say , are the calamities to which he is now subject , but there is now a possibility of escaping them .
He is not yet deprived of the right of resistance , or the power of flight  he may now retire to his friend , and be protected by him  he may take shelter in his own cottage , and treat any man as a robber , that shall attempt to force his doors .


When any crews are returning home in time of war , they are acquainted with the dangers of an impress , but they comfort themselves with contriving stratagems to elude it , or with the prospect of obtaining an exemption from it by the favour of their friends  prospects which are often deceitful , and stratagems frequently defeated , but which yet support their spirits , and animate their industry .


But if this bill , sir , should become a law , the sailor , instead of amusing himself on his return with the prospects of ease , or of pleasure , will consider his country as a place of slavery , a residence less to be desired than any other part of the world .
He will probably seek , in the service of some foreign prince , a kinder treatment  and will not fail , in any country but his own , to see himself , at least , on a level with other men .


Nor will this bill , sir , only give the seamen new reasons of disgust , but it will tend , likewise , to aggravate those grievances , which already have produced a detestation of the publick service , scarcely to be conquered .


The officers of the navy , sir , will hardly be made less insolent by an increase of power  they whose tyranny has already alienated their fellow-subjects from the king 's service , though they could only depend upon the character of probity and moderation for the prospect of manning their ships in succeeding expeditions , will probably , when they are animated by a law like this , and made absolute both by land and sea , indulge themselves in the enjoyment of their new authority , contrive new hardships and oppressions , and tyrannise without fear and without mercy .
Thus , sir , will the bill not only be tyrannical in itself , but the parent of tyranny  it will give security to the cruel , and confidence to the arrogant .


That any man , at least any man bred from his infancy to change his residence , and accustomed to different climates and to foreign nations , will fix by choice in that country where he finds the worst reception , is hardly to be imagined .
We see indeed , that men unqualified to support themselves in other countries , or who have , by long custom , contracted a fondness for particular methods of life , will bear very uncomfortable circumstances , without endeavouring to improve their conditions by a change of their habitations .
But the temper of a sailor , acquainted with all parts , and indifferent to all , is of another kind .
Such , sir , is his love of change , arising either from wantonness , or curiosity , that he is hard to be retained by the kindest treatment and most liberal rewards  and will , therefore , never struggle with his habitual dispositions , only to continue in a state of slavery .


I think it , therefore , sir , very evident that this new method of encouraging sailors will be so far from increasing them , that it may probably drive them out of the empire , and at once ruin our trade and our navy  at once beggar and disarm us .


Let me now suppose , sir , for a moment , the bill less pernicious in its consequences , and consider only the difficulties of executing it .
Every seafaring man is to be seized , at pleasure , by the magistrate  but what definition is given of a seafaring man ?
Or by what characteristick is the magistrate to distinguish him ?
I have never been able to discover any peculiarities in the form of a seaman that mark him out from the rest of the species .
There is , indeed , less servility in his air , and less effeminacy in his face , than in those that are commonly to be seen in drawing-rooms , in brothels , and at reviews  but I know not that a seaman can be distinguished from any other man of equal industry or use , who has never enervated himself by vice , nor polished himself into corruption .
So that this bill , sir , if it shall pass into a law , will put it at once in the power of the magistrate to dispose of seamen at his pleasure , and to term whom he pleases a seaman .


Another expedient , sir , has been offered on this occasion , not equally tyrannical , but equally inadequate to the end in view .
It is proposed to restrain the merchants from giving wages beyond a certain rate , on the supposition that the sailors have no motive but that of larger wages , to prefer the service of the merchants to that of the crown .


This , sir , is a mistake which might easily arise from a partial and imperfect knowledge of the affair , with which very few gentlemen have opportunities of being well acquainted .
The wages , sir , are the smallest inducements which fix the seamen in their choice .
The prospect of kinder treatment , the certainty of returning home in a fixed time , and the power of choosing what voyages they will undertake , can not but be acknowledged very reasonable motives of preference .


On the contrary , sir , when they are once engaged in a ship of war , they know neither whither they are going , what dangers they shall encounter , what hardships they shall suffer , nor when they shall be dismissed .


Besides , sir , I do not think it possible by any law to limit the wages to be paid by merchants , since they will change the term of wages into that of a present , or admit the sailors to a small share in the freight , and so all the precaution we can take will become ineffectual .


In the mean time , sir , how much shall we embarrass our own commerce , and impair our natural strength -- the power of our fleets ?
We shall terrify our sailors on the one hand , and endeavour to starve them on the other  we shall not only drive them from us by unheard-of severities , but take away every motive that can induce them to expose themselves to the danger of suffering them .


If we consider , sir , with what effect methods nearly approaching these were practised in the reign of the late queen , we shall find that not more than one thousand five hundred seamen were raised , and those at the expense of more than four thousand pounds  so that the effects bore no proportion to the means  our laws were infringed , and our constitution violated to no purpose .


But what reason , sir , can be assigned for which it must be more difficult to supply the fleet now with sailors than at any other time ?
This war , sir , was demanded by the publick voice , in pursuance of the particular remonstrances of the merchants , and it is not to be supposed that the sailors or any other body of men engage in it with a particular reluctance .


I am , therefore , inclined to believe that the suspicion of great numbers hid in the country , at a distance from the coast , is merely chimerical  and that if we should pass this bill , we should do nothing more than grant an oppressive and unconstitutional power of search for what , in reality , is not to be found .


How oppressive this power may become in the hands of a corrupt or insolent magistrate , any man may discover , who remembers that the magistrate is made judge without appeal , of his own right to denominate any man a sailor , and that he may break open any man 's doors at any time , without alleging any other reason than his own suspicion  so that no man can secure his house from being searched , or , perhaps , his person from being seized .


It may , indeed , be alleged , sir , that this will be only a temporary law , and is to cease with the exigence that made it necessary : but long experience has informed us , that severe laws are enacted more readily than they are repealed  and that most men are too fond of power to suffer willingly the diminution of it .


But , sir , though this law should not be perpetuated , every precedent of an infringement of our constitution , makes way for its dissolution  and the very cessation of an oppressive law , may be a plea , hereafter , for the revival of it .


This bill , therefore , must be confessed to be at once violent and ineffectual  to be a transgression of the laws of justice to particular men , without any prospect of real benefit to the community  and , therefore , can not be passed without deviating at once from prudence and our constitution .


Captain CORNWALL then rose , and spoke to this effect : -- I have observed , sir , that every man is apt to think himself ill treated , who is not treated according to his own opinion of his deserts , and will endeavour to diffuse his own notion of the partiality and tyranny of the naval officers  general clamours , therefore , are little to be regarded .


I have had , from my early years , a command in the sea service , and can assert , that I never knew more than one instance of injustice , and that was punished with the severity which it deserved .


The PRIME MINISTER rose next , and spoke to this effect : -- Mr. Chairman , it is with uncommon satisfaction that I see every clause of this bill regularly debated , without unbecoming impatience , or passionate exclamations .
I am willing to collect from this conduct , that the disposition of every gentleman is , on this occasion , the same with my own  and that every expedient here proposed will be diligently examined , and either be seriously approved , or be calmly rejected .


Such coolness and impartiality , sir , is certainly required by the importance of the present question  a question which can not but influence the prosperity of the nation for many years .


It is not necessary to remind any gentleman of the importance of our trade , of the power of the enemy against whom we have declared war in defence of it , or of the necessity of showing the world that our declarations of war are not empty noises , or farces of resentment .
But it may be proper , sir , to remark , that this is not the only enemy , nor the most powerful , whose attempts we have reason to provide against , and who may oblige us to exert our whole power , and practise every expedient to increase our forces .


The war has been , hitherto , prosecuted with the utmost vigour , with all the attention that its importance requires , and with success not disproportioned to our preparations  nor will it ever be suffered to languish , if the powers necessary for carrying it on are not denied .


Nothing is more evident , sir , than that the natural power of the nation consists in its fleets , which are now , by the care of the government , so numerous , that the united power of many nations can not equal them .
But what are fleets unfurnished with men ?
How will they maintain the dominion of the sea , by lying unactive in our harbours ?


That no methods , hitherto used , have been sufficient to man our navies , and that our preparations have , therefore , been little more than an expensive show of war , the whole nation is sufficiently informed  it is , therefore , not doubtful that some new measures must be taken  whether any better can be suggested than are offered in this bill , must be inquired .


With regard , sir , to the clause now under our consideration , it is to be remembered , that little more is proposed by it , than to add the sanction of legality to a power which has long been exercised by the admiralty , without any other authority than that of long prescription , the power of issuing warrants of impress upon emergent occasions , by which sailors are forced into the publick service .


This power , in its present state , must be allowed to have no foundation in any law , and , by consequence , to be unlimited , arbitrary , and easily abused , and , upon the whole , to be justifiable only by necessity : but that necessity is so frequent , that it is often exercised , and , therefore , ought to be regulated by the legislature  and by making such regulations , we may rather be said to remove than introduce a grievance .


The power of searching for sailors , however it has been represented , is far from setting them on a level with felons , murderers , or vagabonds  or , indeed , from distinguishing them , to their disadvantage , from the rest of the community , of which every individual is obliged to support the government .


Those that possess estates , or carry on trades , transfer part of their property to the publick  and those ought , by parity of reason , to serve the publick in person , that have no property to transfer .
Every man is secured by the constitution in the enjoyment of his life , his liberty , or his fortune  and , therefore , every man ought reciprocally to defend the constitution to which he is himself indebted for safety and protection .


I am , therefore , sir , unable to discover in what consists the hardship of a law by which no new duties are enjoined , nor any thing required , which is not already every man 's duty .
Every man , indeed , who is desirous of evading the performance of any of the duties of society , will consider every compulsion as a hardship , by which he is obliged to contribute to the general happiness  but his murmurs will prove nothing but his own folly and ingratitude , and will certainly deserve no regard from the legislative power .


There is in the bill before us , sir , encouragement sufficient for volunteers , and an offer of greater rewards than some gentlemen think consistent with the present state of the national revenues  and what remains to be done with respect to those who are deaf to all invitations , and blind to all offers of advantage ?
Are they to sit at ease only because they are idle , or to be distinguished with indulgence only for want of deserving it ?


It seems generally granted , sir , that such drones are the proper objects of an impress .
Let us then suppose that every man who is willing to serve his country , has laid hold of the reward proposed , and entered a volunteer .
The fleets are not yet sufficiently manned , and more sailors must be procured .
Warrants are issued out in the common form .
The negligent , the imprudent , the necessitous , are taken .
The vigilant , the cunning , and those that have more money , find shelter and escape .
Can it be said , that those whose circumstances , or good fortune , enable them to secure themselves from the officers of the impress , deserve any exemption from the publick service , or from the hardships to which their companions are exposed ?
Have they discharged their debt of gratitude to the publick so effectually by running away from its service , that no search ought to be made after them ?
It seems evident , that if it was right to seize the one , it is likewise right to pursue the other  and if it be right to pursue him , it is likewise right to hinder him from escaping the pursuers .
It is then right to vest some persons with the power of apprehending him , and in whom is that power to be lodged , but in the civil magistrate ?


Every man , sir , is obliged by compulsive methods to serve his country , if he can be prevailed upon by no other .
If any man shall refuse to pay his rates or his taxes , will not his goods be seized by force , and sold before his face ?
If any particular methods are proposed for obliging seamen to contribute to the publick safety , it is only because their service is necessary upon more pressing occasions than that of others  upon occasions which do not admit of delay , without the hazard of the whole community .


I must confess , sir , there are instances in which the hardships of the seafaring part of the nation are peculiar , and truly calamitous .
A sailor , after the dangers and toils of a long voyage , when he is now in the sight of the port , where he hopes to enjoy that quiet which he has deserved by so long a series of fatigues , to repair the injuries which his health has suffered , by change of climate , and the diet of the ships , and to recover that strength which incessant vigilance has worn away  when he is in expectation of being received by his family with those caresses , which the succours that he brings them naturally produce , and designs to rest awhile from danger and from care  in the midst of these pleasing views , he is , on the sudden , seized by an impress , and forced into a repetition of all his miseries , without any interval of refreshment .


Let no man who can think without compassion on such a scene as this , boast his zeal for freedom , his regard for bravery , or his gratitude to those who contribute to the wealth and power of their country  let every man who declares himself touched with the pity which the slightest reflection upon such a disappointment must naturally produce , sincerely endeavour to obviate the necessity of such oppressive measures , which may , at least in part , be prevented , by assigning to magistrates the power of hunting out of their retreats , those who neglect the business of their callings , and linger at once in laziness and want .


There are great numbers who retire not from weariness but idleness , or an unreasonable prepossession against the publick service  and , surely , nothing is more unreasonable , than that bad dispositions should be gratified , and that industry should expose any man to penalties .


Upon the whole , sir , I am not able to discover , that any man should be exempted from an impress merely because he finds means to escape it , or because idleness or disinclination to the publick service prompts him to abscond .


If any men deserve indulgence , in opposition to the demands of the publick , they are rather those who have already , in some degree , discharged their duty to it , by contributing to bring in that wealth which is the consequence of a prosperous and well-regulated commerce , and without which war can not be supported .


It is not without grief and regret , that I am obliged to represent , on this occasion , the obstructions which the war has suffered from those at whose request it was undertaken  and to declare , that the conduct of the merchants , has afforded proof that some law of this tendency is absolutely necessary .


The merchants , sir , who have so loudly complained of the decline of trade , the interruption of navigation , and the insolence , rapacity , and cruelty of the Spaniards  the merchants , who filled the nation with representations of their hardships , discouragements , and miseries , and lamented in the most publick manner , that they were the only body for whom the legislature had no regard , who were abandoned to the caprice of other nations , were plundered abroad , and neglected at home  the merchants , after having at length by their importunities engaged the state in a war , of which they have themselves certainly not the least pretensions to question either the justice or necessity , now , when by the natural consequences of a naval armament , sailors become less numerous , and ships more difficult to be equipped , contract in private with such sailors as they are inclined to employ , and conceal them in garrets , hired for that purpose , till the freight is ready , or the danger of an impress is past , and thus secure their own private affairs at the hazard of the publick , and hinder the operations of a war , which they , and they only , solicited .


The danger of having other enemies than the Spaniards , enemies , sir , more active , more powerful , and more ambitious , has already been mentioned  a danger so near , and so formidable , that he will not be thought very solicitous for his country , whom the bare mention of it does not alarm .
This danger we are , therefore , to obviate by vigorous preparations , and unanimous resolutions  nor do I doubt but both our enemies , if they find us united , will repent of attacking us .


Sir , the most efficacious method of manning our fleets , which law or custom has yet put into our hands , is that of suspending our commerce by an embargo  and yet the whole nation knows how much , and by what means , it has been eluded : no sooner was it known that an embargo was laid , than the sailors flew away into the country , or hid themselves in corners of this great city , as from the most formidable danger  and no sooner did the embargo cease , than the banks of the river were again crowded with sailors , and all the trading vessels were immediately supplied .


As I can not doubt , sir , that every gentleman is equally zealous for the success of the war , and the prosperity of his country  and as the insufficiency of the present methods of providing for them is apparent , I hope , that either the regulations proposed by this bill , to which I see no important objections , or some other of equal use , will be established by a general concurrence .


Lord BALTIMORE spoke next : -- Though no gentleman in this assembly , sir , can more ardently wish the success of the British arms , or shall more willingly concur in any measure that may promote it , yet I can not agree to the clause now under our consideration  I disapprove it both from moral and political motives  I disapprove it as neither just nor prudent .


The injustice of so flagrant an invasion of the liberty of particular men has been already exposed  nor is it , in my opinion , less easy to discover the imprudence of exhausting all our supplies at once , and sweeping away all our sailors , to supply a single exigency .


It has often been remarked , sir , in favour of a standing army , that it is requisite to have a number of regular forces , who , though too weak to oppose an invasion , might be able to establish discipline in a larger body .
An observation which may , with much greater justness , be applied to the seamen , whose art is much more difficult to be attained , and who are equally necessary in war and peace .


If our stock of seamen , sir , be destroyed , if there is not left in our trading vessels a sufficient number of experienced artists to initiate novices , and propagate the profession , not only our ships of war must lie useless , but our commerce sink to nothing .


Nor have I reason to believe the naval power of France so formidable , as that we ought to be terrified by the apprehensions of it into any extraordinary methods of procedure .
I am informed that they have now very few ships of force left in their harbours  and that they have exerted their whole strength in the American fleet .


I am not , therefore , sir , for providing against present dangers , without regard to our future security  and think nothing more worthy of the consideration of this assembly , than the means of encouraging and increasing our seamen , which will not be effected by the bill before us .


Land forces may be hired upon emergencies  but sailors are our own peculiar strength , and the growth of our own soil  we are , therefore , above all other regards , to attend , if I may use the term , to the preservation of the species .


Mr. VYNER next spoke : -- Mr. Chairman , as there can be no stronger objection to any law than ambiguity , or indeterminate latitude of meaning , I think it necessary to propose , that some word of known and limited import , be substituted in the place of seafaring men  an expression which , if I was asked the meaning of it , I should find it difficult to explain .


Are seafaring men those only who navigate in the sea ?
The term is then superfluous , for all such are evidently comprised in the word seamen .
Are they bargemen or watermen , who ply on rivers and transport provision or commodities from one inland town to another ?
In that sense nobody will affirm that it is a proper word  and impropriety in the expression of laws , produces uncertainty in the execution of them .


Captain CORNWALL rose up : -- Sir , the term seafaring men , of which an explication is desired , is intended to include all those who live by conveying goods or passengers upon the water , whether the sea or inland rivers : nor can we restrain it to a narrower sense , without exempting from the publick service great numbers , whose manner of life has qualified them for it , and from whom their country may , with equal justice , expect assistance , as from those who are engaged in foreign traffick .


Mr. VYNER replied : -- Sir , I am far from concurring with the honourable gentleman in his opinion , that the inland watermen are , by their profession , in any degree qualified for sea service , or can properly be called seafaring men .


All qualifications for the service must consist either in some knowledge of the arts of navigation , or in some familiarity with the dangers of the sea .
With regard to any previous knowledge of naval business , it is well known that they have no advantage over any common labourer  for the manner of navigating a ship and a barge have , for the most part , nothing in common .


Nor are these watermen , sir , more able to stand firm in the terrours of the storm , or the noise of a battle , than those who follow any other occupation .
Many of them never saw the sea , nor have less dread of its danger than the other inhabitants of the inland counties .
They are , therefore , neither seafaring men , nor peculiarly capable of being made seamen .


But the hardship upon particular men is not the strongest objection to this clause , which , by obstructing our inland navigation , may make our rivers useless , and set the whole trade of the nation at a stand .
For who will bring up his son a waterman , who knows him exposed by that profession to be impressed for a seaman ?


It seems , therefore , necessary , sir , either to omit the term seafaring men [ Footnote : Agreed to be omitted . ]
, or to explain it in such a manner , that inland watermen may not be included .


Lord GAGE spoke next : -- Sir , so much has been urged against the compulsive methods proposed in this clause , and so little produced in favour of them , that it may seem superfluous to add any thing , or to endeavour , by a multiplicity of arguments , to prove what common reason must immediately discover .
But there is one consequence of this clause which has not yet been observed , and which is yet too important not to be obviated by a particular proviso .


It is well known , sir , that many of those to whom this act will extend , are freeholders and voters , for electing the representatives of the nation  and it is therefore apparent , that elections may be influenced by an ill-timed or partial execution of it .
How easy will it be , when an election approaches , to raise a false alarm , to propose some secret expedition , or threaten us with an invasion from some unknown country , and to seize on all the seafaring voters whose affections are suspected , and confine them at Spithead till the contest is over .


I can not , therefore , sir , but think it necessary , that if this clause be suffered to pass , some part of its hateful consequences should be prevented by an exception in favour of freeholders and voters , which , surely , is no less than what every man owes to his own security , to the welfare of his country , and to those by whom he has been honoured with the care of their liberties .


Mr. Henry PELHAM then said , as follows : -- Sir , I do not rise in opposition to the proposal made by that right honourable member , nor do I think this the proper time either for opposing or approving it .
Method is of the highest importance in inquiries like these  and if the order of the debate be interrupted by foreign questions , or incidental objections , no man will be able to consider the clauses before us with the attention necessary to his own satisfaction , or to the conviction of others  the mind will be dissipated by a multiplicity of views , and nothing can follow but perplexity and confusion .


The great end , sir , for which we are now assembled , is to strike out methods of manning the fleet with expedition and certainty .
It is , therefore , proper , in the first place , to agree upon some general measures , to each of which there may , undoubtedly , be particular objections raised , that may be afterwards removed by exceptions or provisions  but these provisions should , for the sake of order , be inserted in particular clauses , to be separately considered .


Of this kind is the exception now offered , to which I have no objection but its present impropriety , and the interruption of the debate which it may now occasion  for I see , at present , no reason against admitting it in a particular clause .


When it is considered how much the success of the war may depend upon the determinations of this day , and how much our future happiness and security may depend upon the success of our present undertakings , I hope my solicitude for regularity and expedition will be easily excused .


Sir Hind COTTON answered : -- I am not able , sir , to discover any imminent danger to the nation in suspending our attention to the clause before us , for a few moments  nor , indeed , do we cease to attend to it , while we are endeavouring to mollify it , and adapt it to our constitution .


The exception proposed is , in the opinion of the honourable gentleman , so reasonable , that he declares himself ready to approve it in another place  and , to me , no place seems more proper of its making part of this bill than this .
As a connexion between the clause and exception appears necessary and immediate , I can not see why it should be postponed , unless it is hoped that it may be forgotten .


Mr. PULTENEY then spoke : -- Sir , that this exception should be forgotten there is no danger  for how long soever it be delayed , I will never agree to the act till I see it inserted .
If we suffer the liberty of the freeholders to be infringed , what can we expect but to be charged with betraying our trust , and giving up to servitude and oppression those who deputed us to this assembly , as the guardians of their privileges , and the asserters of their birthright  a charge too just to be denied , and too atrocious to be borne .


Sir , the right of a freeholder is independent on every other circumstance , and is neither made more or less by wealth or poverty : the estate , however small , which gives a right of voting , ought to exempt the owner from every restraint that may hinder the exertion of his right  a right on which our constitution is founded , and which can not be taken away without subverting our whole establishment .


To overlook the distinctions which the fundamental laws of our country have made in respect to different orders of men , and to regard only the accidents of affluence and necessity , is surely unjust in itself , and unworthy of this assembly  an assembly , sir , instituted principally to protect the weak against the strong , and deputed to represent those , in a collective state , who are not considerable enough to appear singly , and claim a voice in the legislature .


To expose an honest , a laborious , and an useful man , to be seized by the hands of an insolent officer , and dragged from the enjoyment of his right , only because he will not violate his conscience , and add his voice to those of sycophants , dependents , and prostitutes , the slaves of power , the drudges of a court , and the hirelings of a faction , is the highest degree of injustice and cruelty .
Let us rather , sir , sweep away , with an impress , the drones of large fortunes , the tyrants of villages , and the oppressors of the poor  let us oblige those to serve their country by force , whose fortunes have had no other effect than to make them insolent and worthless  but let such who , by contributing to commerce , make every day some addition to the publick wealth , be left in the full enjoyment of the rights which they deserve : let those , by whose labour the expenses of the war are furnished , be excused from contributing to it by personal service .


It is necessary , sir , to have our laws established by the representatives of the people  it is necessary that those representatives should be freely elected  and , therefore , every law that obstructs the liberty of voters , is contrary to the fundamental laws of our constitution  and what multitudes may , by this law , be either hindered from giving their votes , or be terrified into such a choice as by no means corresponds with their judgments or inclinations , it is easy to foresee .


I am , indeed , of opinion , sir , that this clause can not be adapted to our constitution , nor modified , by any expedient , into a law , which will not lay insupportable hardships upon the nation , and make way for absolute power .
But as it is necessary that a constant supply of seamen should be provided , I think it not improper to observe , that there is one expedient yet remaining , by which , though it will not much assist us in our present exigence , the fleets of this nation may hereafter be constantly supported .


We have , at present , great numbers of charity schools established in this nation , where the children of the poor receive an education disproportioned to their birth .
This has often no other consequences than to make them unfit for their stations , by placing them , in their own opinion , above the drudgery of daily labour  a notion which is too much indulged , as idleness , cooperating with vanity , can hardly fail to gain the ascendant , and which sometimes prompts them to support themselves by practices not only useless , but pernicious to society .
This evil , sir , can not be better obviated than by allotting a reasonable proportion out of every school to the service of the sea , in which , by entering early , they can not fail to become proficients  and where their attainments , which , at present , too frequently produce laziness and dishonesty , might enable them to excel , and entitle them to promotion .


Mr. WINNINGTON replied : -- Sir , notwithstanding the confidence with which some gentlemen have proposed this amendment , and the easiness with which others have consented to it , I declare , without hesitation , that I oppose it now , and intend to oppose it whenever it shall be offered , because it will defeat all the other provisions which shall be made in the bill .


I will venture to say , sir , that if every man , who has , by whatever tenure , the right of voting , shall be exempted from the necessity of contributing to the publick safety by his personal service , every man qualified for the sea will by some means acquire a vote .


Sir , a very small part of those who give their votes in this nation for representatives in senate , enjoy that right as the appendage of a freehold  to live in some towns , and to be born only in others , gives the unalienable privilege of voting .
Any gentleman , to secure his own interest , or obstruct the publick service , may , by dividing a small piece of barren ground among a hundred sailors , exalt them all to freeholders , and exempt them from the influence of this law .


However , sir , I am not less a friend to the freeholders than those who propose the exception in their favour , but , in my opinion , the great interest of the freeholders is the preservation of their freeholds , which can only be secured by a vigorous exertion of the power of the nation , in the war which is now declared against the Spaniards .


Mr. BARRINGTON spoke next : -- Sir , by the observations which I have opportunities of making at the place which I have the honour to represent , I am convinced of the influence that this law will have upon all the boroughs along the coasts .
There , most of the voters are , in one sense or other , sir , seafaring men , being , almost all of them , owners of vessels , and in some degree acquainted with navigation  they may , therefore , be hurried away at the choice of an officious or oppressive magistrate , who may , by partiality and injustice , obtain a majority , contrary to the general inclination of the people , and determine the election by his own authority .


Sir William YONGE then said : -- Sir , if every freeholder and voter is to be exempted from the influence of the law , the bill that we are with so much ardour endeavouring to draw up and rectify , and of which the necessity is so generally acknowledged , will be no other than an empty sound , and a determination without an object  for while we are empowering the government to call seamen into the service , we are exempting almost all that are able to serve from the denomination of seamen : what is this but to dispute without a subject ?
to raise with one hand and demolish with the other ?


In the western parts of the nation , sir , where I reside , many who vote at elections claim their privilege by no other title than that of boiling a pot  a title which he who has it not , may easily obtain , when it will either gratify his laziness or his cowardice , and which , though not occasionally obtained , seems not sufficient to set any man out of the reach of a just and necessary law .


It is , therefore , sir , undoubtedly requisite that the terms of the exception should be explicit and definitive , and that only those should be exempted who have such possessions or qualifications as this assembly shall think a just title to exemption .
For on the western coast , from whence great supplies may be expected , almost every sailor has a vote , to which nothing is there required but to hire a lodging , and boil a pot  after which , if this exception be admitted in all its latitude , he may sit at ease amidst the distresses of his country , ridicule the law which he has eluded , and set the magistrate at open defiance .


The PRIME MINISTER spoke next : -- As I think , Sir , some exception may be just and proper , so I suppose every gentleman will concur with me in rejecting one of such extent as shall leave no object for the operation of the law .


It is , in my opinion , proper to restrain the exemption to those freeholders who are possessed of such an estate as gives a vote for the representative of the county , by which those whose privilege arises from their property will be secured  and it seems reasonable that those who have privileges without property , should purchase them by their services .


Counsellor BROWN spoke next : -- Sir , the exception proposed will not only defeat the end of the bill , by leaving it few objects , but will obstruct the execution of it on proper occasions , and involve the magistrate in difficulties which will either intimidate him in the exertion of his authority , or , if he persists in discharging his duty with firmness and spirit , will perhaps oblige him sometimes to repent of his fidelity .


It is the necessary consequence , sir , of a seaman 's profession , that he is often at a great distance from the place of his legal settlement , or patrimonial possessions  and he may , therefore , assert of his own circumstances what is most convenient , without danger of detection .
Distance is a security that prompts many men to falsehoods , by which only vanity is gratified  and few men will tell truth in opposition to their interest , when they may lie without apprehension of being convicted .


When , therefore , a magistrate receives directions to impress all the seamen within his district , how few will he find who will not declare themselves freeholders in some distant county , or freemen of some obscure borough .
It is to no purpose , sir , that the magistrate disbelieves what he can not confute  and if in one instance in a hundred he should be mistaken , and , acting in consequence of his errour , force a freeman into the service , what reparation may not be demanded ?


I , therefore , propose it to the consideration of the committee , whether any man ought to claim exemption from this law by a title , that may so readily be procured , or so safely usurped .


The ATTORNEY GENERAL spoke next : -- Sir , the practice of impressing , which has been declaimed against with such vehement exaggerations , is not only founded on immemorial custom , which makes it part of the common law , but is likewise established by our statutes  for I remember to have found it in the statutes of queen Mary , and therefore can not allow that it ought to be treated as illegal , and anti-constitutional .


That it is not inconsistent with our constitution may be proved from the practice of erecting the royal standard , upon great emergencies , to which every man was obliged immediately to repair  this practice is as old as our constitution , and as it may be revived at pleasure , may be properly mentioned as equivalent to an impress .


Mr. VYNER answered : -- This word , sir , which the learned member has by his wonderful diligence discovered in the statutes , may perhaps be there , but in a signification far different from that which it bears at present .
The word was , without doubt , originally French , prêt , and implied what is now expressed by the term ready  and to impress any man was in those days only to make him ready , or engage him to hold himself in readiness , which was brought about not by compulsion , pursuit , and violence , but by the allurements of a pecuniary reward , or the obligation of some ancient tenure .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 9 , 1740-1 .


On the sixty-sixth day , the consideration of the bill for raising seamen was resumed , and a clause read , by which every constable , headborough , tithingman , or other person , was liable to be examined upon oath by the justices of peace , who were empowered to lay a fine upon them for any neglect , offence , or connivance .


Sir John BARNARD rose up , and spoke to the following effect : -- Mr. Chairman , it is the peculiar happiness of the Britons , that no law can be made without the consent of their representatives , and I hope no such infatuation can ever fall upon them as may influence them to choose a representative capable of concurring in absurdities like this .


The folly , the iniquity , the stupidity of this clause , can only be conceived by hearing it repeated  it is too flagrant to be extenuated , and too gross to admit exaggerations : to oblige a man to make oath against himself , to subject himself by his own voice to penalties and hardships , is at once cruel and ridiculous , a wild complication of tyranny and folly .


To call upon any man to accuse himself , is only to call upon him to commit perjury , and has therefore been always accounted irrational and wicked : in those countries where it is practised , the confession is extorted by the rack , which indeed is so necessary on such occasions , that I should not wonder to hear the promoters of this clause openly declaring for the expediency of tortures .


Nothing is more evident than that this bill , however the importance of the occasion may be magnified , was drawn up without reflection , and that the clauses were never understood by those that offered them : errours like these must arise only from precipitation and neglect , for they are too gross to be committed either by ignorance or design .


To expose such absurdities is , indeed , easy , but not pleasing  for what end is answered by pointing at folly , or how is the publick service advanced by showing that the methods proposed are totally to be rejected ?
Where a proposition is of a mixed kind , and only erroneous in part , it is an useful and no disagreeable task to separate truth from errour , and disentangle from ill consequences such measures as may be pursued with advantage to the publick  but mere stupidity can only produce compassion , and afford no opportunities for inquiry or dispute .


Admiral WAGER replied : -- Sir , this clause , however contemptuously treated , has been already passed into a law by a senate which brought no dishonour upon the British nation , by a senate which was courted and dreaded by the greatest part of the universe , and was drawn up by a ministry that have given their posterity no reason to treat them with derision and contumely .


In the reign of the late great queen , this method of proceeding was approved and established , and we may judge of the propriety of the measures followed in that war by the success which they procured .


Those , therefore , by whom this bill was drawn up have committed no new absurdities , nor have proposed any thing which was not enacted by the wisest of our predecessors , in one of the most illustrious periods of our history .


Mr. GYBBON answered : -- Sir , I am far from thinking a proposition sufficiently defended by an assertion that it was admitted by our predecessors  for though I have no inclination to vilify their memory , I may without scruple affirm , that they had no pretensions to infallibility , and that there are in many of our statutes instances of such ignorance , credulity , weakness , and errour , as can not be considered without astonishment .


In questions of an abstruse and complicated nature , it is certain , sir , that experience has taught us what could never have been discovered previously by the wisdom of our ancestors  and we have found , by their consequences , the impropriety of many practices which they approved , and which we should have equally applauded in the same circumstances .


But to what purpose is observation , if we must shut our eyes against it , and appeal for ever to the wisdom of our ancestors ?
-- if we must fall into errour , merely because they were mistaken , and rush upon rocks out of veneration to those who were wrecked against them .


In questions easily to be examined , and determinations which comprised no perplexing contrarieties of interest , or multiplicity of circumstances , they were equally liable with ourselves to be supine and negligent , to sink into security , or be surprised by haste .
That the clause now before us was enacted by them , must be ascribed merely to the hurry of the session in which it was brought before them  a time in which so many inquiries of the highest importance were to be made , and great diversity of views to be regarded , that it is no wonder that some absurdities should escape without detection .


In the fourth of the reign of the queen , this bill was brought in , as now , at the latter end of a session , when the attention of the senate was fatigued and distracted  and it was hurried through both houses , and ratified by the queen , with very little consideration .


But then , as this circumstance may be justly termed an extenuation of their errour , it ought to be a lesson of caution to us , that we may not be , in the like manner , betrayed into the same weakness .


Mr. Henry PELHAM next rose up : -- Sir , the conduct of our predecessors seems not to stand in need of any excuse  for it might be easy to vindicate it by arguments , but that it is more proper to approve it by imitation .


Whenever the bill was passed , or how hastily soever the law was enacted , it was , I believe , rather the effect of necessity than of inadvertency  of the same necessity which now presses , and which is very ill consulted by tedious debates .


They were then involved in a war , and were not so distracted by private interests as not to unite in the most vigorous opposition of their enemies .
They knew that the publick good is often promoted by the temporary inconveniencies of individuals  and when affairs of the highest importance demanded their attention , when the security of the whole nation and the happiness of their posterity were the subject of their inquiries , they wisely suffered less considerations to pass , without superfluous and unseasonable solicitude .


How justly they reasoned , sir , and what vigour their resolutions gave to the military operations , our victories are a sufficient proof : and if experience be the surest guide , it can not be improper to imitate those who , in the same circumstances with ourselves , found means to raise the honour , and improve the commerce of their country .


That our circumstances are the same with those of the senate by which this law was made , is obvious beyond dispute  or where they vary , the difference is , perhaps , to our disadvantage .
We have , sir , the same enemies , or , at least , have reason to apprehend the same  but have little hope of the same allies .
The present war is to be carried on at a greater distance , and in more places at the same instant  we can not , therefore , supply our ships occasionally , but must raise great numbers in a short time .


If , therefore , it was then concluded , that the method under our examination was useful  if measures , not eligible in themselves , may be authorized by necessity , why may not we , in compliance with the same exigencies , have recourse to the same expedients ?


Sir William YONGE then spoke : -- Sir , how much weight is added to the determinations of the senate , by the dignity of their procedure , and the decency of their disputations , a slight knowledge of mankind is sufficient to evince .
It is well known that government is supported by opinion  and that he who destroys the reputation , destroys the authority of the legislative power .
Nor is it less apparent , that he who degrades debate into scurrility , and destroys the solemnity of consultation , endeavours to sink the senate into contempt .


It was , therefore , sir , with indignation and surprise , that I heard the clause before us censured with such indecency of language , and the authors of it treated with contumelies and reproaches that mere errour does not deserve , however apparent , but which were now vented before any errour was detected .


I know not , sir , why the gentlemen , who are thus indecently attacked , have suffered such reproaches without censure , and without reply .
I know not why they have omitted to put the honourable gentleman in mind of the respect due to this assembly , or to the characters of those whom he opposes  gentlemen equally skilled with himself in the subject of our inquiries , and whom his own attainments , however large , or his abilities , however comprehensive , can not give him a right to charge with ignorance or folly .


To reproach men with incapacity , is a cheap method of answering their arguments  but a method which the rules of this house ought to exclude from our debates , as the general civility of the world has banished it from every other place of concourse or conversation .


I , for my part , sir , shall always endeavour to confine my attention to the question before us , without suffering my reason to be biassed , or my inquiries diverted by low altercations , or personal animosities  nor when any other man deviates into reproachful and contemptuous language , shall I be induced to think more highly of either his arguments or capacity .


Sir John BARNARD replied : -- Sir , I have always heard it represented as an instance of integrity , when the tongue and heart move in concert , when the words are representations of the sentiments  and have , therefore , hitherto , endeavoured to explain my arguments with perspicuity , and impress my sentiments with force  I have thought it hypocrisy to treat stupidity with reverence , or to honour nonsense with the ceremony of a confutation .
As knavery , so folly , that is not reclaimable , is to be speedily despatched  business is to be freed from obstruction , and society from a nuisance .


Nor , sir , when I am censured by those whom I may offend , by the use of terms correspondent with my ideas , will I , by a tame and silent submission , give reason to suspect that I am conscious of a fault , but will treat the accusation with open contempt , and show no greater regard to the abettors , than to the authors of absurdity .


That decency is of great use in publick debates , I shall readily allow  it may sometimes shelter folly from ridicule , and preserve villany from publick detection  nor is it ever more carefully supported , than when measures are promoted that nothing can preserve from contempt , but the solemnity with which they are established .


Decency is a proper circumstance  but liberty is the essence of senatorial disquisitions : liberty is the parent of truth  but truth and decency are sometimes at variance : all men and all propositions are to be treated here as they deserve  and there are many who have no claim either to respect or decency .


Mr. WINNINGTON then rose : -- Sir , that it is improper in its own nature , and inconsistent with our constitution , to lay any man under an obligation to accuse himself , can not be denied  it is , therefore , evident , that some amendment is necessary to the clause before us .


I have , for this reason , drawn up an amendment , sir , which , if approved by the committee , will , in my opinion , remove all the objections to this part of the bill , and , by reconciling it with our natural and legal rights , I hope , induce those to approve it , who have hitherto opposed it .


I therefore propose , that these words should be substituted instead of those which are the subject of the debate  or some other to this purpose : That no person shall be liable to be fined by virtue of this act , unless a witness , being examined , shall make oath of the misdemeanour or neglect .


Thus the necessity of examining men upon oath in their own cause will be entirely taken away  and , as the clause will then stand , there will remain no suspicion of injustice , or oppression , because none can be practised without the concurrence of many persons of different interests .


[ This clause , though agreed to in the committee , was at last rejected . ]


Mr. Horace WALPOLE spoke next , to this effect : -- Mr. Chairman , it does not yet appear that the gentlemen who have engaged in this debate , have sufficiently attended to the exigence of our affairs , and the importance of the question .
They have lavished their oratory in declaiming upon the absurdity of the methods proposed , and discovered their sagacity , by showing how future navies may be supplied from charity schools , but have substituted no expedients in the place of those which they so warmly condemn , nor have condescended to inform us , how we may now guard our coasts , or man our fleets for immediate service .


There are some circumstances , sir , of the present war , which make our necessity of raising sea forces greater than in those of William , and Anne that succeeded him .
The chief advantages that we gained over the French , in their wars , were the consequences of our victories by land .


At sea , sir , the balance was almost equal , though the Dutch fleet and ours were united  nor did they quit the sea because their fleets were destroyed , but because they were obliged to recruit their land forces with their sailors .
Should they now declare war against us , they would be under no such necessity of defrauding the sea service , for they have now on foot an army of one hundred and sixty thousand men , which are maintained at no greater expense than forty thousand , by the British government  as they are , therefore , sir , so formidable by land , we have no way of opposing them but by our sea forces .


Nor is their navy so contemptible as some have , either by conjecture or misinformation , represented it .
The fleet which they have despatched to America , consists not of fewer than twenty ships , of which the least carry sixty guns , and they are fitting out now an equal number in their own ports  besides , their East India company is obliged to furnish ten ships of the line , at the demand of the government .


Thus it appears that we have neighbours sufficiently powerful to alarm us with the sense of immediate danger  danger which is made more imminent by the expeditious methods by which the French man their fleets , and which we must imitate if we hope to oppose them with success .


I need not say how little we can depend upon any professions of neutrality , which will be best observed when they can not be securely violated  or upon the pacifick inclination of their minister , which interest , persuasion , or caprice , may alter , and to which it is not very honourable to trust for safety .
How can that nation sink lower , which is only free because it is not invaded by its neighbours  and retains its possessions , only because no other has leisure or inclination to take them away ?


If it be asked , what can provoke the French to interrupt us in the prosecution of our designs , and in the punishment of those who have plundered and insulted us , it is not only easy to urge the strict alliance between the two crowns , the ties of blood , the conformity of interests , and their equal hatred of the Britons , but another more immediate reason may be added .
It is suspected , that under pretence of vindicating our own rights , we are endeavouring to gain the possession of the Spanish dominions , and engross the wealth of the new world  and that , therefore , it is the interest of every power , whose subjects traffick to those countries , to oppose us .


Thus , whether we succeed or fail in our attempts upon America , we have the French power to apprehend .
If we make conquests , they may , probably , think it necessary to obviate the torrent of our victories , and to hinder the increase of our dominions , that they may secure their own trade , and maintain their own influence .


If we should be defeated , of which no man , sir , can deny the possibility , the inclination of all to insult the depressed , and to push down the falling , is well known  nor can it be expected that our hereditary enemies would neglect so fair an opportunity of attacking us .


How they might ravage our coasts , and obstruct our trade  how they might triumph in the Channel , and block us up in our own ports , bombard our towns , and threaten us with invasions , I hope I need but barely mention , to incite this assembly to such despatch in manning our fleets , as may secure us at once from insults and from terrour .


It is , undoubtedly , sir , in our power to raise a naval force sufficient to awe the ocean , and restrain the most daring of our enemies from any attempts against us  but this can not be effected by harangues , objections , and disputations .


There is nothing , sir , more frequently the subject of raillery or declamation , than the uselessness or danger of a standing army , to which I declare myself no otherwise inclined than by my concern for the common safety  I willingly allow that not one soldier ought to be supported by the publick , whose service is not necessary  but surely none of those who declare so warmly for the honour and privileges of their country , would expose it to the insults of foreign powers , without defence .
If , therefore , they think the danger of land forces more than equivalent to the benefit , they ought unanimously to concur in the increase of our naval strength , by which they may be protected , but can not be oppressed : they ought willingly to give their assistance to any propositions for making the fleet , formidable , that their declarations against the army may not be thought to proceed from a resolution to obstruct the measures of the government , rather than from zeal for the constitution .
For he that equally opposes the establishment of the army , and the improvement of the navy , declares in effect against the security of the nation  and though , perhaps , without design , exposes his countrymen to the mercy of their enemies .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke next : -- Sir , I can not discover for what reason the bill before us is so vigorously supported , but must observe , that I have seldom known such vehement and continued efforts produced by mere publick spirit , and unmingled regard for the happiness of the nation .
Nothing , sir , that can be urged in favour of the measures now proposed has been omitted .
When arguments are confuted , precedents are cited  when precedents fail , the advocates for the bill have recourse to terrour and necessity , and endeavour to frighten those whom they can not convince .


But , perhaps , sir , these formidable phantoms may soon be put to flight , and , like the other illusions of cowardice , disappear before the light .
Perhaps this necessity will be found only chimerical  and these dangers appear only the visions of credulity , or the bugbears of imposture .


To arrive at a clear view of our present condition , it will be necessary , sir , not to amuse ourselves with general assertions , or overwhelm our reason by terrifying exaggerations : let us consider distinctly the power and the conduct of our enemies , and inquire whether they do not affright us more than they are able to hurt us .


That the force of Spain alone , sir , is much to be dreaded , no man will assert  for that empire , it is well known , has long been seized with all the symptoms of declining power , and has been supported , not by its own strength , but by the interests of its neighbours .
The vast dominions of the Spaniards are only an empty show  they are lands without inhabitants , and , by consequence , without defence  they are rather excrescences , than members of the monarchy , and receive support rather than communicate .
In the distant branches of their empire the government languishes , as the vital motion in an expiring body  and the struggles which they now make , may be termed rather agonies than efforts .


From Spain , therefore , unassisted , we have nothing to apprehend , and yet from thence we have been threatened with insults and invasions .


That the condition of the French is far different , can not be denied  their commerce flourishes , their dominions are connected , their wealth increases , and their government operates with full vigour : their influence is great , and their name formidable .
But I can not allow , sir , that they have yet attained such a height of power as should alarm us with constant apprehensions , or that we ought to secure ourselves against them by the violation of our liberties .
Not to urge that the loss of freedom , and the destruction of our constitution , are the worst consequences that can be apprehended from a conquest , and that to a slave the change of his master is of no great importance , it is evident , that the power of the French is of such kind as can only affect us remotely , and consequentially .
They may fill the continent with alarms , and ravage the territories of Germany , by their numerous armies , but can only injure us by means of their fleets .
We may wait , sir , without a panick terrour , though not without some degree of anxiety , the event of their attempts upon the neighbouring princes , and can not be reduced to fight for our altars and our houses , but by a second armada , which , even then , the winds must favour , and a thousand circumstances concur to expedite .


But that no such fleet can be fitted out by the united endeavours of the whole world  that our navy , in its present state , is superiour to any that can be brought against us , our ministers ought not to be ignorant : and , therefore , to dispirit the nation with apprehensions of armies hovering in the air , and of conquerors to be wafted over by supernatural means , is to destroy that happiness which government was ordained to preserve  to sink us to tameness and cowardice  and to betray us to insults and to robberies .


If our danger , sir , be such as has been represented , to whom must we impute it ?
Upon whom are our weakness , our poverty , and our miseries to be charged ?
Upon whom , but those who have usurped the direction of affairs which they did not understand , or to which their solicitude for the preservation of their own power hindered them from attending ?


That the Spaniards , sir , are now enabled to make resistance , and , perhaps , to insult and depopulate our colonies  that the French have despatched a fleet into the American seas , to obstruct , as may be conjectured , the progress of our arms , and that we are in danger of meeting opposition which we did not expect , is too evident to be concealed .


But , sir , is not the spirit of our enemies the consequence rather of our cowardice than of their own strength ?
Does not the opposition to our designs , by whatever nation it shall be made , arise from the contempt which has been brought upon us by our irresolution , forbearance , and delays ?
Had we resented the first insult , and repaired our earliest losses by vigorous reprisals , our merchants had long ago carried on their traffick with security , our enemies would have courted us with respect , and our allies supported us with confidence .


Our negotiations , treaties , proposals , and concessions , not only afforded them leisure to collect their forces , equip their fleets , and fortify their coasts  but gave them , likewise , spirit to resist those who could not be conquered but by their own cowardice and folly .
By our ill-timed patience , and lingering preparations , we encouraged those to unite against us , who would , otherwise , have only hated us in secret  and deterred those from declaring in our favour , whom interest or gratitude might have inclined to assist us .
For who will support those from whom no mutual support can be expected ?
And who will expect that those will defend their allies , who desert themselves ?


But , sir , however late our resentment was awakened , had the war been prosecuted vigorously after it was declared , we might have been now secure from danger , and freed from suspense , nor would any thing have remained but to give laws to our enemies .


From the success of Vernon with so inconsiderable forces , we may conjecture what would have been performed with an armament proportioned to his undertaking  and why he was not better supplied , no reason has yet been given  nor can it be easily discovered why we either did not begin the war before our enemies had concerted their measures , or delay it till we had formed our own .


Notwithstanding some opportunities have been neglected , and all the advantages of a sudden attack have been irrecoverably lost  notwithstanding our friends , sir , have learned to despise and neglect us , and our enemies are animated to confidence and obstinacy , yet our real and intrinsick strength continues the same  nor are there yet any preparations made against us by the enemy , with views beyond their own security and defence .
It does not yet appear , sir , that our enemies , however insolent , look upon us as the proper objects of a conquest , or that they imagine it possible to besiege us in our own ports , or to confine us to the defence of our own country .
We are not , therefore , to have recourse to measures , which , if they are ever to be admitted , can be justified by nothing but the utmost distress , and can only become proper , as the last and desperate expedient .
The enemy , sir , ought to appear not only in our seas , but in our ports , before it can be necessary that one part of the nation should be enslaved for the preservation of the rest .


To destroy any part of the community , while it is in our power to preserve the whole , is certainly absurd , and inconsistent with the equity and tenderness of a good government : and what is slavery less than destruction ?
What greater calamity has that man to expect , who has been already deprived of his liberty , and reduced to a level with thieves and murderers ?
With what spirit , sir , will he draw his sword upon his invaders , who has nothing to defend ?
Or why should he repel the injuries which will make no addition to his misery , and will fall only on those to whom he is enslaved ?


It is well known that gratitude is the foundation of our duty to our country , and to our superiours , whom we are obliged to protect upon some occasions , because , upon others , we receive protection from them , and are maintained in the quiet possession of our fortunes , and the security of our lives .
But what gratitude is due to his country from a man distinguished , without a crime , by the legislature , from the rest of the people , and marked out for hardships and oppressions ?
From a man who is condemned to labour and to danger , only that others may fatten with indolence , and slumber without anxiety ?
From a man who is dragged to misery without reward , and hunted from his retreat , as the property of his master ?


Where gratitude , sir , is not the motive of action , which may easily happen in minds not accustomed to observe the ends of government , and relations of society , interest never fails to preside , which may be distinguished from gratitude , as it regards the immediate consequences of actions , and confines the view to present advantages .
But what interest can be gratified by a man who is not master of his own actions , nor secure in the enjoyment of his acquisitions ?
Why should he be solicitous to increase his property , who may be torn from the possession of it in a moment ?
Or upon what motive can he act who will not become more happy by doing his duty ?


Many of those to whom this bill is proposed to extend , have raised fortunes at the expense of their ease , and at the hazard of their lives  and now sit at rest , enjoying the memory of their past hardships , and inciting others to the prosecution of the same adventures .
How will it be more reasonable to drag these men from their houses , than to seize any other gentleman upon his own estate ?
and how negligently will our navigation and our commerce be promoted , when it is discovered that either wealth can not be gained by them , or , if so gained , can not be enjoyed .


But it is still urged , sir , that there is a necessity of manning the fleet  a necessity which , indeed , can not totally be denied , though a short delay would produce no frightful consequences , would expose us to no invasions , nor disable us from prosecuting the war .
Yet , as the necessity at least deserves the regard of the legislature , let us consider what motives have hitherto gained men over to the publick service  let us examine how our land forces are raised , and how our merchants equip their ships .
How is all this to be effected without murmurs , mutinies , or discontent , but by the natural and easy method of offering rewards ?


It may be objected , sir , that rewards have been already proposed without effect  but , not to mention the corrupt arts which have been made use of to elude that promise , by rejecting those that came to claim them , we can infer from their inefficacy only , that they were too small  that they were not sufficient to dazzle the attention , and withdraw it from the prospect of the distant advantages which may arise from the service of the merchants .
Let the reward , therefore , be doubled , and if it be not then sufficient , doubled anew .
There is nothing but may be bought , if an adequate price is offered  and we are , therefore , to raise the reward , till it shall be adjudged by the sailors equivalent to the inconveniencies of the service .


Let no man urge , that this is profusion  that it is a breach of our trust , and a prodigality of the publick money .
Sir , the money thus paid is the price of liberty  it is disbursed to hinder slavery from encroaching , to preserve our natural rights from infraction , and the constitution of our country from violation .
If we vote away the privilege of one class among us , those of another may quickly be demanded  and slavery will advance by degrees , till the last remains of freedom shall be lost .


But perhaps , sir , it will appear , upon reflection , that even this method needs not to be practised .
It is well known , that it is not necessary for the whole crew of a ship to be expert sailors  there must be some novices , and many whose employment has more of labour than of art .
We have now a numerous army , which burdens our country , without defending it , and from whom we may , therefore , draw supplies for the fleet , and distribute them amongst the ships in just proportions  they may immediately assist the seamen , and will become able , in a short time , to train up others .


It will , doubtless , sir , be objected to this proposal , that the continent is in confusion , and that we ought to continue such a force as may enable us to assist our allies , maintain our influence , and turn the scale of affairs in the neighbouring countries .
I know not how we are indebted to our allies , or by what ties we are obliged to assist those who never assisted us  nor can I , upon mature consideration , think it necessary to be always gazing on the continent , watching the motions of every potentate , and anxiously attentive to every revolution .
There is no end , sir , of obviating contingencies , of attempting to secure ourselves from every possibility of danger .
I am , indeed , desirous that our friends , if any there be that deserve that name , should succeed in their designs , and be protected in their claims  but think it ought always to be remembered , that our own affairs affect us immediately , theirs only by consequence , and that the nearest danger is to be first regarded .


With respect to the amendment offered to this clause , I can not see that it will produce any advantage , nor think any evidence sufficient to justify the breach of our constitution , or subject any man to the hardship of having his dwelling entered by force .


And , sir , I am not entirely satisfied of the impartiality and equity with which it is promised that this law will be put in execution , or what new influence is to cooperate with this law , by which corruption and oppression will be prevented .


It is well known , sir , that many other laws are made ineffectual by partiality or negligence , which remarkably appears by the immense quantities of corn that are daily carried into foreign countries , by illegal exportations , by which traffick I am informed that we obtain most of our foreign gold , which , in reality , is paid us for corn by the Dutch  though it is studiously represented to the nation as gained by our traffick with Portugal .
Who can assure us that this law will not be perverted , after the example of others ?
and that there will not be wretches found that may employ it to the extortion of money , or the gratification of revenge ?


Thus , sir , I have shown by what means our fleet may now be equipped , and how a supply of sailors may be perpetuated  for I can not think how the boys which are educated in charity schools can be more properly employed .
A proportion may be easily selected for the service , who will benefit the publick much more than by serving sharpers and attorneys , and pilfering either at low gaming houses , or in the inns of court .


Since , therefore , it is not pretended , sir , that this bill can be justified otherwise than by necessity , and it appears that supplies may be raised by other means  since , instead of increasing and encouraging seamen , nothing is proposed that does not manifestly tend , by depressing and harassing them , to diminish their numbers , I think it reasonable to declare that I shall continue to oppose it , and hope that every friend of liberty , or commerce , will concur in the opposition .


Sir Robert WALPOLE spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , I have considered the bill before us with the utmost impartiality , and I can see no reason to apprehend that it will produce such universal discontent , and give occasion to so many abuses , as the honourable gentlemen by whom it is opposed , appear to suspect .
It is not uncommon , sir , in judging of future events , and tracing effects from causes , for the most sagacious to be mistaken .


The safest method of conjecturing upon the future , is to consider the past , for it is always probable , that from like causes like consequences will arise .
Let us , therefore , sir , examine what injustice or oppression has been hitherto produced by laws of the same kind .


The power of searching , however it is now become the subject of loud exclamation and pathetick harangues , is no new invasion of the rights of the people , but has been already granted in its utmost extent , for an end of no greater importance than the preservation of the game .
This formidable authority has been already trusted to the magistrate , and the nation has been already subjected to this insupportable tyranny , only lest the hares and partridges should be destroyed , and gentlemen be obliged to disband their hounds and dismiss their setting dogs .
Yet , sir , even with regard to this power , thus exorbitant , and thus lightly granted , I have heard no general complaints , nor believe that it is looked upon as a grievance by any , but those whom it restrains from living upon the game , and condemns to maintain themselves by a more honest and useful industry .


I hope , sir , those that think this law for the preservation of their amusement , rational and just , will have at least the same regard to the defence of their country , and will not think their venison deserves greater solicitude than their fortunes and their liberties .


Nor is it difficult , sir , to produce instances of the exercise of this power , for the end which is now proposed , without any consequences that should discourage us from repeating the experiment .
I have now in my hand a letter , by which the mayor and aldermen of Bristol are empowered to seize all the sailors within the bounds of their jurisdiction , which order was executed without any outcries of oppression , or apprehensions of the approach of slavery .


That this law , sir , will be always executed with the strictest impartiality , and without the least regard to any private purposes , can not , indeed , be demonstratively proved  every law may possibly be abused by a combination of profligates  but it must , I think , be granted , that it is drawn up with all the caution that reason , or justice , or the corruption of the present age requires .
I know not what can be contrived better than an association of men , unlikely to concur in their views and interests -- a justice of the peace , a lieutenant of a ship , and a commissioner of the navy -- three men , probably unknown to each other , and of which no one will be at all solicitous to desire the rest to unite to commit a crime , to which no temptation can be readily imagined .


This caution , sir , which can not but be approved , and which surely is some proof of judgment and consideration , ought , in my opinion , to have exempted the bill , and those by whose assistance it was drawn up , from the reproachful and indecent charge of absurdity , ignorance , and incapacity  terms which the dignity of this assembly does not admit , even when they are incontestably just , and which surely ought not to be made use of when the question is of a doubtful nature .


The gentlemen , sir , who are now intrusted with publick employments , have never yet discovered that they are inferiour to their predecessors in knowledge or integrity  nor do their characters suffer any diminution by a comparison with those who vilify and traduce them .


Those , sir , that treat others with such licentious contempt , ought surely to give some illustrious proof of their own abilities  and yet if we examine what has been produced on this question , we shall find no reason to admire their sagacity or their knowledge .


We have been told , sir , that the fleet might properly be manned by a detachment from the army  but it has not been proved that we have any superfluous forces in the kingdom , nor , indeed , will our army be found sufficiently numerous , if , by neglecting to equip our fleet , we give our enemies an opportunity of entering our country .


If it be inquired what necessity there is for our present forces ?
What expeditions are designed ?
Or what dangers are feared ?
I shall not think it my duty to return any answer .
It is , sir , the great unhappiness of our constitution , that our determinations can not be kept secret , and that our enemies may always form conjectures of our designs , by knowing our preparations  but surely more is not to be published than necessity extorts , and the government has a right to conceal what it would injure the nation to discover .


Nor can I , sir , approve the method of levying sailors by the incitement of an exorbitant reward , a reward to be augmented at the pleasure of those who are to receive it .
For what can be the consequence of such prodigality , but that those to whom the largest sum is offered , will yet refuse their service in expectation of a greater .
The reward already proposed is , in my opinion , the utmost stretch of liberality  and all beyond may be censured as profusion .


It is not to be imagined , sir , that all these objections were not made , and answered , in the reign of the late queen , when a bill of the same nature was proposed  they were answered , at least , by the necessity of those times , which necessity has now returned upon us .


We do not find that it produced any consequences so formidable and destructive , that they should for ever discourage us from attempting to raise forces by the same means  it was then readily enacted , and executed without opposition , and without complaints  nor do I believe that any measures can be proposed of equal efficacy , and less severity .


Mr. SANDYS replied , in substance as follows : -- Sir , whether the precedents produced in defence of this bill , will have more weight than the arguments , must be shown by a careful examination , which will perhaps discover that the order sent to the magistrates of Bristol conveyed no new power , nor such as is , in any respect , parallel to that which this bill is intended to confer .


They were only enjoined to inquire with more than usual strictness , after strollers and vagabonds , such as the law has always subjected to punishment , and send them to the fleet , instead of any other place of correction  a method which may now be pursued without danger , opposition , or complaint .


But for my part , I am not able , upon the closest attention to the present scene of affairs , to find out the necessity of extraordinary methods of any kind .
The fears of an invasion from France , are , in my opinion , sir , merely chimerical  from their fleet in America the coasts of Britain have nothing to fear , and after the numerous levies of seamen by which it was fitted out , it is not yet probable that they can speedily send out another .
We know , sir , that the number of seamen depends upon the extent of commerce , and surely there is as yet no such disproportion between their trade and ours , as that they should be able to furnish out a naval armament with much greater expedition than ourselves .


In America our forces are at least equal to theirs , so that it is not very probable , that after the total destruction of our fleet by them , they should be so little injured , as to be able immediately to set sail for the channel , and insult us in our own ports  to effect this , sir , they must not only conquer us , but conquer us without resistance .


If they do not interrupt us in our attempts , nor expose themselves to an engagement , they may , indeed , return without suffering great damages , but I know not how they can leave the shores of America unobserved , or pour an unexpected invasion upon us .
If they continue there , sir , they can not hurt as , and when they return , we may prepare for their reception .


There are men , I know , sir , who have reason to think highly of the French policy , and whose ideas may be exalted to a belief that they can perform impossibilities  but I have not yet prevailed upon myself to conceive that they can act invisibly , or that they can equip a fleet by sorcery , collect an army in a moment , and defy us on our own coast , without any perceptible preparations .


Then admiral WAGER spoke thus : -- The calamities produced by discord and contention , need not to be pointed out  but it may be proper to reflect upon the consequences of a house divided against itself , that we may endeavour to avoid them .


Unanimity is produced by nothing more powerfully than by impending danger , and , therefore , it may be useful to show those who seem at present in profound security , that the power of France is more formidable than they are willing to allow .


My age , sir , enables me to remember many transactions of the wars in the late reigns , to which many gentlemen are strangers , or of which they have only imperfect ideas from history and tradition .


In the second year of the reign of William , the French gained a victory over the united fleets of the maritime powers , which gave them , for the summer following , the dominion of the Channel , enabled them to shut up our merchants in their ports , and produced a total suspension of our commerce .


Those , sir , to whom the importance of trade is so well known , will easily apprehend the weight of this calamity , and will , I hope , reject no measures that have a manifest tendency to prevent it .


Our ships , sir , do not lie useless because there is any want of seamen in the nation , but because any service is preferred to that of the publick .


There are now , to my knowledge , in one town on the west coast , no fewer than twelve hundred sailors , of which surely a third part may be justly claimed by the publick interest  nor do I know why they who obstinately refuse to serve their country , should be treated with so much tenderness .
It is more reasonable that they should suffer by their refusal , than that the general happiness should be endangered .


Mr. SOUTHWELL spoke next , to the following purpose : -- Sir , when any authority shall be lodged in my hands , to be exercised for the publick benefit , I shall always endeavour to exert it with honesty and diligence  but will never be made the instrument of oppression , nor execute any commission of tyranny or injustice .


As , therefore , the power of searching is to be placed in the hands of justices of the peace , I think it necessary to declare , that I will never perform so hateful a part of the office , and that if this bill becomes a law , I will retire from the place to which my authority is limited , rather than contribute to the miseries of my fellow-subjects .


Mr. LITTLETON spoke as follows : -- Sir , all the arguments which have been offered in support of this bill , are reduced at last to one constant assertion of the necessity of passing it .


We have been told , sir , with great acuteness , that a war can not be carried on without men , and that ships are useless without sailors  and from thence it is inferred that the bill is necessary .


That forces are by some means necessary to be raised , the warmest opponents of the bill will not deny , but they can not , therefore , allow the inference , that the methods now proposed are necessary .


They are of opinion , sir , that cruel and oppressive measures can never be justified , till all others have been tried without effect  they think that the law , when it was formerly passed , was unjust , and are convinced , by observing that it never was revived , and that it was by experience discovered to be useless .


Necessity , absolute necessity , is a formidable sound , and may terrify the weak and timorous into silence and compliance  but it will be found , upon reflection , to be often nothing but an idle feint , to amuse and to delude us , and that what is represented as necessary to the publick , is only something convenient to men in power .


Necessity , sir , has , heretofore , been produced as a plea for that which could be no otherwise defended .
In the days of Charles the first , ship-money was declared to be legal , because it was necessary .
Such was the reasoning of the lawyers , and the determination of the judges  but the senate , a senate of patriots !
without fear , and without corruption , and influenced only by a sincere regard for the publick , were of a different opinion , and neither admitted the lawfulness nor necessity .


It will become us , on this occasion , to act with equal vigour , and convince our countrymen , that we proceed upon the same principles , and that the liberties of the people are our chief care .


I hope we shall unite in defeating any attempts that may impair the rights which every Briton boasts as his birthright , and reject a law which will be equally dreaded and detested with the inquisition of Spain .


Sir William YONGE spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , though many particular clauses of this bill have been disapproved and opposed , some with more , and some with less reason , yet the committee has hitherto agreed that a bill for this purpose is necessary in the present state of our affairs  upon this principle we have proceeded thus far , several gentlemen have proposed their opinions , contributed their observations , and laboured as in an affair universally admitted to be of high importance to the general prosperity .


But now , sir , when some of the difficulties are surmounted , some expedients luckily struck out , some objections removed , and the great design brought nearer to execution , we are on a sudden informed , that all our labour is superfluous , that we are amusing ourselves with useless consultations , providing against calamities that can never happen , and raising bulwarks without an enemy  that , therefore , the question before us is of no importance , and the bill ought , without farther examination , to be totally rejected .


I suppose , sir , I shall be readily believed , when I declare that I shall willingly admit any arguments that may evince our safety  but , in proportion as real freedom from danger is to be desired , a supine and indolent neglect of it is to be dreaded and avoided  and I can not but fear that our enemies are more formidable , and more malicious , than the gentlemen that oppose this bill have represented them .


This bill can only be opposed upon the supposition that it gives a sanction to severities , more rigorous than our present circumstances require  for nothing can be more fallacious or invidious than a comparison of this law with the demand of ship-money , a demand contrary to all law , and enforced by the manifest exertion of arbitrary power .


How has the conduct of his present majesty any resemblance with that of Charles the first ?
Is any money levied by order of the council ?
Are the determinations of the judges set in opposition to the decrees of the senate ?
Is any man injured in his property by an unlimited extension of the prerogative ?
or any tribunal established superiour to the laws of the nation ?


To draw parallels , sir , where there is no resemblance  and to accuse , by insinuations , where there is no shadow of a crime  to raise outcries when no injury is attempted  and to deny a real necessity because it was once pretended for a bad purpose  is surely not to advance the publick service , which can be promoted only by just reasonings , and calm reflections , not by sophistry and satire , by insinuations without ground , and by instances beside the purpose .


Mr. LITTLETON answered : -- Sir , true zeal for the service of the publick is never discovered by collusive subterfuges and malicious representations  a mind , attentive to the common good , would hardly , on an occasion like this , have been at leisure to pervert an harmless illustration , and extract disaffection from a casual remark .


It is , indeed , not impossible , sir , that I might express myself obscurely  and it may be , therefore , necessary to declare that I intended no disrespectful reflection on the conduct of his majesty  but must observe , at the same time , that obscure or inaccurate expressions ought always to be interpreted in the most inoffensive meaning , and that to be too sagacious in discovering concealed insinuations , is no great proof of superiour integrity .


Wisdom , sir , is seldom captious , and honesty seldom suspicious  a man capable of comprehending the whole extent of a question , disdains to divert his attention by trifling observations  and he that is above the practice of little arts , or the motions of petty malice , does not easily imagine them incident to another .


That in the question of ship-money necessity was pretended , can not be denied  and , therefore , all that I asserted , which was only that the nation had been once terrified without reason , by the formidable sound of necessity , is evident and uncontested .


When a fraud has once been practised , it is of use to remember it , that we may not twice be deceived by the same artifice  and , therefore , I mentioned the plea of necessity , that it may be inquired whether it is now more true than before .


That the senate , sir , and not the judges , is now applied to , is no proof of the validity of the arguments which have been produced  for in the days of ship-money , the consent of the senate had been asked , had there been any prospect of obtaining it  but the court had been convinced , by frequent experiments , of the inflexibility of the senate , and despaired of influencing them by prospects of advantage , or intimidating them by frowns or menaces .


May this and every future senate imitate their conduct , and , like them , distinguish between real and pretended necessity  and let not us be terrified , by idle clamours , into the establishment of a law at once useless and oppressive .


Sir William YONGE replied : -- Sir , that I did not intend to misrepresent the meaning of the honourable gentleman , I hope it is not necessary to declare  and that I have , in reality , been guilty of any misrepresentation , I am not yet convinced .
If he did not intend a parallel between ship-money and the present bill , to what purpose was his observation ?
and if he did intend it , was it not proper to show there was no resemblance , and that all which could be inferred from it was , therefore , fallacious and inconclusive ?


Nor do I only differ , sir , in opinion with the honourable gentleman with relation to his comparison of measures , which have nothing in common with each other  but will venture to declare , that he is not more accurate in his citations from history .
The king did not apply to the judges , because the senate would not have granted him the money that he demanded , but because his chief ambition was to govern the nation by the prerogative alone , and to free himself and his descendants from senatorial inquiries .


That this account , sir , is just , I am confident the histories of those times will discover  and , therefore , any invidious comparison between that senate and any other , is without foundation in reason or in truth .


Mr. BATHURST spoke as follows : -- Sir , that this law will easily admit , in the execution of it , such abuses as will overbalance the benefits , may readily be proved  and it will not be consistent with that regard to the publick , expected from us by those whom we represent , to enact a law which may probably become an instrument of oppression .


The servant by whom I am now attended , may be termed , according to the determination of the vindicators of this bill , a seafaring man , having been once in the West Indies  and he may , therefore , be forced from my service , and dragged into a ship , by the authority of a justice of the peace , perhaps of some abandoned prostitute , dignified with a commission only to influence elections , and awe those whom excises and riot-acts can not subdue .


I think it , sir , not improper to declare , that I would by force oppose the execution of a law like this  that I would bar my doors and defend them  that I would call my neighbours to my assistance  and treat those who should attempt to enter without my consent , as thieves , ruffians , and murderers .


Lord GAGE spoke to this effect : -- Sir , it is well known that by the laws of this nation , poverty is , in some degree , considered as a crime , and that the debtor has only this advantage over the felon , that he can not be pursued into his dwelling , nor be forced from the shelter of his own house .


I think it is universally agreed , that the condition of a man in debt is already sufficiently miserable , and that it would be more worthy of the legislative power to contrive alleviations of his hardships , than additions to them  and it seems , therefore , no inconsiderable objection to this bill , that , by conferring the power of entering houses by force , it may give the harpies of the law an opportunity of entering , in the tumult of an impress , and of dragging a debtor to a noisome prison , under pretence of forcing sailors into the service of the crown .


Mr. TRACEY then said : -- Sir , that some law for the ends proposed by the bill before us , is necessary , I do not see how we can doubt , after the declarations of the admirals , who are fully acquainted with the service for which provision is to be made  and of the ministry , whose knowledge of the present state of our own strength , and the designs of our enemies , is , doubtless , more exact than they can acquire who are not engaged in publick employments .


If , therefore , the measures now proposed are necessary , though they may not be agreeable to the present dispositions of the people , for whose preservation they are intended , I shall think it my duty to concur in them , that the publick service may not be retarded , nor the safety of a whole nation hazarded , by a scrupulous attention to minute objections .


Mr. CAMPBELL spoke as follows : -- Sir , I have often , amidst my elogies on British liberty , and my declarations of the excellence of our constitution , the impartiality of our government , and the efficacy of our laws , been reproached by foreigners with the practice of impresses , as a hardship which would raise a rebellion in absolute monarchies , and kindle those nations into madness , that have , for many ages , known no other law than the will of their princes .
A hardship which includes imprisonment and slavery , and to which , therefore , no aggravations ought to be added .


But if justice and reason , sir , are to be overborne by necessity  if necessity is to stop our ears against the complaints of the oppressed , and harden our hearts at the sight of their misery , let it , at least , not destroy our memories , nor deprive us of the advantages of experience .


Let us inquire , sir , what were the effects of this hateful authority when it was formerly consigned to the magistrates .
Were our fleets manned in an instant ?
were our harbours immediately crowded with sailors ?
did we surprise our enemies by our expedition , and make conquests before an invasion could be suspected ?
I have heard , sir , of no such consequences , nor of any advantages which deserved to be purchased by tyranny and oppression .
We have found that very few were procured by the magistrates , and the charge of seizing and conveying was very considerable  and , therefore , can not but conclude that illegal measures , which have been once tried without success , should , for a double reason , never be revived .


Sir John BARNARD spoke to this effect : -- Sir , it is not without regret that I rise so often on this occasion : for to dispute with those whose determinations are not influenced by reason , is a ridiculous task , a tiresome labour , without prospect of reward .


But , as an honourable gentleman has lately remarked , that by denying the necessity of the bill , instead of making objections to particular clauses , the whole design of finding expedients to supply the sea service is at once defeated  I think it necessary to remind him , that I have made many objections to this bill , and supported them by reasons which have not yet been answered .
But I shall now no longer confine my remarks to single errours , but observe that there is one general defect , by which the whole bill is made absurd and useless .


For the foundation of a law like this , sir , the description of a seaman ought to be accurately laid down , it ought to be declared what acts shall subject him to that denomination , and by what means , after having once enlisted himself in this unhappy class of men , he may withdraw into a more secure and happy state of life .


Is a man , who has once only lost sight of the shore , to be for ever hunted as a seaman ?
Is a man , who , by traffick , has enriched a family , to be forced from his possessions by the authority of an impress ?
Is a man , who has purchased an estate , and built a seat , to solicit the admiralty for a protection from the neighbouring constable ?
Such questions as these , sir , may be asked , which the bill before us will enable no man to answer .


If a bill for this purpose be truly necessary , let it , at least , be freed from such offensive absurdities  let it be drawn up in a form as different as is possible from that of the bill before us  and , at last , I am far from imagining that a law will be contrived not injurious to individuals , nor detrimental to the publick  not contrary to the first principles of our establishment , and not loaded with folly and absurdities .


Mr. VYNER then spoke : -- Sir , a definition of a seaman is so necessary in a bill for this purpose , that the omission of it will defeat all the methods that can be suggested .
How shall a law be executed , or a penalty inflicted , when the magistrate has no certain marks whereby he may distinguish a criminal ?
and when even the man that is prosecuted may not be conscious of guilt , or know that the law extended to him , which he is charged with having offended .


If , in defining a seaman on the present occasion , it be thought proper to have any regard to the example of our predecessors , whose wisdom has , in this debate , been so much magnified  it may be observed , that a seaman has been formerly defined , a man who haunts the seas  a definition which seems to imply habit and continuance , and not to comprehend a man who has , perhaps , never gone more than a single voyage .


But though this definition , sir , should be added to the amendments already proposed , and the bill thereby be brought somewhat nearer to the constitutional principles of our government  I can not yet think it so much rectified , as that the hardships will not outweigh the benefits , and , therefore , shall continue to oppose the bill , though to some particular clauses I have no objection .


[ The term seafaring man was left out , and the several amendments were admitted in the committee , but the clauses themselves , to the number of eleven , were given up on the report . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 10 , 1740-1 .


The commons resolved their house into a committee , to consider the bill for the encouragement of sailors , when admiral WAGER offered a clause , by which it was to be enacted , `` That no merchants , or bodies corporate or politick , shall hire sailors at higher wages than thirty-five shillings for the month , on pain of forfeiting the treble value of the sum so agreed for  '' which law was to commence after fifteen days , and continue for a time to be agreed on by the house : and then spoke to the following purpose : --


Sir , the necessity of this clause must be so apparent to every gentleman acquainted with naval and commercial affairs , that as no opposition can be apprehended , very few arguments will be requisite to introduce it .


How much the publick calamities of war are improved by the sailors to their own private advantage  how generally they shun the publick service , in hopes of receiving exorbitant wages from the merchants  and how much they extort from the merchants , by threatening to leave their service for that of the crown , is universally known to every officer of the navy , and every commander of a trading vessel .


A law , therefore , sir , to restrain them in time of war from such exorbitant demands  to deprive them of those prospects which have often no other effect than to lull them in idleness , while they skulk about in expectation of higher wages  and to hinder them from deceiving themselves , embarrassing the merchants , and neglecting the general interest of their country , is undoubtedly just .
It is just , sir , because in regard to the publick it is necessary to prevent the greatest calamity that can fall upon a people , to preserve us from receiving laws from the most implacable of our enemies  and it is just , because with respect to particular men it has no tendency but to suppress idleness , fraud , and extortion .


Mr. Henby FOX spoke next : -- Sir , I have no objection to any part of this clause , except the day proposed for the commencement : to make a law against any pernicious practice , to which there are strong temptations , and to give those whose interest may incite them to it , time to effect their schemes , before the law shall begin to operate , seems not very consistent with wisdom or vigilance .


It is not denied , sir , that the merchants are betrayed by that regard to private interest which prevails too frequently over nobler views , to bribe away from the service of the crown , by large rewards , those sailors whose assistance is now so necessary to the publick  and , therefore , it is not to be imagined that they will not employ their utmost diligence to improve the interval which the bill allows in making contracts for the ensuing , year , and that the sailors will not eagerly engage themselves before this law shall preclude their prospects of advantage .


As , therefore , to make no law , and to make a law that will not be observed , is in consequence the same  and the time allowed by the clause , as it now stands , may make the whole provision ineffectual  it is my opinion , that either it ought to begin to operate to-morrow , or that we ought to leave the whole affair in its present state .


Then sir Robert WALPOLE spoke as follows : -- Sir , nothing has a greater appearance of injustice , than to punish men by virtue of laws , with which they were not acquainted  the law , therefore , is always supposed to be known by those who have offended it , because it is the duty of every man to know it  and certainly it ought to be the care of the legislature , that those whom a law will affect , may have a possibility of knowing it , and that those may not be punished for failing in their duty , whom nothing but inevitable ignorance has betrayed into offence .


But if the operation of this law should commence to-morrow , what numbers may break it , and suffer by the breach of it involuntarily , and without design  and how shall we vindicate ourselves from having been accessory to the crime which we censure and punish ?


Mr. FOX replied : -- Sir , I shall not urge in defence of my motion what is generally known , and has been frequently inculcated in all debates upon this bill , that private considerations ought always to give way to the necessities of the publick  for I think it sufficient to observe , that there is a distinction to be made between punishments and restraints , and that we never can be too early in the prevention of pernicious practices , though we may sometimes delay to punish them .


The law will be known to-morrow , to far the greatest number of those who may be tempted to defeat it  and if there be others that break it ignorantly , how will they find themselves injured by being only obliged to pay less than they promised , which is all that I should propose without longer warning .
The debate upon this particular , will be at length reduced to a question , whether a law for this purpose is just and expedient ?
If a law be necessary , it is necessary that it should be executed  and it can be executed only by commencing to-morrow .


Lord BALTIMORE spoke thus : -- Sir , it appears to me of no great importance how soon the operation of the law commences , or how long it is delayed , because I see no reason for imagining that it will at any time produce the effects proposed by it .


It has been the amusement , sir , of a great part of my life , to converse with men whose inclinations or employments have made them well acquainted with maritime affairs , and amidst innumerable other schemes for the promotion of trade , have heard some for the regulation of wages in trading ships  schemes , at the first appearance plausible and likely to succeed , but , upon a nearer inquiry , evidently entangled with insuperable difficulties , and never to be executed without danger of injuring the commerce of the nation .


The clause , sir , now before us contains , in my opinion , one of those visionary provisions , which , however infallible they may appear , will be easily defeated , and will have no other effect than to promote cunning and fraud , and to teach men those acts of collusion , with which they would otherwise never have been acquainted .


Mr. LODWICK spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I agree with the honourable gentleman by whom this clause has been offered , that the end for which it is proposed , is worthy of the closest attention of the legislative power , and that the evils of which the prevention is now endeavoured , may in some measure not only obstruct our traffick , but endanger our country  and shall therefore very readily concur in any measures for this purpose , that shall not appear either unjust or ineffectual .


Whether this clause will be sufficient to restrain all elusive contracts , and whether all the little artifices of interest are sufficiently obviated , I am yet unable to determine  but by a reflection upon the multiplicity of relations to be considered , and the variety of circumstances to be adjusted in a provision of this kind , I am inclined to think that , it is not the business of a transient inquiry , or of a single clause , but that it will demand a separate law , and engage the deliberation and regard of this whole assembly .


Sir John BARNARD said : -- Sir , notwithstanding the impatience and resentment with which some men see their mistakes and ignorance detected  notwithstanding the reverence which negligence and haste are said to be entitled to from this assembly , I shall declare once more , without the apprehension of being confuted , that this bill was drawn up without consideration , and is defended without being understood  that after all the amendments which have been admitted , and all the additions proposed , it will be oppressive and ineffectual , a chaos of absurdities , and a monument of ignorance .


Sir Robert WALPOLE replied : -- Sir , the present business of this assembly is to examine the clause before us  but to deviate from so necessary an inquiry into loud exclamations against the whole bill , is to obstruct the course of the debate , to perplex our attention , and interrupt the senate in its deliberation upon questions , in the determination of which the security of the publick is nearly concerned .


The war , sir , in which we are now engaged , and , I may add , engaged by the general request of the whole nation , can be prosecuted only by the assistance of the seamen , from whom it is not to be expected that they will sacrifice their immediate advantage to the security of their country .
Publick spirit , where it is to be found , is the result of reflection , refined by study and exalted by education , and is not to be hoped for among those whom low fortune has condemned to perpetual drudgery .
It must be , therefore , necessary to supply the defects of education , and to produce , by salutary coercions , those effects which it is vain to expect from other causes .


That the service of the sailors will be set up to sale by auction , and that the merchants will bid against the government , is incontestable  nor is there any doubt that they will be able to offer the highest price , because they will take care to repay themselves by raising the value of their goods .
Thus , without some restraint upon the merchants , our enemies , who are not debarred by their form of government from any method which policy can invent , or absolute power put in execution , will preclude all our designs , and set at defiance a nation superiour to themselves .


Sir John BARNARD then said : -- Sir , I think myself obliged by my duty to my country , and by my gratitude to those by whose industry we are enriched , and by whose courage we are defended , to make , once more , a declaration , not against particular clauses , not against single circumstances , but against the whole bill  a bill unjust and oppressive , absurd and ridiculous  a bill to harass the industrious and distress the honest , to puzzle the wise and add power to the cruel  a bill which can not be read without astonishment , nor passed without the violation of our constitution , and an equal disregard of policy and humanity .


All these assertions will need to be proved only by a bare perusal of this hateful bill , by which the meanest , the most worthless reptile , exalted to a petty office by serving a wretch only superiour to him in fortune , is enabled to flush his authority by tyrannising over those who every hour deserve the publick acknowledgments of the community  to intrude upon the retreats of brave men , fatigued and exhausted by honest industry , to drag them out with all the wantonness of grovelling authority , and chain them to the oar without a moment 's respite , or perhaps oblige them to purchase , with the gains of a dangerous voyage , or the plunder of an enemy lately conquered , a short interval to settle their affairs , or bid their children farewell .


Let any gentleman in this house , let those , sir , who now sit at ease , projecting laws of oppression , and conferring upon their own slaves such licentious authority , pause a few moments , and imagine themselves exposed to the same hardships by a power superiour to their own  let them conceive themselves torn from the tenderness and caresses of their families by midnight irruptions , dragged in triumph through the streets by a despicable officer , and placed under the command of those by whom they have , perhaps , been already oppressed and insulted .
Why should we imagine that the race of men for whom those cruelties are preparing , have less sensibility than ourselves ?
Why should we believe that they will suffer without complaint , and be injured without resentment ?
Why should we conceive that they will not at once deliver themselves , and punish their oppressors , by deserting that country where they are considered as felons , and laying hold on those rewards and privileges which no other government will deny them ?


This is , indeed , the only tendency , whatever may have been the intention of the bill before us  for I know not whether the most refined sagacity can discover any other method of discouraging navigation than those which are drawn together in the bill before us .
We first give our constables an authority to hunt the sailors like thieves , and drive them , by incessant pursuit , out of the nation  but lest any man should by friendship , good fortune , or the power of money , find means of staying behind , we have with equal wisdom condemned him to poverty and misery  and lest the natural courage of his profession should incite him to assist his country in the war , have contrived a method of precluding him from any advantage that he might have the weakness to hope from his fortitude and diligence .
What more can be done , unless we at once prohibit to seamen the use of the common elements , or doom them to a general proscription .


It is just that advantage , sir , should be proportioned to the hazard by which it is to be obtained , and , therefore , a sailor has an honest claim to an advance of wages in time of war  it is necessary to excite expectation , and to fire ambition by the prospect of great acquisitions , and by this prospect it is that such numbers are daily allured to naval business , and that our privateers are filled with adventurers .
The large wages which war makes necessary , are more powerful incentives to those whom impatience of poverty determines to change their state of life , than the secure gains of peaceful commerce  for the danger is overlooked by a mind intent upon the profit .


War is the harvest of a sailor , in which he is to store provisions for the winter of old age , and if we blast this hope , he will inevitably sink into indolence and cowardice .


Many of the sailors are bred up to trades , or capable of any laborious employment upon land  nor is there any reason for which they expose themselves to the dangers of a seafaring life , but the hope of sudden wealth , and some lucky season in which they may improve their fortunes by a single effort .
Is it reasonable to believe that all these will not rather have recourse to their former callings , and live in security , though not in plenty , than encounter danger and poverty at once , and face an enemy without any prospect of recompense ?


Let any man recollect the ideas that arose in his mind upon hearing of a bill for encouraging and increasing sailors , and examine whether he had any expectation of expedients like these .
I suppose it was never known before , that men were to be encouraged by subjecting them to peculiar penalties , or that to take away the gains of a profession , was a method of recommending it more generally to the people .


But it is not of very great importance to dwell longer upon the impropriety of this clause , which there is no possibility of putting in execution .
That the merchants will try every method of eluding a law so prejudicial to their interest , may be easily imagined , and a mind not very fruitful of evasions , will discover that this law may be eluded by a thousand artifices .
If the merchants are restrained from allowing men their wages beyond a certain sum , they will make contracts for the voyage , of which the time may very easily be computed , they may offer a reward for expedition and fidelity , they may pay a large sum by way of advance , they may allow the sailors part of the profits , or may offer money by a third hand .
To fix the price of any commodity , of which the quantity and the use may vary their proportions , is the most excessive degree of ignorance .
No man can determine the price of corn , unless he can regulate the harvest , and keep the number of the people for ever at a stand .


But let us suppose these methods as efficacious as their most sanguine vindicators are desirous of representing them , it does not yet appear that they are necessary , and to inflict hardships without necessity , is by no means the practice of either wisdom or benevolence .
To tyrannise and compel is the low pleasure of petty capacities , of narrow minds , swelled with the pride of uncontroulable authority , the wantonness of wretches who are insensible of the consequences of their own actions , and of whom candour may , perhaps , determine , that they are only cruel because they are stupid .
Let us not exalt into a precedent the most unjust and rigorous law of our predecessors , of which they themselves declared their repentance , or confessed the inefficacy , by never reviving it  let us rather endeavour to gain the sailors by lenity and moderation , and reconcile them to the service of the crown by real encouragements  for it is rational to imagine , that in proportion as men are disgusted by injuries , they will be won by kindness .


There is one expedient , sir , which deserves to be tried , and from which , at least , more success may be hoped than from cruelty , hunger , and persecution .
The ships that are now to be fitted out for service , are those of the first magnitude , which it is usual to bring back into the ports in winter .
Let us , therefore , promise to all seamen that shall voluntarily engage in them , besides the reward already proposed , a discharge from the service at the end of six or seven months .
By this they will be released from their present dread of perpetual slavery , and be certain , as they are when in the service of the merchants , of a respite from their fatigues .
The trade of the nation will be only interrupted for a time , and may be carried on in the winter months , and large sums will be saved by dismissing the seamen when they can not be employed .


By adding this to the other methods of encouragement , and throwing aside all rigorous and oppressive schemes , the navy may easily be manned , our country protected , our commerce reestablished , and our enemies subdued  but to pass the bill as it now stands , is to determine that trade shall cease , and that no ship shall sail out of the river .


Mr. PITT spoke to the following purport : -- Sir , it is common for those to have the greatest regard to their own interest who discover the least for that of others .
I do not , therefore , despair of recalling the advocates of this bill from the prosecution of their favourite measures , by arguments of greater efficacy than those which are founded on reason and justice .


Nothing , sir , is more evident , than that some degree of reputation is absolutely necessary to men who have any concern in the administration of a government like ours  they must either secure the fidelity of their adherents by the assistance of wisdom , or of virtue  their enemies must either be awed by their honesty , or terrified by their cunning .
Mere artless bribery will never gain a sufficient majority to set them entirely free from apprehensions of censure .
To different tempers different motives must be applied : some , who place their felicity in being accounted wise , are in very little care to preserve the character of honesty  others may be persuaded to join in measures which they easily discover to be weak and ill-concerted , because they are convinced that the authors of them are not corrupt but mistaken , and are unwilling that any man should be punished for natural defects or casual ignorance .


I can not say , sir , which of these motives influences the advocates for the bill before us  a bill in which such cruelties are proposed as are yet unknown among the most savage nations , such as slavery has not yet borne , or tyranny invented , such as can not be heard without resentment , nor thought of without horrour .


It is , sir , perhaps , not unfortunate , that one more expedient has been added , rather ridiculous than shocking , and that these tyrants of the administration , who amuse themselves with oppressing their fellow-subjects , who add without reluctance one hardship to another , invade the liberty of those whom they have already overborne with taxes , first plunder and then imprison , who take all opportunities of heightening the publick distresses , and make the miseries of war the instruments of new oppressions , are too ignorant to be formidable , and owe their power not to their abilities , but to casual prosperity , or to the influence of money .


The other clauses of this bill , complicated at once with cruelty and folly , have been treated with becoming indignation  but this may be considered with less ardour of resentment , and fewer emotions of zeal , because , though , perhaps , equally iniquitous , it will do no harm  for a law that can never be executed can never be felt .


That it will consume the manufacture of paper , and swell the books of statutes , is all the good or hurt that can be hoped or feared from a law like this  a law which fixes what is in its own nature mutable , which prescribes rules to the seasons and limits to the wind .
I am too well acquainted , sir , with the disposition of its two chief supporters , to mention the contempt with which this law will be treated by posterity , for they have already shown abundantly their disregard of succeeding generations  but I will remind them , that they are now venturing their whole interest at once , and hope they will recollect , before it is too late , that those who believe them to intend the happiness of their country , will never be confirmed in their opinion by open cruelty and notorious oppression  and that those who have only their own interest in view , will be afraid of adhering to those leaders , however old and practised in expedients , however strengthened by corruption , or elated with power , who have no reason to hope for success from either their virtue or abilities .


Mr. BATHURST next spoke to this effect : -- Sir , the clause now under our consideration is so inconsiderately drawn up , that it is impossible to read it in the most cursory manner , without discovering the necessity of numerous amendments  no malicious subtilties or artful deductions are required in raising objections to this part of the bill , they crowd upon us without being sought , and , instead of exercising our sagacity , weary our attention .


The first errour , or rather one part of a general and complicated errour , is the computation of time , not by days , but by calendar months , which , as they are not equal one to another , may embarrass the account between the sailors and those that employ them .
In all contracts of a short duration , the time is to be reckoned by weeks and days , by certain and regular periods , which has been so constantly the practice of the seafaring men , that , perhaps , many of them do not know the meaning of a calendar month : this , indeed , is a neglect of no great importance , because no man can be deprived by it of more than the wages due for the labour of a few days  but the other part of this clause is more seriously to be considered , as it threatens the sailors with greater injuries : for it is to be enacted , that all contracts made for more wages than are here allowed shall be totally void .


It can not be denied to be possible , and in my opinion it is very likely , that many contracts will be made without the knowledge of this law , and consequently without any design of violating it  but ignorance , inevitable ignorance , though it is a valid excuse for every other man , is no plea for the unhappy sailor  he must suffer , though innocent , the penalty of a crime  must undergo danger , hardships , and labour , without a recompense , and at the end of a successful voyage , after having enriched his country by his industry , return home to a necessitous family , without being able to relieve them .


It is scarcely necessary , sir , to raise any more objections to a clause in which nothing is right  but , to show how its imperfections multiply upon the slightest consideration , I take the opportunity to observe , that there is no provision made for regulating the voyages performed in less time than a month , so that the greatest part of the abuses , which have been represented as the occasion of this clause , are yet without remedy , and only those sailors who venture far , and are exposed to the greatest dangers , are restrained from receiving an adequate reward .


Thus much , sir , I have said upon the supposition that a regulation of the sailors ' wages is either necessary or just  a supposition of which I am very far from discovering the truth .
That it is just to oppress the most useful of our fellow-subjects , to load those men with peculiar hardships to whom we owe the plenty that we enjoy , the power that yet remains in the nation , and which neither the folly nor the cowardice of ministers have yet been able to destroy , and the security in which we now sit and hold our consultations  that it is just to lessen our payments at a time when we increase the labour of those who are hired , and to expose men to danger without recompense , will not easily be proved , even by those who are most accustomed to paradoxes , and are ready to undertake the proof of any position which it is their interest to find true .


Nor is it much more easy to show the necessity of this expedient in our present state , in which it appears from the title of the bill , that our chief endeavour should be the increase and encouragement of sailors , and , I suppose , it has not often been discovered , that by taking away the profits of a profession greater numbers have been allured to it .


The high wages , sir , paid by merchants are the chief incitements that prevail upon the ambitious , the necessitous , or the avaricious , to forsake the ease and security of the land , to leave easy trades , and healthful employments , and expose themselves to an element where they are not certain of an hour 's safety .
The service of the merchants is the nursery in which seamen are trained up for his majesty 's navies , and from thence we must , in time of danger , expect those forces by which alone we can be protected .


If , therefore , it is necessary to encourage sailors , it is necessary to reject all measures that may terrify or disgust them  and as their numbers must depend upon our trade , let us not embarrass the merchants with any other difficulties than those which are inseparable from war , and which very little care has been hitherto taken to alleviate .


Mr. HAY replied : -- Sir , the objections which have been urged with so much ardour , and displayed with such power of eloquence , are not , in my opinion , formidable enough to discourage us from prosecuting our measures  some of them may be , perhaps , readily answered , and the rest easily removed .


The computation of time , as it now stands , is allowed not to produce any formidable evil , and therefore did not require so rhetorical a censure : the inconveniency of calendar months may easily be removed by a little candour in the contracting parties , or , that the objection may not be repeated to the interruption of the debate , weeks or days may be substituted , and the usual reckoning of the sailors be still continued .


That some contracts may be annulled , and inconveniencies or delays of payment arise , is too evident to be questioned  but in that case the sailor may have his remedy provided , and be enabled to obtain , by an easy process , what he shall be judged to have deserved  for it must be allowed reasonable , that every man who labours in honest and useful employments , should receive the reward of his diligence and fidelity .


Thus , sir , may the clause , however loudly censured and violently opposed , be made useful and equitable , and the publick service advanced without injury to individuals .


Sir Robert WALPOLE next rose , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , every law which extends its influence to great numbers in various relations and circumstances , must produce some consequences that were never foreseen or intended , and is to be censured or applauded as the general advantages or inconveniencies are found to preponderate .
Of this kind is the law before us , a law enforced by the necessity of our affairs , and drawn up with no other intention than to secure the publick happiness , and produce that success which every man 's interest must prompt him to desire .


If in the execution of this law , sir , some inconveniencies should arise , they are to be remedied as fast as they are discovered , or if not capable of a remedy , to be patiently borne , in consideration of the general advantage .


That some temporary disturbances may be produced is not improbable  the discontent of the sailors may , for a short time , rise high , and our trade be suspended by their obstinacy  but obstinacy , however determined , must yield to hunger , and when no higher wages can be obtained , they will cheerfully accept of those which are here allowed them .
Short voyages , indeed , are not comprehended in the clause , and therefore the sailors will engage in them upon their own terms , but this objection can be of no weight with those that oppose the clause , because , if it is unjust to limit the wages of the sailors , it is just to leave those voyages without restriction  and those that think the expedient here proposed equitable and rational , may , perhaps , be willing to make some concessions to those who are of a different opinion .


That the bill will not remove every obstacle to success , nor add weight to one part of the balance without making the other lighter  that it will not supply the navy without incommoding the merchants in some degree  that it may be sometimes evaded by cunning , and sometimes abused by malice  and that at last it will be less efficacious than is desired , may , perhaps , be proved  but it has not yet been proved that any other measures are more eligible , or that we are not to promote the publick service as far as we are able , though our endeavours may not produce effects equal to our wishes .


Sir John BARNARD then spoke , to this effect : -- Sir , I know not by what fatality it is that nothing can be urged in defence of the clause before us which does not tend to discover its weakness and inefficacy .
The warmest patrons of this expedient are impelled , by the mere force of conviction , to such concessions as invalidate all their arguments , and leave their opponents no necessity of replying .


If short voyages are not comprehended in this provision , what are we now controverting ?
What but the expedience of a law that will never be executed ?
The sailors , however they are contemned by those who think them only worthy to be treated like beasts of burden , are not yet so stupid but that they can easily find out , that to serve a fortnight for greater wages is more eligible than to toil a month for less  and as the numerous equipments that have been lately made have not left many more sailors in the service of the merchants than may be employed in the coasting trade , those who traffick to remoter parts , must shut up their books and wait till the expiration of this act , for an opportunity of renewing their commerce .


To regulate the wages for one voyage , and to leave another without limitation , in time of scarcity of seamen , is absolutely to prohibit that trade which is so restrained , and is , doubtless , a more effectual embargo than has been yet invented .


Let any man but suppose that the East India company were obliged to give only half the wages that other traders allow , and consider how that part of our commerce could be carried on  would not their goods rot in their warehouses , and their ships lie for ever in the harbour ?
Would not the sailors refuse to contract with them ?
or desert them after a contract , upon the first prospect of more advantageous employment ?


But it is not requisite to multiply arguments in a question which may not only be decided without long examination , but in which we may determine our conclusions by the experience of our ancestors .
Scarcely any right or wrong measures are without a precedent , and , amongst others , this expedient has been tried by the wisdom of former times  a law was once made for limiting the wages of tailors , and that it is totally ineffectual we are all convinced .
Experience is a very safe guide in political inquiries , and often discovers what the most enlightened reason failed to foresee .


Let us , therefore , improve the errours of our ancestors to our own advantage , and whilst we neglect to imitate their virtues , let us , at least , forbear to repeat their follies .


Mr. PERRY spoke to this purpose : -- Sir , there is one objection more which my acquaintance with foreign trade impresses too strongly upon my mind to suffer me to conceal it .


It is well known that the condition of a seaman subjects him to the necessity of spending a great part of his life at a distance from his native country , in places where he can neither hear of our designs , nor be instructed in our laws , and , therefore , it is evident that no law ought to affect him before a certain period of time , in which he may reasonably be supposed to have been informed of it .
For every man ought to have it in his power to avoid punishment , and to suffer only for negligence or obstinacy .


It is quite unnecessary , sir , to observe to this assembly , that there are now , as at all times , great numbers of sailors in every part of the world , and that they , at least , equally deserve our regard with those who are under the more immediate influence of the government .


These seamen have already contracted for the price of their labour , and the recompense of their hazards , nor can we , in my opinion , without manifest injustice , dissolve a contract founded upon equity , and confirmed by law .


It is , sir , an undisputed principle of government , that no person should be punished without a crime  but is it no punishment to deprive a man of what is due to him by a legal stipulation , the condition of which is , on his part , honestly fulfilled ?


Nothing , sir , can be imagined more calamitous than the disappointment to which this law subjects the unhappy men who are now promoting the interest of their country in distant places , amidst dangers and hardships , in unhealthy climates , and barbarous nations , where they comfort themselves , under the fatigues of labour and the miseries of sickness , with the prospect of the sum which they shall gain for the relief of their families , and the respite which their wages will enable them to enjoy  but , upon their return , they find their hopes blasted , and their contracts dissolved by a law made in their absence .


No human being , I think , can coolly and deliberately inflict a hardship like this , and , therefore , I doubt not but those who have , by inadvertency , given room for this objection , will either remove it by an amendment , or what is , in my opinion , more eligible , reject the clause as inexpedient , useless , and unjust .


Sir William YONGE spoke next to this effect : -- Sir , this debate has been protracted , not by any difficulties arising from the nature of the questions which have been the subject of it , but by a neglect with which almost all the opponents of the bill may be justly charged , the neglect of distinguishing between measures eligible in themselves , and measures preferable to consequences which are apprehended from particular conjunctures  between laws made only to advance the publick happiness , and expedients of which the benefit is merely occasional , and of which the sole intention is to avert some national calamity , and which are to cease with the necessity that produced them .


Such are the measures , sir , which are now intended  measures , which , in days of ease , security , and prosperity , it would be the highest degree of weakness to propose , but of which I can not see the absurdity in times of danger and distress .
Such laws are the medicines of a state , useless and nauseous in health , but preferable to a lingering disease , or to a miserable death .


Even those measures , sir , which have been mentioned as most grossly absurd , and represented as parallel to the provision made in this clause only to expose it to contempt and ridicule , may , in particular circumstances , be rational and just .
To settle the price of corn in the time of a famine , may become the wisest state , and multitudes might , in time of publick misery , by the benefit of temporary laws , be preserved from destruction .
Even those masts , to which , with a prosperous gale , the ship owes its usefulness and its speed , are often cut down by the sailors in the fury of a storm .


With regard to the ships which are now in distant places , whither no knowledge of this law can possibly be conveyed , it can not be denied that their crews ought to be secured from injury by some particular exception  for though it is evident in competitions between publick and private interest , which ought to be preferred , yet we ought to remember that no unnecessary injury is to be done to individuals , even while we are providing for the safety of the nation .


Mr. FAZAKERLY spoke to this effect : -- Sir , though I can not be supposed to have much acquaintance with naval affairs , and , therefore , may not , perhaps , discover the full force of the arguments that have been urged in favour of the clause now under consideration , yet I can not but think myself under an indispensable obligation to examine it as far as I am able , and to make use of the knowledge which I have acquired , however inferiour to that of others .


The argument , sir , the only real argument , which has been produced in favour of the restraint of wages now proposed , appears to me by no means conclusive  nor can I believe that the meanest and most ignorant seaman would , if it were proposed to him , hesitate a moment for an answer to it .
Let me suppose , sir , a merchant urging it as a charge against a seaman , that he raises his demand of wages in time of war , would not the sailor readily reply , that harder labour required larger pay ?
Would he not ask , why the general practice of mankind is charged as a crime upon him only ?
Inquire , says he , of the workmen in the docks , have they not double wages for double labour ?
and is not their lot safe and easy in comparison with mine , who at once encounter danger and support fatigue , carry on war and commerce at the same time , conduct the ship and oppose the enemy , and am equally exposed to captivity and shipwreck ?


That this is , in reality , the state of a sailor in time of war , I think , sir , too evident to require proof  nor do I see what reply can be made to the sailor 's artless expostulation .


I know not why the sailors alone should serve their country to their disadvantage , and be expected to encounter danger without the incitement of a reward .


Nor will any part of the hardships of this clause be alleviated by the expedient suggested by an honourable member , who spoke , some time ago , of granting , or allowing , to a sailor , whose contract shall be void , what our courts of law should adjudge him to deserve , a quantum meruit : for , according to the general interpretation of our statutes , it will be determined that he has forfeited his whole claim by illegal contract .
To instance , sir , the statute of usury .
He that stipulates for higher interest than is allowed , is not able to recover his legal demand , but irrecoverably forfeits the whole .


Thus , sir , an unhappy sailor who shall innocently transgress this law , must lose all the profit of his voyage , and have nothing to relieve him after his fatigues  but when he has by his courage repelled the enemy , and , by his skill , escaped storms and rocks , must suffer yet severer hardships , in being subject to a forfeiture where he expected applause , comfort , and recompense .


The ATTORNEY GENERAL spoke next , to this purport : -- Sir , the clause before us can not , in my opinion , produce any such dreadful consequences as the learned gentleman appears to imagine : however , to remove all difficulties , I have drawn up an amendment , which I shall beg leave to propose , that the contracts which may be affected as the clause now stands , shall be void only as to so much of the wages as shall exceed the sum to which the house shall agree to reduce the seamen 's pay  and , as to the forfeitures , they are not to be levied upon the sailors , but upon the merchants , or trading companies , who employ them , and who are able to pay greater sums without being involved in poverty and distress .


With regard , sir , to the reasons for introducing this clause , they are , in my judgment , valid and equitable .
We have found it necessary to fix the rate of money at interest , and the rate of labour in several cases , and if we do not in this case , what will be the consequence ?
-- a second embargo on commerce , and , perhaps , a total stop to all military preparations .
Is it reasonable that any man should rate his labour according to the immediate necessities of those that employ him ?
or that he should raise his own fortune by the publick calamities ?
If this has hitherto been a practice , it is a practice contrary to the general happiness of society , and ought to prevail no longer .


If the sailor , sir , is exposed to greater dangers in time of war , is not the merchant 's trade carried on , likewise , at greater hazard ?
Is not the freight , equally with the sailors , threatened at once by the ocean and the enemy ?
And is not the owner 's fortune equally impaired , whether the ship is dashed upon a rock , or seized by a privateer ?


The merchant , therefore , has as much reason for paying less wages in time of war , as the sailor for demanding more , and nothing remains but that the legislative power determine a medium between their different interests , with justice , if possible , at least with impartiality .


Mr. Horace WALPOLE , who had stood up several times , but was prevented by other members , spoke next , to this purport : -- Sir , I was unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate while it was carried on with calmness and decency , by men , who do not suffer the ardour of opposition to cloud their reason , or transport them to such expressions as the dignity of this assembly does not admit .
I have hitherto deferred to answer the gentleman who declaimed against the bill with such fluency of rhetorick , and such vehemence of gesture  who charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed , with having no regard to any interest but their own , and with making laws only to consume paper , and threatened them with the defection of their adherence , and the loss of their influence , upon this new discovery of their folly and their ignorance .


Nor , sir , do I now answer him for any other purpose than to remind him how little the clamours of rage and petulancy of invectives contribute to the purposes for which this assembly is called together  how little the discovery of truth is promoted , and the security of the nation established by pompous diction and theatrical emotions .


Formidable sounds , and furious declamations , confident assertions , and lofty periods , may affect the young and unexperienced  and , perhaps , the gentleman may have contracted his habits of oratory by conversing more with those of his own age , than with such as have had more opportunities of acquiring knowledge , and more successful methods of communicating their sentiments .


If the heat of his temper , sir , would suffer him to attend to those whose age and long acquaintance with business give them an indisputable right to deference and superiority , he would learn , in time , to reason rather than declaim , and to prefer justness of argument , and an accurate knowledge of facts , to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives , which may disturb the imagination for a moment , but leave no lasting impression on the mind .


He will learn , sir , that to accuse and prove are very different , and that reproaches , unsupported by evidence , affect only the character of him that utters them .
Excursions of fancy , and flights of oratory , are , indeed , pardonable in young men , but in no other  and it would surely contribute more , even to the purpose for which some gentlemen appear to speak , that of depreciating the conduct of the administration , to prove the inconveniencies and injustice of this bill , than barely to assert them , with whatever magnificence of language , or appearance of zeal , honesty , or compassion .


Mr. PITT replied : -- Sir , the atrocious crime of being a young man , which the honourable gentleman has with such spirit and decency charged upon me , I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny , but content myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may cease with their youth , and not of that number , who are ignorant in spite of experience .


Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a reproach , I will not , sir , assume the province of determining  but surely age may become justly contemptible , if the opportunities which it brings have passed away without improvement , and vice appears to prevail when the passions have subsided .
The wretch that , after having seen the consequences of a thousand errours , continues still to blunder , and whose age has only added obstinacy to stupidity , is surely the object of either abhorrence or contempt , and deserves not that his grey head should secure him from insults .


Much more , sir , is he to be abhorred , who , as he has advanced in age , has receded from virtue , and becomes more wicked with less temptation  who prostitutes himself for money which he can not enjoy , and spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country .


But youth , sir , is not my only crime  I have been accused of acting a theatrical part -- a theatrical part may either imply some peculiarities of gesture , or a dissimulation of my real sentiments , and an adoption of the opinions and language of another man .


In the first sense , sir , the charge is too trifling to be confuted , and deserves only to be mentioned , that it may be despised .
I am at liberty , like every other man , to use my own language  and though I may , perhaps , have some ambition to please this gentleman , I shall not lay myself under any restraint , nor very solicitously copy his diction , or his mien , however matured by age , or modelled by experience .


If any man shall , by charging me with theatrical behaviour , imply that I utter any sentiments but my own , I shall treat him as a calumniator and a villain  nor shall any protection shelter him from the treatment which he deserves .
I shall , on such an occasion , without scruple , trample upon all those forms , with which wealth and dignity intrench themselves , nor shall any thing but age restrain my resentment : age , which always brings one privilege , that of being insolent and supercilious without punishment .


But , with regard , sir , to those whom I have offended , I am of opinion , that if I had acted a borrowed part , I should have avoided their censure  the heat that offended them is the ardour of conviction , and that zeal for the service of my country , which neither hope nor fear shall influence me to suppress .
I will not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded , nor look in silence upon publick robbery .
I will exert my endeavours , at whatever hazard , to repel the aggressor , and drag the thief to justice , whoever may protect them in their villany , and whoever may partake of their plunder .
And if the honourable gentleman --


Here Mr. WINNINGTON called to order , and Mr. PITT sitting down , he spoke thus : -- It is necessary , sir , that the order of this assembly be observed , and the debate resumed without personal altercations .
Such expressions as have been vented on this occasion , become not an assembly intrusted with the liberty and welfare of their country .
To interrupt the debate on a subject so important as that before us , is , in some measure , to obstruct the publick happiness , and violate our trust : but much more heinous is the crime of exposing our determinations to contempt , and inciting the people to suspicion or mutiny , by indecent reflections , or unjust insinuations .


I do not , sir , undertake to decide the controversy between the two gentlemen , but must be allowed to observe , that no diversity of opinion can justify the violation of decency , and the use of rude and virulent expressions  expressions dictated only by resentment , and uttered without regard to --


Mr. PITT called to order , and said : -- Sir , if this be to preserve order , there is no danger of indecency from the most licentious tongue : for what calumny can be more atrocious , or what reproach more severe , than that of speaking with regard to any thing but truth .
Order may sometimes be broken by passion , or inadvertency , but will hardly be reestablished by monitors like this , who can not govern his own passion , whilst he is restraining the impetuosity of others .


Happy , sir , would it be for mankind , if every one knew his own province  we should not then see the same man at once a criminal and a judge .
Nor would this gentleman assume the right of dictating to others what he has not learned himself .


That I may return , in some degree , the favour which he intends me , I will advise him never hereafter to exert himself on the subject of order  but , whenever he finds himself inclined to speak on such occasions , to remember how he has now succeeded , and condemn , in silence , what his censures will never reform .


Mr. WINNINGTON replied : -- Sir , as I was hindered by the gentleman 's ardour and impetuosity from concluding my sentence , none but myself can know the equity or partiality of my intentions , and , therefore , as I can not justly be condemned , I ought to be supposed innocent  nor ought he to censure a fault of which he can not be certain that it would ever have been committed .


He has , indeed , exalted himself to a degree of authority never yet assumed by any member of this house , that of condemning others to silence .
I am henceforward , by his inviolable decree , to sit and hear his harangues without daring to oppose him .
How wide he may extend his authority , or whom he will proceed to include in the same sentence , I shall not determine  having not yet arrived at the same degree of sagacity with himself , nor being able to foreknow what another is going to pronounce .


If I had given offence by any improper sallies of passion , I ought to have been censured by the concurrent voice of the assembly , or have received a reprimand , sir , from you , to which I should have submitted without opposition  but I will not be doomed to silence by one who has no pretensions to authority , and whose arbitrary decisions can only tend to introduce uproar , discord , and confusion .


Mr. Henry PELHAM next rose up , and spoke to this effect : -- Sir , when , in the ardour of controversy upon interesting questions , the zeal of the disputants hinders them from a nice observation of decency and regularity , there is some indulgence due to the common weakness of our nature  nor ought any gentleman to affix to a negligent expression a more offensive sense than is necessarily implied by it .


To search deep , sir , for calumnies and reproaches is no laudable nor beneficial curiosity  it must always be troublesome to ourselves by alarming us with imaginary injuries , and may often be unjust to others by charging them with invectives which they never intended .
General candour and mutual tenderness will best preserve our own quiet , and support that dignity which has always been accounted essential to national debates , and seldom infringed without dangerous consequences .


Mr. LYTTLETON spoke as follows : -- Sir , no man can be more zealous for decency than myself , or more convinced of the necessity of a methodical prosecution of the question before us .
I am well convinced how near indecency and faction are to one another , and how inevitably confusion produces obscurity  but I hope it will always be remembered , that he who first infringes decency , or deviates from method , is to answer for all the consequences that may arise from the neglect of senatorial customs : for it is not to be expected that any man will bear reproaches without reply , or that he who wanders from the question will not be followed in his digressions , and hunted through his labyrinths .


It can not , sir , be denied , that some insinuations were uttered injurious to those whose zeal may sometimes happen to prompt them to warm declarations , or incite them to passionate emotions .
Whether I am of importance enough to be included in the censure , I despise it too much to inquire or consider , but can not forbear to observe , that zeal for the right can never become reproachful , and that no man can fall into contempt but those who deserve it .


[ The clause was amended , and agreed to . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 13 , 1740-1 .


The seventieth day of the session being appointed for the report from the committee on the bill for the increase and encouragement of sailors , sir John BARNARD presented a petition from the merchants of London , and spoke as follows : --


Sir , this petition I am directed to lay before this house by many of the principal merchants of that great city which I have the honour to represent  men too wise to be terrified with imaginary dangers , and too honest to endeavour the obstruction of any measures that may probably advance the publick good , merely because they do not concur with their private interest  men , whose knowledge and capacity enable them to judge rightly , and whose acknowledged integrity and spirit set them above the suspicion of concealing their sentiments .


I therefore present this petition in the name of the merchants of London , in full confidence that it will be found to deserve the regard of this assembly , though I am , equally with the other members , a stranger to what it contains  for it is my opinion that a representative is to lay before the house the sentiments of his constituents , whether they agree with his own or not , and that , therefore , it would have been superfluous to examine the petition , which , though I might not wholly have approved it , I had no right to alter .


The petition was read , and is as follows :


`` The humble petition of the merchants and traders of the city of London -- showeth , that your petitioners are informed a bill is depending in this honourable house , for the encouragement and increase of seamen , and for the better and speedier manning his majesty 's fleet , in which are clauses , that , should the bill pass into a law , your petitioners apprehend will be highly detrimental to the trade and navigation of this kingdom , by discouraging persons from entering into or being bred to the sea service , and entirely prevent the better and speedier manning his majesty 's fleet , by giving the seamen of Great Britain , and of all other his majesty 's dominions , a distaste of serving on board the royal navy .


`` That your petitioners conceive nothing can be of so bad consequence to the welfare and defence of this nation , as the treating so useful and valuable a body of men , who are its natural strength and security , like criminals of the highest nature , and so differently from all other his majesty 's subjects  and at the same time are persuaded , that the only effectual and speedy method of procuring , for the service of his majesty 's fleet , a proportionable number of the sailors in this kingdom , is to distinguish that body of men by bounties and encouragements , both present and future , and by abolishing all methods of severity and ill usage , particularly that practice whereby they are deprived , after long and hazardous voyages , of enjoying , for a short space of time , the comforts of their families , and equal liberty with other their fellow-subjects in their native country .


`` That your petitioners believe it will not be difficult to have such methods pointed out as will tend to supply the present necessities , and at the same time effectually promote the increase of seamen , when this honourable house shall think fit to inquire into a matter of such high importance to the naval power , trade , and riches of this kingdom .


`` That your petitioners are convinced this bill will not only be ineffectual to answer the ends proposed by it , but will be destructive of the liberties of all his majesty 's subjects , as it empowers any parish officer , accompanied with an unlimited number of persons , at any hour , by day or by night , to force open the dwelling-houses , warehouses , or other places , provided for the security and defence of their lives and fortunes , contrary to the undoubted liberties of the people of Great Britain , and the laws of this land .


`` In consideration , therefore , of the premises , and of the particular prejudices , hardships , and dangers , which must inevitably attend your petitioners , and all others the merchants and traders of this kingdom , should this bill pass into a law , your petitioners most humbly pray this honourable house , that they may be heard by their counsel against the said clauses in the said bill . ''


Mr. BATHURST then presented a petition , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , the alarm which the bill , now depending , has raised , is not confined to the city of London , or to any particular province of the king 's dominions  the whole nation is thrown into commotions , and the effects of the law now proposed , are dreaded , far and wide , as a general calamity .
Every town which owes its trade and its provisions to navigation , apprehends the approach of poverty and scarcity , and those which are less immediately affected , consider the infraction of our liberties as a prelude to their destruction .
Happy would it be , if we , who are intrusted with their interest , could find any arguments to convince them that their terrour was merely panick .


That these fears have already extended their influence to the county which I represent , the petition which I now beg leave to lay before the house , will sufficiently evince  and I hope their remonstrances will prevail with this assembly to remove the cause of their disquiet , by rejecting the bill .


This was entitled `` a petition of several gentlemen , freeholders , and other inhabitants of the county of Gloucester , in behalf of themselves , and all other , the freeholders of the said county , '' setting forth , in substance , `` That the petitioners being informed that a bill was depending in this house , for the encouragement and increase of seamen , and for the better and speedier manning his majesty 's fleet , containing several clauses which , should the bill pass into a law , would , as the petitioners apprehend , impose hardships upon the people too heavy to be borne , and create discontents in the minds of his majesty 's subjects  would subvert all the rights and privileges of a Briton  and overturn Magna Charta itself , the basis on which they are built  and , by these means , destroy that very liberty , for the preservation of which the present royal family was established upon the throne of Britain  for which reasons , such a law could never be obeyed , or much blood would be shed in consequence of it . ''


Mr. Henry PELHAM then spoke , to this purport : -- Sir , I have attended to this petition with the utmost impartiality , and have endeavoured to affix , to every period , the most innocent sense  but can not forbear to declare it as my opinion , that it is far distant from the style of submission and request : instead of persuading , they attempt to intimidate us , and menace us with no less than bloodshed and rebellion .
They make themselves the judges of our proceedings , and appeal , from our determinations , to their own opinion , and declare that they will obey no longer than they approve .


If such petitions as these , sir , are admitted  if the legislature shall submit to receive laws , and subjects resume , at pleasure , the power with which the government is vested , what is this assembly but a convention of empty phantoms , whose determinations are nothing more than a mockery of state ?


Every insult upon this house is a violation of our constitution  and the constitution , like every other fabrick , by being often battered , must fall at last .
It is , indeed , already destroyed , if there be , in the nation , any body of men who shall , with impunity , refuse to comply with the laws , plead the great charter of liberty against those powers that made it , and fix the limits of their own obedience .


I can not , sir , pass over , in silence , the mention of the king , whose title to the throne , and the reasons for which he was exalted to it , are set forth with uncommon art and spirit of diction  but spirit , which , in my opinion , appears not raised by zeal , but by sedition  and which , therefore , it is our province to repress .


That his majesty reigns for the preservation of liberty , will be readily confessed  but how shall we be able to preserve it , if his laws are not obeyed ?


Let us , therefore , in regard to the dignity of the assembly , to the efficacy of our determinations , and the security of our constitution , discourage all those who shall address us for the future , on this or any other occasion , from speaking in the style of governours and dictators , by refusing that this petition should be laid on the table .


[ The question was put , and it was agreed , by the whole house , that it should not lie on the table . ]


Mr. Henry PELHAM rose up again , and spoke thus : -- Sir , I can not but congratulate the house upon the unanimity with which this petition , a petition of which I speak in the softest language , when I call it irreverent and disrespectful , has been refused the regard commonly paid to the remonstrances of our constituents , whose rights I am far from desiring to infringe , when I endeavour to regulate their conduct , and recall them to their duty .


This is an occasion , on which it is , in my opinion , necessary to exert our authority with confidence and vigour , as the spirit of opposition must always be proportioned to that of the attack .
Let us , therefore , not only refuse to this petition the usual place on our table , but reject it as unworthy of this house .


[ The question was put , and the petition rejected , with scarcely any opposition . ]


The house then entered upon the consideration of the bill , and when the report was made from the committee , and the blanks filled up , sir William YONGE spoke , in the following manner : --


Sir , the bill has been brought , by steady perseverance and diligent attention , to such perfection , that much more important effects may be expected from it than from any former law for the same purpose , if it be executed with the same calmness and resolution , the same contempt of popular clamour , and the same invariable and intrepid adherence to the publick good , that has been shown in forming and defending it .


But what can we hope from this , or any other law , if particular men , who can not be convinced of its expedience , shall not only refuse to obey it , but declare their design of obstructing the execution of it ?
shall determine to retire from the sphere of their authority , rather than exercise it in compliance with the decree of the senate , and threaten , in plain terms , to call the country in to their assistance , and to pour the rabble by thousands upon those who shall dare to do their duty , and obey their governours ?


Such declarations as these , sir , are little less than sallies of rebellion  and , if they pass without censure , will , perhaps , produce such commotions as may require to be suppressed by other means than forms of law and senatorial censures .


Nor do I think that , by rejecting the petition , we have sufficiently established our authority  for , in my opinion , we yielded too much in receiving it .
The bill before us whatever may be its title , is , in reality , a money bill  a bill , by which aids are granted to the crown  and we have , therefore , no necessity of rejecting petitions on this occasion , because the standing orders of the house forbid us to admit them .


They then proceeded to the amendments , and when the clause for limiting the wages of seamen was read , sir John BARNARD rose up , and spoke to this effect : --


Sir , we are now to consider the clause to which the petition relates , which I have now presented , a petition on a subject of so general importance , and offered by men so well acquainted with every argument that can be offered , and every objection which can be raised , that their request of being heard by their council can not be denied , without exposing us to the censure of adhering obstinately to our own opinions , of shutting our ears against information , of preferring expedition to security , and disregarding the welfare of our country .


It will not be necessary to defer our determinations on this clause for more than three days , though we should gratify this just and common request .
And will not this loss be amply compensated by the satisfaction of the people , for whose safety we are debating , and by the consciousness that we have neglected nothing which might contribute to the efficacy of our measures ?


The merchants , sir , do not come before us with loud remonstrances and harassing complaints , they do not apply to our passions , but our understandings , and offer such informations as will very much facilitate the publick service .
It has been frequent , in the course of this debate , to hear loud demands for better expedients , and more efficacious , than those which have been proposed  and is it to be conceived that those who called thus eagerly for new proposals , intended not to inform themselves , but to silence their opponents ?


From whom , sir , are the best methods for the prosecution of naval affairs to be expected , but from those whose lives are spent in the study of commerce , whose fortunes depend upon the knowledge of the sea , and who will , most probably , exert their abilities in contriving expedients to promote the success of the war , than they whom the miscarriage of our fleets must irreparably ruin ?


The merchants , sir , are enabled by their profession to inform us -- are deterred by their interest from deceiving us  they have , like all other subjects , a right to be heard on any question  and a better right than any other when their interest is more immediately affected  and , therefore , to refuse to hear them , will be , at once , impolitick and cruel  it will discover , at the same time , a contempt of the most valuable part of our fellow-subjects , and an inflexible adherence to our own opinions .


The expedient of asserting this to be a money bill , by which the just remonstrances of the merchants are intended to be eluded , is too trivial and gross to be adopted by this assembly : if this bill can be termed a money bill , and no petitions are , therefore , to be admitted against it , I know not any bill relating to the general affairs of the nation which may not plead the same title to an exemption from petitions .


I therefore desire that the consideration of this clause may be deferred for two days , that the arguments of the merchants may be examined , and that this affair may not be determined without the clearest knowledge and exactest information .


Sir Robert WALPOLE spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , the petition , whether justifiable or not , with regard to the occasion on which it is presented , or the language in which it is expressed , is certainly offered at an improper time , and , therefore , can lay no claim to the regard of this assembly .


The time prescribed , by the rules of this house , for the reception of petitions , is that at which the bill is first introduced , not at which it is to be finally determined .


The petition before us is said not to regard the bill in general , but a particular clause  and it is , therefore , asserted , that it may now properly be heard : but this plea will immediately vanish , when it shall be made appear that the clause is not mentioned in it , and that there is no particular relation between that and the petition , which I shall attempt --


Here sir John BARNARD , remarking that sir Robert WALPOLE had the petition in his hand , rose , and said : -- Sir , I rise thus abruptly to preserve the order of this assembly , and to prevent any gentleman from having , in this debate , any other advantage , above the rest , than that of superiour abilities , or more extensive knowledge .


The petition was not ordered , by the house , to be placed in the right honourable gentleman 's hand , but on the table  nor has he a right to make use of any other means for his information , than are in the power of any other member : if he is in doubt upon any particulars contained in it , he may move that the clerk should read it to the house .


Sir Robert WALPOLE laid down the paper  Mr. PELHAM rose , and said : -- Sir , I am so far from thinking the rules of the house asserted , that , in my opinion , the right of the members is infringed by this peremptory demand .
Is it not , in the highest degree , requisite , that he who is about to reason upon the petition should acquaint himself with the subject on which he is to speak .


What inconveniencies can ensue from such liberties as this , I am not able to discover  and , as all the orders of the house are , doubtless , made for more easy and expeditious despatch , if an order be contrary to this end , it ought to be abrogated for the reasons for which others are observed .


The confidence with which this petition was presented , will not suffer us to imagine that the person who offered it fears that it can suffer by a close examination  and I suppose , though he has spoken so warmly in favour of it , without perusing , he does not expect that others should with equal confidence admit --


Sir John BARNARD observing that sir Robert WALPOLE leaned forward towards the table , to read the petition as it lay , rose , and said : -- Sir , I rise once more to demand the observation of the orders of the house , and to hinder the right honourable gentleman from doing by stratagem , what he did more openly and honestly before .


It was to little purpose that he laid down the petition , if he placed it within reach of his inspection ?
for I was only desirous , sir , to hinder him from reading , and was far from suspecting that he would take it away .
I insist , that henceforward , he obey the rules of this assembly , with his eyes as well as with his hands , and take no advantage of his seat , which may enable him to perplex the question in debate .


Then the PRESIDENT spoke thus : -- Sir , it is , undoubtedly , required by the orders of the house , that the petitions should lie upon the table  and that any member , who is desirous of any farther satisfaction , should move that they be read by the clerk , that every member may have the same opportunity of understanding and considering them  and that no one may be excluded from information , by the curiosity or delays of another .
But the importance of this affair seems not to be so very great as to require a rigorous observance of the rules  and it were to be wished , for the ease and expedition of our deliberations , that gentlemen would rather yield points of indifference to one another , than insist so warmly on circumstances of a trivial nature .


Sir Robert WALPOLE then desired that the clerk might read the petition , which being immediately done , he proceeded in the following manner : --


Sir , having sat above forty years in this assembly , and never been called to order before , I was somewhat disconcerted by a censure so new and unexpected , and , in my opinion , undeserved .
So that I am somewhat at a loss , with regard to the train of arguments which I had formed , and which I will now endeavour to recover .
Yet I can not but remark , that those gentlemen who are so solicitous for order in others , ought , themselves , invariably to observe it  and that if I have once given an unhappy precedent of violating the rules of this house , I have , in some measure , atoned for my inadvertence , by a patient attention to reproof , and a ready submission to authority .


I hope , sir , I may claim some indulgence from the motive of my offence , which was only a desire of accuracy , and an apprehension that I might , by mistaking or forgetting some passages in the petition , lose my own time , and interrupt the proceedings of the house to no purpose .


But having now , according to order , heard the petition , and found no reason to alter my opinion , I shall endeavour to convince the house that it ought not to be granted .


The petition , sir , is so far from bearing any particular relation to the clause now before us , that it does not , in any part , mention the expedient proposed in it , but contains a general declaration of discontent , suspicion , apprehensions of dangerous proceedings , and dislike of our proceedings  insinuations , sir , by no means consistent with the reverence due to this assembly , and which the nature of civil government requires always to be paid to the legislative power .


To suspect any man , sir , in common life , is in some degree to detract from his reputation , which must suffer in proportion to the supposed wisdom and integrity of him who declares his suspicion .
To suspect the conduct of this senate , is to invalidate their decisions , and subject them to contempt and opposition .


Such , and such only , appears to be the tendency of the petition which has now been read  a petition , sir , very unskilfully drawn , if it was intended against the clause under our consideration , for it has not a single period or expression that does not equally regard all the other clauses .


If any particular objection is made , or any single grievance more distinctly pointed at , it is the practice of impresses , a hardship , I own , peculiar to the sailors  but it must be observed that it is a practice established by immemorial custom , and a train of precedents not to be numbered  and it is well known that the whole common law of this nation is nothing more than custom , of which the beginning can not be traced .


Impresses , sir , have in all ages been issued out by virtue of the imperial prerogative , and have in all ages been obeyed  and if this exertion of the authority had been considered as a method of severity not compensated by the benefits which it produces , we can not imagine but former senates , amidst all their ardour for liberty , all their tenderness for the people , and all their abhorrence of the power of the crown , would have obviated it by some law , at those times when nothing could have been refused them .


The proper time for new schemes and long deliberations , for amending our constitution , and removing inveterate grievances , are the days of prosperity and safety , when no immediate danger presses upon us , nor any publick calamity appears to threaten us  but when war is declared , when we are engaged in open hostilities against one nation , and expect to be speedily attacked by another , we are not to try experiments , but apply to dangerous evils those remedies , which , though disagreeable , we know to be efficacious .


And though , sir , the petitioners have been more particular , I can not discover the reasonableness of hearing them by their council  for to what purpose are the lawyers to be introduced ?
Not to instruct us by their learning , for their employment is to understand the laws that have been already made , and support the practices which they find established .
But the question before us relates not to the past but the future , nor are we now to examine what has been done in former ages , but what it will become us to establish on the present occasion  a subject of inquiry on which this house can expect very little information from the professors of the law ?


Perhaps the petitioners expect from their counsel , that they should display the fecundity of their imagination , and the elegance of their language  that they should amuse us with the illusions of oratory , dazzle us with bright ideas , affect us with strong representations , and lull us with harmonious periods  but if it be only intended that just facts and valid arguments should be laid before us , they will be received without the decorations of the bar .
For this end , sir , it would have been sufficient had the merchants informed their representatives of the methods which they have to propose  for the abilities of the gentlemen whom the city has deputed to this assembly , are well known to be such as stand in need of no assistance from occasional orators .
Nor can it be expected that any men will be found more capable of understanding the arguments of the merchants , or better qualified to lay them before the senate .


That every petitioner has , except on money bills , a right to be heard , is undoubtedly true  but it is no less evident that this right is limited to a certain time , and that on this occasion the proper time is elapsed .
Justice is due both to individuals and to the nation  if petitions may at any time be offered , and are , whenever offered , to be heard , a small body of men might , by unseasonable and importunate petitions , retard any occasional law , till it should become unnecessary .


Petitions , sir , are to be offered when a new bill is brought into the house , that all useful information may be obtained  but when it has passed through the examination of the committees , has been approved by the collective wisdom of the senate , and requires only a formal ratification to give it the force of a law , it is neither usual nor decent to offer petitions , or declare any dislike of what the senate has admitted .


We are not , when we have proceeded thus far , to suffer pleaders to examine our conduct , or vary our determinations , according to the opinions of those whom we ought to believe less acquainted with the question than ourselves .
Should we once be reduced to ask advice , and submit to dictators , what would be the reputation of this assembly in foreign courts , or in our own country ?
What could be expected , but that our enemies of every kind would endeavour to regulate our determinations by bribing our instructers .


Nor can I think it necessary that lawyers should be employed in laying before us any scheme which the merchants may propose , for supplying the defects , and redressing the inconveniencies , of the laws by which sailors are at present levied for the royal navy  for how should lawyers be more qualified than other men , to explain the particular advantages of such expedients , or to answer any objections which may happen to rise ?


It is well known that it is not easy for the most happy speaker to impress his notions with the strength with which he conceives them , and yet harder is the task of transmitting imparted knowledge , of conveying to others those sentiments which we have not struck out by our own reflection , nor collected from our own experience , but received merely from the dictates of another .


Yet such must be the information that lawyers can give us , who can only relate what they have implicitly received , and weaken the arguments which they have heard , by an imperfect recital .


Nor do I only oppose the admission of lawyers to our bar , but think the right of the merchants themselves , in the present case , very questionable  for though in general it must be allowed , that every petitioner has a claim to our attention , yet it is to be inquired whether it is likely that the publick happiness is his chief concern , and whether his private interest is not too much affected to suffer him to give impartial evidence , or honest information .
Scarcely any law can be made by which some man is not either impoverished , or hindered from growing rich  and we are not to listen to complaints , of which the foundation is so easily discovered , or imagine a law less useful , because those who suffer some immediate inconvenience from it , do not approve it .


The question before us is required , by the present exigence of our affairs , to be speedily decided  and though the merchants have , with great tenderness , compassion , and modesty , condescended to offer us their advice , I think expedition preferable to any information that can reasonably be expected from them , and that as they will suffer , in the first place , by any misconduct of our naval affairs , we shall show more regard to their interest by manning our fleet immediately , than by waiting three or four days for farther instructions .


Mr. SANDYS answered to this effect : -- Sir , the merchants of London whether we consider their numbers , their property , their integrity , or their wisdom , are a body of too much importance to be thus contemptuously rejected  rejected when they ask nothing that can be justly denied to the meanest subject of the empire , when they propose to speak on nothing but what their profession enables them to understand .


To no purpose is it urged , that the bill is far advanced , for if we have not proceeded in the right way , we ought to be in more haste to return , in proportion as we have gone farther  nor can I discover why we should expedite , with so much assiduity , measures which are judged ineffectual , by those who know their consequences best , and for whose advantage they are particularly designed .


That we have already spent so much time in considering methods for manning the fleet , is surely one reason why we should endeavour at last to establish such as may be effectual  nor can we hope to succeed without a patient attention to their opinion , who must necessarily be well experienced in naval affairs .


It is surely , therefore , neither prudent nor just to shut out intelligence from our assemblies , and ridicule the good intention of those that offer it , to consult upon the best expedients for encouraging and increasing sailors , and when the merchants offer their scheme , to treat them as saucy , impertinent , idle meddlers , that assume --


Here the ATTORNEY GENERAL called him to order , and spoke after this manner : -- Sir , it is not very consistent to press the despatch of business , and to retard it , at the same time , by invidious insinuations , or unjust representations of arguments or expressions : whenever any expression is censured , it ought to be repeated in the same words  for otherwise , does not the animadverter raise the phantom that he encounters ?
Does he not make the stain , which he endeavours , with so much officious zeal , to wipe away .


That no epithets of contempt or ridicule have , in this debate , been applied to the merchants , nor any violation of decency attempted , it is unnecessary to prove , and , therefore , it is neither regular nor candid to represent any man as aggravating the refusal of their petition with reproaches and insults .
But not to dwell longer on this incident , I will take the liberty of reminding the gentleman , that personal invectives are always , at least superfluous , and that the business of the day requires rather arguments than satire .


Mr. SANDYS then spoke as follows : -- Sir , I am by no means convinced that the learned gentleman who charges me with irregularity , is better acquainted than myself with the rules and customs of this house , which I have studied with great application , assisted by long experience .
I hope , therefore , it will be no inexcusable presumption , if , instead of a tacit submission to his censure , I assert , in my own vindication , that I have not deviated from the established rules of the senate , that I have spoken only in defence of merit insulted , and that I have condemned only such injurious insinuations .
I did not , sir , attempt to repeat expressions , as ought not to be heard without reply .


Then the PRESIDENT said : -- I believe the gentleman either heard imperfectly , or misunderstood these expressions , which he so warmly condemns , for nothing has been uttered that could justly excite his indignation .
My office obliges me on this occasion to remark , that the regard due to the dignity of the house ought to restrain every member from digressions into private satire  for in proportion as we proceed with less decency , our determinations will have less influence .


Mr. PELHAM spoke next , in substance as follows : -- Sir , the reputation which the honourable gentleman has acquired by his uncommon knowledge of the usages of the senate , is too well founded to be shaken , nor was any attack upon his character intended , when he was interrupted in the prosecution of his design .
To censure any indecent expression , by whomsoever uttered , is , doubtless , consistent with the strictest regularity  nor is it less proper to obviate any misrepresentation which inattention or mistake may produce .


I am far , sir , from thinking that the gentleman 's indignation was excited rather by malice than mistake  but mistakes of this kind may produce consequences which can not be too cautiously avoided .
How unwillingly would that gentleman propagate through the nation an opinion that the merchants were insulted in this house , their interest neglected , and their intelligence despised , at a time when no aspersion was thrown upon them , nor any thing intended but tenderness and regard ?
And yet such had been the representation of this day 's debate , which this numerous audience would have conveyed to the populace , had not the mistake been immediately rectified , and the rumour crushed in the birth .


Nothing , sir , can be more injurious to the character of this assembly , by which the people are represented , than to accuse them of treating any class of men with insolence and contempt  and too much diligence can not be used in obviating a report which can not be spread in the nation , without giving rise to discontent , clamours , and sedition .


Those who shall be inclined to reject the petition , may , perhaps , act with no less regard to the merchants , and may promote their interest and their security with no less ardour than those who most solicitously labour for its reception : for , if they are not allowed to be heard , it is only because the publick interest requires expedition , and because every delay of our preparations is an injury to trade .


That this is not a proper time for petitions against the bill to be heard , is universally known  and I can discover nothing in the petition that restrains it to this particular clause , which is so far from being specified , that it appears to be the only part of the bill of which they have had no intelligence .


Let the warmest advocates for the petition point out any part of it that relates to this single clause , and I will retract my assertion  but as it appears that there are only general declarations of the inexpediency of the measures proposed , and the pernicious tendency of the methods now in use , what is the petition , but a complaint against the bill , and a request that it should be laid aside .


The practice of impresses , sir , is particularly censured , as severe and oppressive  a charge which , however true , has no relation to this clause , which is intended to promote the voluntary engagement of sailors in the service of the crown  yet it may not be improper to observe , that as the practice of impressing is , in itself , very efficacious , and well adapted to sudden emergencies  as it has been established by a long succession of ages , and is , therefore , become almost a part of our constitution  and as it is at this time necessary to supply the navy with the utmost expedition , it is neither decent nor prudent to complain too loudly against , or to heighten the discontent of the people at a necessary evil .


We have , sir , examined every part of this bill with the attention which the defence of the nation requires  we have softened the rigour of the methods first proposed , and admitted no violence or hardship that is not absolutely necessary , to make the law effectual , which , like every other law , must be executed by force , if it be obstructed or opposed .
We have inserted a great number of amendments , proposed by those who are represented as the most anxious guardians of the privileges of the people  and it is not , surely , to no purpose that the great council of the nation has so long and so studiously laboured .


Those who are chosen by the people to represent them , have undoubtedly , sir , some claim as individuals to their confidence and respect  for to imagine that they have committed the great charge of senatorial employments , that they have trusted their liberties and their happiness to those whose integrity they suspect , or whose understandings they despise , is to imagine them much more stupid than they have been represented by those who are censured as their enemies .


But far different is the regard due to the determinations formed by the collective wisdom of the senate  a regard which ought to border upon reverence , and which is scarcely consistent with the least murmur of dissatisfaction .


If we are to hear the present petitioners , is it not probable , that before we have despatched them , we shall be solicited by others , who will then plead the same right , supported by a new precedent ?
And is it not possible that by one interruption upon another , our measures may be delayed , till they shall be ineffectual ?


It seems to me to be of much more importance to defend the merchants than to hear them  and I shall , therefore , think no concessions at this time expedient , which may obstruct the great end of our endeavours , the equipment of the fleet .


Mr. PULTENEY then spoke as follows : -- Sir , notwithstanding the art and eloquence with which this grant of the merchants ' petition has been opposed , I am not yet able to discover that any thing is asked unreasonable , unprecedented , or inconvenient  and I am confident , that no real objection can have been overlooked by the gentlemen who have spoken against it .


I have spent , sir , thirty-five years of my life in the senate , and know that information has always , upon important questions , been willingly received  and it can not surely be doubted that the petitioners are best able to inform us of naval business , and to judge what will be the right method of reconciling the sailors to the publick service , and of supplying our fleets without injuring our trade .


Their abilities and importance have been hitherto so generally acknowledged , that no senate has yet refused to attend to their opinion  and surely we ought not to be ambitious of being the first assembly of the representatives of the people , that has refused an audience to the merchants .


With regard to the expedience of delaying the bill at the present conjuncture , he must think very contemptuously of the petitioners , who imagines that they have nothing to offer that will counterbalance a delay of two days , and must entertain an elevated idea of the vigilance and activity of our enemies , enemies never before eminent for expedition , if he believes that they can gain great advantages in so short a time .


The chief reason of the opposition appears , indeed , not to be either the irregularity or inexpediency of hearing them , but the offence which some have received from an irreverent mention of the power of impressing , a power which never can be mentioned without complaint or detestation .


It is not , indeed , impossible that they may intend to represent to the house , how much the sailors are oppressed , how much our commerce is impeded , and how much the power of the nation is exhausted , by this cruel method .
They may propose to show that sailors , not having the choice of their voyages , are often hurried through a sudden change of climates , from one extreme to another , and that nothing can be expected from such vicissitudes , but sickness , lameness , and death .
They may propose , that to have just arrived from the south may be pleaded as an exemption from an immediate voyage to the north , and that the seaman may have some time to prepare himself for so great an alteration , by a residence of a few months in a temperate climate .


If this should be their intention , it can not , in my opinion , sir , be called either unreasonable or disrespectful , nor will their allegations be easily disproved .


But it is insinuated , that their grievances are probably such as affect them only as distinct from the rest of the community , and that they have nothing to complain of but a temporary interruption of their private advantage .


I have , indeed , no idea of the private advantage of a legal trader : for unless , sir , we neglect our duty of providing that no commerce shall be carried on to the detriment of the publick , the merchant 's profit must be the profit of the nation , and their interests inseparably combined .


It may , however , be possible , that the merchants may , like other men , prefer their immediate to their greater advantage , and may be impatient of a painful remedy , though necessary to prevent a more grievous evil .
But let us not censure them by suspicion , and punish them for a crime which it is only possible they may commit  let us , sir , at least have all the certainty that can be obtained , and allow them an audience  let us neither be so positive as not to receive information , nor so rigorous as not to listen to entreaties .


If the merchants have nothing to offer , nothing but complaints , and can propose no better measures than those which they lament , if their arguments should be found to regard only their present interest , and to be formed upon narrow views and private purposes , it will be easy to detect the imposture , and reject it with the indignation it shall deserve  nor will our proceedings be then censured by the nation , which requires not that the merchants should be implicitly believed , though it expects that they should be heard .
Let us at least have a convention , though we should not be able to conclude a treaty .


I know not , sir , why we have not taken care to obviate all these difficulties , and to remove the necessity of petitions , debates , searches , and impresses , by the plain and easy method of a voluntary register  by retaining such a number of seamen as may probably be requisite upon sudden emergencies .
Would not the nation with more cheerfulness contribute half-pay to those who are daily labouring for the publick good , than to the caterpillars of the land service , that grow old in laziness , and are disabled only by vice ?


Let ten thousand men receive daily a small salary , upon condition that they shall be ready , whenever called upon , to engage in the service of the crown , and the difficulty of our naval preparations will be at an end .


That it is necessary to exert ourselves on this occasion , and to strike out some measures for securing the dominion of the ocean , can not be denied by any one who considers that we have now no other pretensions to maintain  that all our influence on the continent , at whatever expense gained and supported , is now in a manner lost , and only the reputation of our naval strength remains to preserve us from being trampled on and insulted by every power , and from finding Spaniards in every climate .


Sir William YONGE spoke , in substance , as follows : -- Sir , the violence and severity of impresses , so often and so pathetically complained of , appears to be now nothing more than a punishment inflicted upon those who neglect or refuse to receive the encouragement offered , with the utmost liberality , by the government , and decline the service of their country from a spirit of avarice , obstinacy , or resentment .


That such men deserve some severities , can not be doubted , and therefore a law by which no penalty should be enacted , would be imperfect and ineffectual .
The observation , sir , of all laws is to be enforced by rewards on one side , and punishments on the other , that every passion may be influenced , and even our weakness made instrumental to the performance of our duty .


In the bill before us no punishment is , indeed , expressly decreed , because the sailors who shall disregard it , are only left to their former hardships , from which those who engage voluntarily in the service of the navy are exempted .


Why so many rewards and so much violence should be necessary to allure or force the sailors into the publick service , I am unable to comprehend : for , excepting the sudden change of climates , which may , doubtless , sometimes bring on distempers , the service of the king has no disadvantages which are not common to that of the merchants .


The wages in the navy are , indeed , less : but then it is to be remembered , that they are certainly paid , and that the sailor is in less danger of losing , by a tempest or a wreck , the whole profits of his voyage  because , if he can preserve his life , he receives his pay .
But in trading voyages , the seamen mortgage their wages , as a security for their care , which , if the ship is lost , they are condemned to forfeit .


Thus , sir , the hardships of the navy appear not so great when compared with those of the merchants ' service , as they have been hitherto represented  and I doubt not , that if counsellors were to be heard on both sides , the measures taken for supplying the fleet would be found to be reasonable and just .


Sir John BARNARD rose to speak , when Mr. FOX called to order , and proceeded :


Sir , it is well known to be one of the standing and unvariable orders of this house , that no member shall speak twice in a debate on the same question , except when for greater freedom we resolve ourselves into a committee .
Upon this question the honourable gentleman has already spoken , and can not , therefore , be heard again without such a transgression of our orders as must inevitably produce confusion .


Sir John BARNARD spoke thus : -- Sir , I know not for what reason the honourable gentleman apprehends any violation of the order of the house  for , as I have not yet spoken upon the present question , I have an undoubted right to be heard , a right which that gentleman can not take away .


Sir William YONGE next spoke , to this effect : -- Sir , I know not by what secret distinction the gentleman supports in his own mind this declaration , which , to the whole house , must appear very difficult to be defended  for we must , before we can admit it , allow our memories to have forsaken us , and our eyes and ears to have been deceived .


Did he not , as soon as the clause before us was read , rise and assert the characters of the petitioners , and their right to the attention of the house ?
Did he not dwell upon their importance , their abilities , and their integrity  and enforce , with his usual eloquence , every motive to the reception of the petition ?
How then can he assert that he has not spoken in the present debate , and how can he expect to be heard a second time , since , however his eloquence may please , and his arguments convince , that pleasure and conviction can not now be obtained , without infringing the standing orders of the house .


Then the PRESIDENT rose , and spoke to this purport : It is not without uneasiness that I see the time of the house , and of the publick , wasted in fruitless cavils and unnecessary controversies .
Every gentleman ought now to consider that we are consulting upon no trivial question , and that expedition is not less necessary than accuracy .
It can not be denied , sir , [ to sir John BARNARD ] that you have already spoken on this question , and that the rules of the house do not allow you to speak a second time .


Sir Robert WALPOLE said : -- Sir , I am far from thinking the order of the house so sacred , as that it may not be neglected on some important occasions  and if the gentleman has any thing to urge so momentous , that , in his own opinion , it outweighs the regard due to our rules , I shall willingly consent that he shall be heard .


Sir John BARNARD spoke as follows : -- Sir , I am far from being inclined to receive as a favour , what , in my own opinion , I may claim as a right , and desire not to owe the liberty of speaking to the condescension of the right honourable gentleman .


What I have to urge is no less against the bill in general , than the particular clause now immediately under our consideration , and though the petition should relate likewise to the whole bill , I can not discover why we should refuse to hear it .


Petitions from men of much inferiour rank , and whose interest is much less closely connected with that of the publick , have been thought necessary to be heard , nor is the meanest individual to be injured or restrained , without being admitted to offer his arguments in his own favour .
Even the journeymen shoemakers , one of the lowest classes of the community , have been permitted to bring their counsel to our bar , and remonstrate against the inconveniencies to which they were afraid of being subjected .


Mr. WINNINGTON spoke thus : -- Sir , I am always willing to hear petitions , when respectfully drawn up , and regularly subscribed , but can by no means discover that this is a real petition , for I have heard of no names affixed to it  it is , therefore , a request from nobody , and by rejecting it no man is refused .
It may , so far as can be discovered , be drawn up by the gentleman who offered it , and , perhaps , no other person may be acquainted with it .


Mr. HAY spoke to the following purport : -- Sir , it is , in my opinion , necessary that a petition in the name of the merchants of London should be subscribed by the whole number , for if only a few should put their names to it , how does it appear that it is any thing more than an apprehension of danger to their own particular interest , which , perhaps , the other part , their rivals in trade , may consider as an advantage , or at least regard with indifference .
This suspicion is much more reasonable , when a petition is subscribed by a smaller number , who may easily be imagined to have partial views , and designs not wholly consistent with the interest of the publick .


Admiral WAGER then spoke thus : -- Sir , if I am rightly informed , another petition is preparing by several eminent merchants , that this clause may stand part of the bill  and , certainly , they ought to be heard as well as the present petitioners , which will occasion great and unnecessary delays , and , therefore , I am against the motion .


Advocate CAMPBELL answered to this effect : -- Sir , I agree with that honourable gentleman , that if the merchants are divided in opinion upon this point , one side ought to be heard as well as the other , and hope the house will come to a resolution for that purpose : for I shall invariably promote every proposal which tends to procure the fullest information in all affairs that shall come before us .


[ Then the question was put , that the farther consideration of the report be adjourned for two days , in order to hear the merchants , and it passed in the negative , ayes , 142  noes , 192 . ]


[ On the report this day , the eleven clauses of severity were given up without any division , and a clause was added , viz .
`` Provided that nothing in this bill shall be construed to extend to any contracts or agreements for the hire of seamen ( or persons employed as such ) in voyages from parts beyond the seas , to any other parts beyond the seas , or to Great Britain . '' ]


The engrossed bill `` for the increase and encouragement of seamen , '' was read , according to order , when Mr. DIGBY rose , and spoke as follows : --


Sir , I have a clause to be offered to the house , as necessary to be inserted in the bill before us , which was put into my hands by a member , whom a sudden misfortune has made unable to attend his duty , and which , in his opinion , and mine , is of great importance , and I shall , therefore , take the liberty of reading it .


`` Be it enacted , that every seaman offering himself to serve his majesty , shall , upon being refused , receive from such captain , lieutenant , or justice of the peace , a certificate , setting forth the reasons for which he is refused , which certificate may be produced by him , as an exemption from being seized by a warrant of impress . ''


I hope the reasonableness and equity of this clause is so incontestably apparent , that it will find no opposition  for what can be more cruel , unjust , or oppressive , than to punish men for neglect of a law which they have endeavoured to obey .
To what purpose are rewards offered , if they are denied to those who come to claim them ?
What is it less than theft , and fraud , to force a man into the service , who would willingly have entered , and subject him to hardships , without the recompense which he may justly demand from the solemn promise of the legislature .


Admiral WAGER next spoke to this effect : -- Sir , to this clause , which the gentleman has represented as so reasonable and just , objections may , in my opinion , be easily made , of which he will himself acknowledge the force .
The great obstruction of publick measures is partiality , whether from friendship , bribery , or any other motive  against partiality alone the clause which is now offered , is levelled  and , indeed , it is so dangerous an evil , that it can not be obviated with too much caution .


But this clause , instead of preventing private correspondence , and illegal combinations , has an evident tendency to produce them , by inciting men to apply with pretended offers of service to those who are before suborned to refuse them , then make a merit of their readiness , and demand a certificate .


By such artifices multitudes may exempt themselves from the impress , who may be known to be able sailors , even by those that conduct it  and may , under the protection of a certificate , fallaciously obtained , laugh at all endeavours to engage them in the publick service .


Mr. DIGBY spoke thus : -- Sir , if this authority , lodged in the hands of those who are proposed in the clause to be intrusted with it , be in danger of being executed , without due regard to the end for which it is granted , let it be placed where there is neither temptation nor opportunity to abuse it .
Let the admiralty alone have the power of granting such certificates , the officers of which will be able to judge whether the sailor is really unfit for the service , and deliver those whom age or accidents have disabled from the terrour of impresses  for surely , he that is fit to serve , when taken by violence , is no less qualified when he enters voluntarily , and he who could not be admitted when he tendered himself , ought not to be dragged away , when , perhaps , he has contracted for another voyage .


Mr. WAGER replied : -- Sir , it is , doubtless , more proper to place such authority in the officers of the admiralty , than in any other  but it does not appear that the benefit which the sailors may receive from it , to whatever hands it is intrusted , will not be overbalanced by the injury which the publick will probably suffer .


Sailors are frequently levied in remote parts of the kingdom  in ports where the admiralty can not speedily be informed of the reasons for which those that may petition for certificates have been refused , and therefore can not grant them without danger of being deceived by fraudulent accounts .


The grievance for which the remedy is proposed can not frequently occur  for it is not probable that in a time of naval preparations , any man qualified for the service should be rejected , since the officers gain nothing by their refusal .


Mr. HAY spoke as follows : -- Sir , it is very possible that those instances which may be produced of men , who have been impressed by one officer , after they have been rejected by another , may be only the consequences of the high value which every man is ready to set upon his own abilities : for he that offers himself , no doubt , demands the highest premium , though he be not an able sailor  and , if rejected , and afterwards impressed as a novice , thinks himself at liberty to complain , with the most importunate vehemence , of fraud , partiality , and oppression .


[ The question being put was resolved in the negative , almost unanimously . ]


Mr. SOUTHWELL offered a clause , importing , `` That all sailors who should take advance-money of the merchants , should be obliged to perform their agreements , or be liable to be taken up by any magistrate or justice of the peace , and deemed deserters , except they were in his majesty 's ships of war . ''


He was seconded by lord GAGE : -- Sir , as this clause has no other tendency than to promote the interest of the merchants , without obstructing the publick preparations  as it tends only to confirm legal contracts , and facilitate that commerce from whence the wealth and power of this nation arises , I hope it will readily be admitted  as we may , by adding this sanction to the contracts made between the merchants and sailors , in some degree balance the obstructions wherewith we have embarrassed trade by the other clauses .


Admiral WAGER replied : -- This clause is unquestionably reasonable , but not necessary  for it is to be found already in an act made for the encouragement of the merchants , which is still in force , and ought , whenever any such frauds are committed , to be rigorously observed .


Sir Robert WALPOLE then desired that the clerk might read the act , in which the clause was accordingly found , and Mr. SOUTHWELL withdrew his motion .


[ Then the question was put , whether the bill `` for the increase and encouragement of sailors '' do pass , which was resolved in the affirmative , 153 against 79 . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 13 , 1740-1 .


[ DEBATE ON THE BILL FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF MUTINY AND DESERTION . ]


The house being resolved into a committee for the consideration of the bill for the punishment of mutiny and desertion , and for the better payment of the army and their quarters , etc. sir William YONGE desired that the twentieth and twenty-sixth clauses of the late act might be read , which were read as follows :


XX .
It is hereby enacted , that the officers and soldiers , so quartered and billeted , shall be received by the owners of the inns , livery-stables , ale-houses , victualling-houses , and other houses in which they are allowed to be quartered and billeted by this act  and shall pay such reasonable prices as shall be appointed , from time to time , by the justices of the peace , in their general and quarter-sessions of each county , city , or division , within their respective jurisdictions : and the justices of the peace aforesaid , are hereby empowered and required to set and appoint , in their general or quarter-sessions aforesaid , such reasonable rates , for all necessary provisions for such officers and soldiers , for one or more nights , in the several cities , towns , villages and other places , which they shall come to in their march , or which shall be appointed for their residence and quarters .


XXVI .
That the quarters , both of officers and soldiers in Great Britain , may be duly paid and satisfied , be it enacted , that every officer , to whom it belongs to receive the pay or subsistence-money , either for a whole regiment , or particular troops and companies , shall immediately , upon each receipt of every particular sum , on account of pay or subsistence , give publick notice thereof to all persons keeping inns , or other places where officers or soldiers are quartered by virtue of this act : also appoint them and others to repair to their quarters , within four days at the farthest , after the receipt of the same , to declare the accounts or debts ( if any shall be ) between them and the officers and soldiers quartered in their respective houses : which accounts the said officer or officers are hereby required immediately to discharge , before any part of the said pay or subsistence be distributed to the officers or soldiers : provided the said accounts exceed not for a commission officer of horse , under a captain , for one day 's diet and small beer , two shillings  for one commission officer of dragoons , under a captain , one shilling  for one commission officer of foot , under a captain one shilling  and for hay and straw , for one horse , sixpence  for one dragoon or light horseman 's diet and small beer , each day sixpence , and hay and straw for his horse , sixpence  and also not to exceed fourpence a-day , for one foot soldier 's diet and small beer .


He then spoke to the following effect : -- Sir , whether there is any real difficulty in the clauses which you have now heard read , or whether there are such passages as may be easily understood by those who have no interest to mistake them , and which are only clouded by an artificial obscurity , whether they are in themselves capable of different meanings , or whether avarice or poverty have produced unreasonable interpretations , and found ambiguities only because they were determined not to be disappointed in their search  whether this law is disobeyed because it is misunderstood , or only misunderstood by those who have resolved to disobey it , the committee must determine .


It has been for many years understood that innholders and keepers of publick-houses were obliged by this law to supply soldiers quartered upon them with diet and small beer , and hay and straw for their horses , at such rates as are mentioned in the act  nor can I discover that these clauses admit of any other interpretation , or that any other could be intended by the senate by which it was enacted .
The pay of the soldiers , sir , was well known to those who gave their consent to this law , it was intended by them that the soldiers should be supplied with necessaries , and it could not be meant that they should pay for them more than they received  they , therefore , established the rate at which they were to be furnished , and fixed the highest rate which the wages of a soldier allow him to pay .


This interpretation was , as I suppose , from its apparent consonance to reason , universally allowed , till the inhabitants of Ledbury , whither soldiers had been sent to suppress a riot and enforce the laws , found their apprehensions so sharpened by their malice , that they discovered in the act an ambiguity , which had , till that time , escaped the penetration of the most sagacious , and , upon comparison of one circumstance with another , found themselves under no obligation to give any assistance to the soldiers .


They therefore , sir , not only refused to afford them victuals at the accustomed rates , but proceeding from one latitude of interpretation to another , at length denied them not only the privilege of diet , but the use of kitchen utensils , to dress the provisions which they bought for themselves , and at last denied their claim to the fire itself .


The soldiers , exasperated not only at the breach of their established and uncontested privileges , but at the privation of the necessaries of life , began to think of methods more speedy and efficacious than those of arguments and remonstrances , and to form resolutions of procuring by force , what , in their opinions , was only by force withheld from them .


What might have been the event of this controversy , to what extremities a contest about things so necessary might have been carried , how wide the contest might have spread , or how long it might have lasted , we may imagine , but can not determine  had not a speedy decision been procured , its consequences might have been fatal to multitudes , and a great part of the nation been thrown into confusion .


Having received an account of the affair from the officers who commanded at that place , I consulted the attorney-general what was the design of the law , and the extent of the obligation enforced by it , and was answered by him , that the sums which were to be paid for the diet of the men , and the hay and straw for the horses , being specified , it must necessarily be intended , by the legislature , that no higher rates should be demanded  -- that the power granted to the justices of peace was wholly in favour of the soldier , and that they might lessen the payment at discretion in places of uncommon cheapness , or years of extraordinary plenty , but could not increase it on any occasion .


Another dispute , sir , of the like nature was occasioned by the late scarcity at Wakefield , where the justices , upon the application of the innkeepers , made use of the authority which they supposed to have been reposed in them by the act , and raised the price of hay and straw to eight-pence , which the soldiers were not able to pay , without suffering for want of victuals .


On this occasion , likewise , I was applied to , and upon consulting the present attorney-general , received the same answer as before  and transmitting his opinion to the place from whence I received the complaint , it had so much regard paid to it , that the additional demand was thence-forward remitted .


The letters which those two learned lawyers sent to me on this subject I have now in my hand  and hope their opinion will be thought sufficient authority for the interpretation of an act of the senate .


Nor is their authority , sir , however great , so strong a proof of the justness of this interpretation , as the reasonableness , or rather necessity of admitting it .
The only argument that can be produced against it , is the hardship imposed by it on the innholder , who , as it is objected , must be obliged by the law , so understood , to furnish the soldiers with provisions for a price at which he can not afford them .


But let it be considered , how much more easily the landlord can furnish them at this price , than they can provide for themselves , and the difficulty will immediately vanish .
If soldiers are necessary , they must necessarily be supported , and it appears , upon reflection , that their pay will not support them by any other method .
If they are obliged to buy their victuals , they must likewise buy fire and implements to dress them  and what is still a greater hardship , they must sell them , and buy new , at every change of their quarters  if this is impossible , it will be allowed not to be the meaning of the senate , upon whose wisdom it would be a censure too severe to suppose them capable of enacting impossibilities .


But to the innholder , sir , whose utensils are always in use , and whose fire is always burning , the diet of a soldier costs only the original price paid to the butcher  and , in years of common plenty , may be afforded , without loss , at the price mentioned in the act .
It can not , indeed , be denied , that , at present , every soldier is a burden to the family on which he is quartered , in many parts of the kingdom  but , it may be reasonably hoped , that the present scarcity will quickly cease , and that provisions will fall back to their former value  and even , amidst all the complaints with which the severity and irregularity of the late seasons have filled the nation , there are many places where soldiers may be maintained at the stated rates , with very little hardship to their landlords .


However , sir , as this interpretation of the act , though thus supported , both by authority and reason , has been disputed and denied  as some lawyers may be of a different opinion from those whom I have consulted  and as it is not likely that the practice , thus interrupted , will now be complied with as a prescription  I think it necessary to propose , that the price of a soldier 's diet be more explicitly ascertained , that no room may remain for future controversies .


Mr. SANDYS then rose , and spoke as follows : -- Sir , I am very far from thinking the authority of these learned gentlemen , whose letters are produced , incontrovertible proof of the justness of an interpretation of an act of the senate , where that interpretation is not in itself warranted by reason , nor consistent with the preservation or enjoyment of property .
Much less shall I agree to support their interpretation by a new law  or establish , by an act of the legislature , a kind of oppression , for which , however tacitly submitted to , nothing could be pleaded hitherto but custom .


The burden , sir , of a standing army , is already too heavy to be much longer supported , nor ought we to add weight to it by new impositions  it surely much better becomes the representatives of the nation to attend to the complaints of their constituents  and where they are found to arise from real grievances , to contrive some expedient for alleviating their calamities .


A heavy and dreadful calamity , sir , lies now , in a particular manner , upon the people  the calamity of famine , one of the severest scourges of providence , has filled the whole land with misery and lamentation  and , surely , nothing can be more inhuman than to choose out this season of horrour for new encroachments on their privileges , and new invasions of the rights of nature , the dominion of their own houses , and the regulation of their own tables .


The honourable gentleman , sir , has mentioned places where provisions , as he says , are still to be bought at easy rates .
For my part , I am fixed in no such happy corner of the kingdom  I see nothing but scarcity , and hear nothing but complaints  and shall , therefore , be very far from admitting now such methods of supporting the army , as were thought too burdensome in times of plenty  nor will combine in laying a new tax upon any class of my countrymen , when they are sinking under an enormous load of imposts , and in want of the necessaries of life .


Sir William YONGE replied , in the manner following : -- Sir , nothing is more easy than outcry and exaggeration  nor any thing less useful for the discovery of truth , or the establishment of right .
The most necessary measures may often admit of very florid exclamations against them , and may furnish very fruitful topicks of invective .


When our liberties , sir , are endangered , or our country invaded , it may be very easy , when it is proposed that we should have recourse to our swords for security , to bewail , in pathetick language , the miseries of war , to describe the desolation of cities , the waste of kingdoms , the insolence of victory , and the cruelty of power inflamed by hostilities .
Yet to what will those representations contribute , but to make that difficult which yet can not be avoided , and embarrass measures which must , however , be pursued .


Such , sir , appear to me to be the objections made to the methods now proposed of providing necessaries for the soldiers  methods not eligible for their own sake , but which ought not to be too loudly condemned , till some better can be substituted  for why should the publick be alarmed with groundless apprehensions ?
or why should we make those laws which our affairs oblige us to enact , less agreeable to the people by partial representations ?


In the discussion of this question , sir , is to be considered whether soldiers are to be supported , and whether it will be more proper to maintain them by the method of ascertaining the rates at which they are to be supplied , or by increasing their pay .


One of these two ways it is necessary to take  the provisions are already fixed at as high a price as their pay will allow  if , therefore , they are expected to pay more , their wages must be increased .


For my part , I shall comply with either method  though I can not but think it my duty to declare , that , in my opinion , it is safer to fix the price of provisions , which must sink in their value , than to raise the pay of the army , which may never afterwards be reduced .


Mr. GYBBON then spoke , to this effect : -- Sir , I agree with the honourable gentleman , that if soldiers are necessary , we must make provision for their support .
This is indisputably certain  but it is no less certain , that where soldiers are necessary , restraints and regulations are necessary likewise , to preserve those from being insulted and plundered by them , who maintain them for the sake of protection .


The usefulness , sir , of this caution seems not to be known , or not regarded , by the gentleman whose proposal gave occasion to this debate  for , by enacting laws in general terms , as he seems to advise , we should leave the unhappy innkeeper wholly at the mercy of his guests , who might plunder and insult him under the protection of the legislature , might riot , as in a conquered country , and say , `` To this treatment you are subjected by the determination of the senate . ''


The unhappy man , sir , could have no prospect , either of quiet or safety , but by gratifying all the expectations of his masters  returning civilities for insolence , and receiving their commands with the same submission that is paid in capitulating towns to the new garrison .


If it be necessary to ascertain the price , is it not necessary , at the same time , to ascertain the species and quantity of provisions to be allowed for it ?
Is a soldier to fatten on delicacies , and to revel in superfluities , for fourpence a-day ?
Ought not some limits to be set to his expectations , and some restraints prescribed to his appetite ?
Is he to change his fare , with all the capriciousness of luxury , and relieve , by variety , the squeamishness of excess ?


Such demands as these , sir , may be thought ludicrous and trifling , by those who do not reflect on the insolence of slaves in authority , who do not consider that the license of a military life is the chief inducement that brings volunteers into the army  an inducement which would , indeed , make all impresses superfluous , were this proposal to be adopted : for how readily would all the lazy and voluptuous engage in a state of life which would qualify them to live upon the labour of others , and to be profuse without expense ?


Our army may , by this method , be increased  but the number of those by whom they are to be maintained , must quickly diminish : for , by exaction and oppression , the poorer innkeepers must quickly become bankrupts  and the soldiers that lose their quarters , must be added to the dividend allotted to the more wealthy , who , by this additional burden will soon be reduced to the same state , and then our army must subsist upon their pay , because they will no longer have it in their power to increase it by plunder .


It will then be inevitably necessary to divide the army from the rest of the community , and to build barracks for their reception  an expedient which , though it may afford present ease to the nation , can not be put in practice without danger to our liberties .


The reason , for which so many nations have been enslaved by standing armies , is nothing more than the difference of a soldier 's condition from that of other men .
Soldiers are governed by particular laws , and subject to particular authority  authority which , in the manner of its operation , has scarcely any resemblance of the civil power .
Thus , they soon learn to think themselves exempt from all other laws  of which they either do not discover the use , and , therefore , easily consent to abolish them  or envy the happiness of those who are protected by them , and so prevail upon themselves to destroy those privileges which have no other effect , with regard to them , but to aggravate their own dependence .


These , sir , are the natural consequences of a military subjection  and if these consequences are not always speedily produced by it , they must be retarded by that tenderness which constant intercourse with the rest of the nation produces , by the exchange of reciprocal acts of kindness , and by the frequent inculcation of the wickedness of contributing to the propagation of slavery , and the subversion of the rights of nature  inculcations which can not be avoided by men who live in constant fellowship with their countrymen .


But soldiers , shut up in a barrack , excluded from all conversation with such as are wiser and honester than themselves , and taught that nothing is a virtue but implicit obedience to the commands of their officer , will soon become foreigners in their own country , and march against the defenders of their constitution , with the same alacrity as against an army of invaders ravaging the coasts  they will lose all sense of social duty , and of social happiness , and think nothing illustrious but to enslave and destroy .


So fatal , sir , will be the effects of an establishment of barracks , or petty garrisons , in this kingdom  and , therefore , as barracks must be built when innkeepers are ruined , and our concurrence with this proposal must produce their ruin , I hope it-will not be necessary to prove by any other argument , that the motion ought to be rejected .


Mr. PELHAM spoke next , in terms to this purpose : -- Sir , though I am not inclined , by loud exaggerations and affected expressions of tenderness , to depress the courage or inflame the suspicions of the people , to teach them to complain of miseries which they do not feel , or ward against ill designs , which were never formed , yet no man is more really solicitous for their happiness , or more desirous of removing every real cause of fear and occasion of hardships .


This affection to the people , an affection steady , regular , and unshaken , has always prompted me to prefer their real to their seeming interest , and rather to consult the security of their privileges than the gratification of their passions  it has hitherto determined me to vote for such a body of troops , as may defend us against sudden inroads and wanton insults , and now incites me to propose that some efficacious method may be struck out for their support , without exasperating either the soldiers or their landlords by perpetual wrangles , or adding to the burden of a military establishment the necessity of contentions in courts of law .


I know not with what view those have spoken , by whom the proposal first made has been opposed  they have , indeed , produced objections , some of which are such as may be easily removed , and others such as arise from the nature of things , and ought not , therefore , to be mentioned , because they have no other tendency than to inflame the minds of those that hear them against an army , at a time when it is allowed to be necessary , and prove only what was never denied , that no human measures are absolutely perfect , and that it is often impossible to avoid a greater evil , but by suffering a less .


The question before us , sir , is in its own nature so simple , so little connected with circumstances that may distract our attention , or induce different men to different considerations , that when I reflect upon it , I can not easily conceive by what art it can be made the subject of long harangues , or how the most fruitful imagination can expatiate upon it .


It is already admitted that an army is necessary  the pay of that army is already established  the accidental scarcity of forage and victuals is such , that the pay is not sufficient to maintain them  how then must the deficiency be supplied ?
It has been proposed , either to fix the price of provisions with respect to them , or to advance their wages in some proportion to the price of provisions .
Both these methods seem to meet with disapprobation , and yet the army is to be supported .


Those who reason thus , do surely not expect to be answered , or at least expect from a reply no other satisfaction than that of seeing the time of the session wasted , and the administration harassed with trivial delays  for what can be urged with any hope of success to him who will openly deny contradictory propositions , who will neither move nor stand still , who will neither disband an army nor support it ?


Whether these gentlemen conceive that an army may subsist without victuals till the time of scarcity is over , or whether they have raised those forces only to starve them , I am not sagacious enough to conjecture , but shall venture to observe , that if they have such a confidence in the moderation and regularity of the soldiers , as to imagine that they will starve with weapons in their hands , that they will live within the sight of full tables , and languish with hunger , and perish for want of necessaries , rather than diminish the superfluities of others , they ought for ever to cease their outcries about the licentiousness , insolence , and danger of a standing army .


But , not to sink into levity unworthy of this assembly , may I be permitted to hint that these arts of protracting our debates , are by no means consistent with the reasons for which we are assembled , and that it is a much better proof , both of ability and integrity , to remove objections , than to raise them , and to facilitate , than to retard , the business of the publick .


The proposal made at first was only to elucidate a law which had been regularly observed for fifty years , and to remove such ambiguities as tended only to embarrass the innholders , not to relieve them .


To this many objections have been made , and much declamation has been employed to display the hardships of maintaining soldiers , but no better method has been yet discovered , nor do I expect that any will be started not attended with greater difficulties .


In all political questions , questions too extensive to be fully comprehended by speculative reason , experience is the guide which a wise man will follow with the least distrust , and it is no trivial recommendation of the present method , that it has been so long pursued without any formidable inconvenience or loud complaints .


Hardships , even when real , are alleviated by long custom  we bear any present uneasiness with less regret , as we less remember the time in which we were more happy : at least , by long acquaintance with any grievance we gain this advantage , that we know it in its whole extent , that it can not be aggravated by our imagination , and that there is no room for suspecting that any misery is yet behind more heavy than that which we have already borne .


Such is the present state of the practice now recommended to this assembly , a practice to which the innkeepers have long submitted , and found it at least tolerable , to which they knew themselves exposed when they took out a license for the exercise of that profession , and which they consider as a tax upon them , to be balanced against the advantages which they expect from their employment .


This tax can not be denied at present to be burdensome in a very uncommon degree , but this weight has not been of long continuance , and it may be reasonably hoped that it will now be made every day lighter .
It is , indeed , true , that no unnecessary impositions ought to be laid upon the nation even for a day  and if any gentleman can propose a method by which this may be taken off or alleviated , I shall readily comply with his proposal , and concur in the establishment of new regulations .


With regard to barracks , I can not deny that they are justly names of terrour to a free nation , that they tend to make an army seem part of our constitution , and may contribute to infuse into the soldiers a disregard of their fellow-subjects , and an indifference about the liberties of their country  but I can not discover any connexion between a provision for the support of soldiers in publick-houses , in a state of constant familiarity with their countrymen , and the erection of barracks , by which they will be , perhaps for ever , separated from them , nor can discover any thing in the method of supporting them now recommended that does not tend rather to the promotion of mutual good offices , and the confirmation of friendship and benevolence .


The advocate CAMPBELL next spoke , in substance as follows : -- Sir , whence the impropriety of raising objections to any measures that are proposed is imagined to arise I am unable to discover , having hitherto admitted as an incontrovertible opinion , that it is the duty of every member of this assembly to deliver , without reserve , his sentiments upon any question which is brought before him , and to approve or censure , according to his conviction .


If it be his duty , sir , to condemn what he thinks dangerous or inconvenient , it seems by no means contrary to his duty , to show the reason of his censure , or to lay before the house those objections which he can not surmount by his own reflection .
It certainly is not necessary to admit implicitly all that is asserted  and to deny , or disapprove without reason , can he no proof of duty , or of wisdom  and how shall it be known , that he who produces no objections , acts from any other motives , than private malevolence , discontent , or caprice ?


Nor is it , sir , to be imputed as a just reason for censure to those who have opposed the motion , that no other measures have been offered by them to the consideration of the committee .
It is necessary to demolish a useless or shattered edifice , before a firm and habitable building can be erected in its place : the first step to the amendment of a law is to show its defects  for why should any alteration be made where no inconveniency is discovered ?


To the chief objection that was offered , no answer has yet been made , nor has the assembly been informed how the innkeeper shall be able to discover when he has paid the tax which this law lays upon him .
This is , indeed , a tax of a very particular kind , a tax without limits , and to be levied at the discretion of him for whose benefit it is paid .
Soldiers quartered upon these terms , are more properly raising contributions in an enemy 's country , than receiving wages in their own .


Is it intended , by this motion , that the innkeepers shall judge what ought to be allowed the soldier for his money ?
I do not see , then , that any alteration is proposed in the present condition of our army  for who has ever refused to sell them food for their money at the common price , or what necessity is there for a law to enforce a practice equally to the advantage of all parties ?
If it be proposed that the soldier shall judge for himself , that he shall set what value he shall think fit on his own money , and that he shall be at once the interpreter and executioner of this new law , the condition of the innkeeper will then be such as no slave in the mines of America can envy , and such as he will gladly quit for better treatment under the most arbitrary and oppressive government .


Nor will the insolence of the soldier , thus invested with unlimited authority , thus entitled to implicit obedience , and exalted above the rest of mankind , by seeing his claim only bounded by his own moderation , be confined to his unhappy landlord .
Every guest will become subject to his intrusion , and the passenger must be content to want his dinner , whenever the lord of the inn shall like it better than his own .


That these apprehensions , sir , are not groundless , may be proved from the conduct of these men , even when the law was not so favourable to their designs  some of them have already claimed the sole dominion of the houses in which they have been quartered , and insulted persons of very high rank , and whom our ancient laws had intended to set above the insults of a turbulent soldier .
They have seen the provisions which they had ordered taken away by force , partly , perhaps , to please the appetite of the invader , and partly to gratify his insolence , and give him an opportunity of boasting among his comrades , how successfully he blustered .


If it be necessary , sir , to insert a new clause in the act to prevent lawsuits , which , however advantageous they may sometimes be to me , I shall always be ready to obviate , it is surely proper to limit the claim of one party as well as that of the other , for how else is the ambiguity taken away ?
The difficulty may be , indeed , transferred , but is by no means removed , and the innkeeper must wholly repose himself upon the lenity and justice of the soldier , or apply to the courts of law for the interpretation of the act .


The question before us is said to be so free from perplexity , that it can scarcely give occasion for harangues or disputations  and , indeed , it can not but be allowed , that the controversy may soon be brought to a single point , and I think nothing more is necessary than to inquire , if innholders shall be obliged to provide victuals for soldiers at a stated price , what , and how much the soldier shall demand .


The power of raising money at pleasure , has been hitherto denied to our kings , and surely we ought not to place that confidence in the lowest , that has been refused to the most exalted of mankind , or invest our soldiers with power , which neither the most warlike of our monarchs could constrain us , nor the most popular allure us to grant .


The power now proposed to be granted , is nothing less than the power of levying money , or what is exactly equivalent , the power of raising the money in their own hands , to any imaginary value .
A soldier may , if this motion be complied with , demand for a penny , what another man must purchase at forty times that price .
While this is the state of our property , it is surely not very necessary to raise armies for the defence of it  for why should we preserve it from one enemy only to throw it into the hands of another , equally rapacious , equally merciless , and only distinguished from foreign invaders by this circumstance , that he received from our own hands the authority by which he plunders us .


Having thus evinced the necessity of determining the soldier 's privileges , and the innkeeper 's rights , I think it necessary to recommend to this assembly an uncommon degree of attention to the regulation of our military establishment , which is become not only more burdensome to our fellow-subjects by the present famine , but by the increase of our forces  an increase which the nation will not behold without impatience , unless they be enabled to discern for what end they have been raised .


The people of this nation are , for very just reasons , displeased , even with the appearance of a standing army , and surely it is not prudent to exasperate them , by augmenting the troops in a year of famine , and giving them , at the same time , new powers of extortion and oppression .


Mr. WINNINGTON spoke to this purpose : -- Sir , I have heard nothing in this debate , but doubts and objections , which afford no real information , nor tend to the alleviation of those grievances , which are so loudly lamented .


It is not sufficient to point out inconveniencies , or to give striking representations of the hardships to which the people are exposed  for unless some better expedient can be proposed , or some method discovered by which we may receive the benefits , without suffering the disadvantages of the present practice , how does it appear that these hardships , however severe , are not inseparable from our present condition , and such as can only be removed by exposing ourselves to more formidable evils ?


As no remedy , sir , has been proposed by those who appear dissatisfied with the present custom , it is reasonable to imagine that none will be easily discovered  and , therefore , I can not but think it reasonable that the motion should be complied with .
By it no new imposition is intended , nor any thing more than the establishment of a practice which has continued for more than fifty years , and never , except on two occasions , been denied to be legal .
It is only proposed that the senate should confirm that interpretation of the act which has been almost universally received  that they should do what can produce no disturbance , because it will make no alterations  but may prevent them , because it may prevent any attempts of innovation , or diversity of opinions .


Sir John BARNARD spoke next , to the following effect : -- Sir , whether the interpretation of the act which is now contended for , has been universally admitted , it is impossible to know  but it is at least certain , that the practice which is founded upon it , has in many places never been followed , nor , indeed , can it be made general without great impropriety .


Many of those , sir , who are styled keepers of publick-houses , and on whom soldiers are quartered under that denomination , have no conveniency of furnishing provisions , because they never sell them  such are many of the keepers of livery stables , among whom it is the common method to pay soldiers a small weekly allowance , instead of lodging them in their houses , a lodging being all which they conceive themselves obliged to provide , and all that the soldiers have hitherto required  nor can we make any alteration in this method without introducing the license and insolence of soldiers into private houses  into houses hitherto unacquainted with any degree of riot , incivility , or uproar .


The reason for which publick-houses are assigned for the quarters of soldiers , is partly the greater conveniency of accommodating them in families that subsist , by the entertainment of strangers , and partly the nature of their profession , which , by exposing them to frequent encounters with the rude and the debauched , enables them either to bear or repress the insolence of a soldier .


But with regard , sir , to the persons whom I have mentioned , neither of these reasons have any place  they have not , from their daily employment , any opportunities of furnishing soldiery with beds or victuals , nor , by their manner of life , are adapted to support intrusion or struggle with perverseness .
Nor can I discover why any man should force soldiers into their houses , who would not willingly admit them into his own .


Mr. COCKS spoke to this effect : -- Sir , the practice mentioned by the honourable gentleman , I know to be generally followed by all those that keep alehouses in the suburbs of this metropolis , who pay the soldiers billeted on them a composition for their lodging , nor ever see them but when they come to receive it  so far are they from imagining that they can claim their whole subsistence at any stated price .


It is apparent , therefore , that by admitting this motion , we should not confirm a law already received , but establish a new regulation unknown to the people  that we should lay a tax upon the nation , and send our soldiers to collect it .


General WADE rose , and spoke to this purpose : -- Sir , I have been long conversant with military affairs  and , therefore , may perhaps be able to give a more exact account , from my own knowledge , of the antiquity and extent of this practice , than other gentlemen have had , from their way of life  an opportunity of obtaining .


It was , sir , in the reign of king William , the constant method by which the army was supported , as may be easily imagined by those who reflect , that it was common for the soldiers to remain for eight or ten months unpaid , and that they had , therefore , no possibility of providing for themselves the necessaries of life .
Their pay never was received in those times by themselves , but issued in exchequer bills for large sums , which the innkeepers procured to be exchanged and divided among themselves , in proportion to their debts .


Such was the practice , sir , in that reign , which has been generally followed to this time , and the rates then fixed have not since been changed  and as no inconveniency has arisen from this method , I can discover no reason against confirming and continuing it .


Mr. PULTKNEY spoke next , in the manner following : -- Sir , those that have spoken in defence of the motion , have accused their opponents , with great confidence , of declaiming without arguments , and of wasting the time of the session in a useless repetition of objections .
I do not , indeed , wonder that the objections which have been raised should have given some disgust , for who can be pleased with hearing his opponent produce arguments which he can not answer ?
But surely the repetitions may be excused  for an objection is to be urged in every debate till it is answered , or is discovered to be unanswerable .


But what , sir , have those urged in defence of their own opinions , who so freely animadvert upon the reasonings of others ?
What proofs , sir , have they given of the superiority of their own abilities , of the depth of their researches , or the acuteness of their penetration ?


They have not produced one argument in favour of their motion , but that it is founded on custom  they have not discovered , however wise and sagacious , that it is always necessary to inquire whether a custom be good or bad  for surely without such inquiry no custom ought to be confirmed .
The motion which they would support , is , indeed , useless in either case , for a good custom will continue of itself , and one that is bad ought not to be continued .
It is the business of the legislature to reform abuses , and eradicate corruptions , not to give them new strength by the sanction of a law .


It has been urged , sir , that the law in reality exists already in that the act has been interpreted in this sense by the attorney general  and that his interpretation is generally received .
This is then the state of the question : if the practice , founded upon this sense of the act , generally prevails , there is no need of a new clause to enforce what is already complied with  if it does not prevail , all that has been urged in defence of the motion falls to the ground .


I do not doubt , sir , that this custom has been received without many exceptions , and therefore think it ought still to remain a custom , rather than be changed into a law  because it will be complied with as a custom , where there are no obstacles to the observation of it  and it ought not to be enforced by law , where it is inconvenient and oppressive .


While the soldier , sir , is moderate in his demands , and peaceable and modest in his behaviour , the innkeeper will cheerfully furnish him even more than he can afford at the stated price  and certainly , rudeness , insolence , and unreasonable expectations , may justly be punished by the forfeiture of some conveniencies .
Thus , sir , the innkeeper will preserve some degree of authority in his own house , a place where the laws of nature give every man dominion , and the soldier will continue a regular and inoffensive member of civil society .


The absurdity of leaving the soldier at large in his demands , and limiting the price which the innkeeper is to require , has been already exposed beyond the possibility of reply  nor , indeed , has the least attempt been made to invalidate this objection  for it has been passed in silence by those who have most zealously espoused the motion .
The account given by the honourable gentleman of the reason for which this regulation was first introduced in the reign of king William , is undoubtedly just  but it proves , sir , that there is no necessity of continuing it  for the soldiers are now constantly paid , and therefore need not that assistance from the innkeeper , which was absolutely requisite when they were sometimes six months without money .


It has been urged , sir , with great importunity and vehemence , that some expedient should be proposed in the place of this , which so many gentlemen who have spoken on this occasion seem inclined to reject , and which , indeed , can not be mentioned without contempt or abhorrence .
That the soldiers should know , as well as their landlord , their own rights , is undoubtedly just , as well as that they should have some certain means of procuring the necessaries of life  it may , therefore , be proper to enact , that the innkeeper shall either furnish them with diet at the established rates , or permit them to dress the victuals which they shall buy for themselves , with his fire and utensils , and allow them candles , salt , vinegar , and pepper .
By this method the soldiers can never be much injured by the incivility of their landlord , nor can the innkeeper be subjected to arbitrary demands .
The soldier will still gain , by decency and humanity , greater conveniencies than he can procure for himself by his pay alone , and all opportunities of oppression on either side will , in a great measure , be taken away .


I can not but express my hopes that this method will be generally approved .
Those that have opposed the establishment of an army will be pleased to see it made less grievous to the people  and those that have declared in its favour , ought surely to adopt , without opposition , any measures , by the pursuit of which it may be borne with fewer complaints , and less reluctance .


[ The consideration of this question was deferred , and the chairman having moved for leave to sit again , it was resolved to proceed on this business upon the next day but one , in a committee of the whole house . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 15 , 1740-1 .


The order of the day being read for the house to resolve itself into a committee of the whole house , to consider the bill for punishing mutiny and desertion , and the better paying the army and their quarters ,


Sir William YONGE spoke , in substance as follows : -- Sir , the last day which was assigned to the consideration of this bill , was spent in long altercations , in vague and unnecessary disquisitions , in retrospective reflections upon events long past , and in aggravating of grievances that may never happen  much sagacity was exerted , and much eloquence displayed , but no determination was attained , nor even that expedient examined , by which those objections might be removed which appeared so important , or those dangers obviated which were represented so formidable and so near .


I hope , sir , part of the time which has intervened between that debate and the present day , has been employed by the gentlemen , whose scruples were so numerous , and whose caution is so vigilant , in contriving some methods of maintaining the army without oppressing the victuallers , and of providing for our defence against foreign enemies without subjecting us to the evils of discontent and disaffection , which they impute to the present state of the military establishment .


To object for ever , and to advance nothing , is an easy method of disputation upon any question , but contributes very little to the increase of knowledge : an artful and acute objector may confound , and darken , and disturb , but never assists inquiry , or illustrates truth .


In political questions , sir , it is still more easy and less ingenuous  for all political measures are in some degree right and wrong at the same time : to benefit some they very frequently bear hard upon others , and are , therefore , only to be approved or rejected as advantages appear to overbalance the inconveniencies , or the inconveniencies to outweigh the advantages .


It is , sir , the proper province of a senator to promote , not to obstruct the publick counsels  and when he declares his disapprobation of any expedient , to endeavour to substitute a better : for how can he be said to sustain his part of the general burden of publick affairs , who lays others under the necessity of forming every plan , and inventing every expedient , and contents himself with only censuring what he never endeavours to amend ?


That every man , who is called forth by his country to sit here as the guardian of the publick happiness , is obliged , by the nature of his office , to propose , in this assembly , whatever his penetration or experience may suggest to him as advantageous to the nation , I doubt not but all that hear me are sufficiently convinced  and , therefore , can not but suppose that they have so far attended to their duty , as to be able to inform us how the present inconveniencies of this bill may be remedied , and its defects supplied .


To show , sir , at least my inclination to expedite an affair so important , I shall lay before the house an amendment that I have made to the clause , pursuant to a hint offered the last day by an honourable member , `` That all innholders , victuallers , etc. shall be obliged to furnish soldiers with salt , vinegar , small beer , candles , fire , and utensils to dress their victuals , and so doing shall not be obliged to supply the troops with provisions , except on a march . ''


I am far , sir , from thinking the clause , as it will stand after this amendment , complete and unexceptionable , being conscious that some articles in it may require explanation .
The quantity of small beer to be allowed to each soldier must necessarily be ascertained , in order to prevent endless and indeterminable disputes  for one man , sir , may demand a greater quantity than another , and a man may be prompted by malice or wantonness to demand more than health requires  it will , therefore , be proper to limit the quantity which must be furnished , that neither the soldier may suffer by the avarice of his landlord , nor the landlord be oppressed by the gluttony of the soldier .


With regard to this question , sir , I expect to find different opinions in this assembly , which every man is at liberty to offer and to vindicate  and I shall take this opportunity of proposing on my part , that every man may have a daily allowance of three quarts .
One quart to each meal may be allowed in my opinion to be sufficient , and sure no gentleman can imagine that by this limitation much superfluity is indulged .


There are some parts , sir , of this kingdom , in which cider is more plentiful , and cheaper than small beer  consequently , it may be for the ease of the victualler to have the choice allowed him of furnishing one or the other  it will , therefore , be a very proper addition to this clause , that the innkeepers shall allow the soldier , every day , three quarts of either small beer or cider .


That penal sanctions , sir , are essential to laws , and that no man will submit to any regulations inconvenient to himself , but that he may avoid some heavier evil , requires not to be proved  and , therefore , to complete this clause , I propose that the victualler who shall neglect or refuse to observe it , shall be subject to some fine for his non-compliance .


Mr. PELHAM spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I can not omit this opportunity of observing how much the burden of the army is diminished by the judicious regulations invariably observed in the late reigns , and how little the assignment of troops is to be dreaded by the victualler .


In the reign of king William , sir , before funds were established , while the credit of the government was low , the measures of the court were often obviated or defeated by the superiority of the discontented party , and the supplies denied which were necessary to support them , and in expectation of which they had been undertaken , it was not uncommon for the towns in which the troops were stationed , to murmur at their guests  nor could they be charged with complaining without just reasons : for to quarter soldiers upon a house , was in those days little less than to send troops to live at discretion .


As all supplies , sir , were then occasional and temporary , and nothing was granted but for the present exigence , the prevalence of the opposition , for a single session , embarrassed all the measures of the court in the highest degree  their designs were at a stand , the forces were unpaid , and they were obliged to wait till another session for an opportunity of prosecuting their schemes .


Thus , sir , the soldiers were sometimes five months without their pay , and were necessarily supported by the innkeeper at his own expense , with how much reluctance and discontent I need not mention .
It can not but be immediately considered , upon hearing this account of the soldier 's condition , with how many reproaches he would receive his victuals , how roughly he would be treated , how often he would be insulted as an idler , and frowned upon as an intruder .
Nor can it be imagined that such affronts , however they might be provoked , would be borne without return , by those who knew themselves not the authors of the provocation , and who thought themselves equal suf-ferers with those who complained .
When the innkeeper growled at the soldier , the soldier , it may be supposed , seldom failed to threaten or to plunder the innkeeper , and to rise in his demands as his allowance was retrenched .


Thus , sir , the landlord and his guest were the constant enemies of each other , and spent their lives in mutual complaints , injuries , and insults .


But by the present regularity of our military establishment , this great evil is taken away  as the soldier requires no credit of the victualler , he is considered as no great incumbrance on his trade  and being treated without indignities , like any other member of the community , he inhabits his quarters without violence , insolence , or rapacity , and endeavours to recommend himself by officiousness and civility .


In the present method of payment , sir , the troops have always one month 's pay advanced , and receive their regular allowance on the stated day  so that every man has it in his power to pay his landlord every night for what he has had in the day  or if he imagines himself able to procure his own provisions at more advantage , he can now go to market with his own money .


It appears , therefore , to me , sir , that the amendment now proposed is the proper mean between the different interests of the innkeeper and soldier  by which neither is made the slave of the other , and by which we shall leave , to both , opportunities of kindness , but take from them the power of oppression .


Mr. CAREW next spoke as follows : -- Sir , the amendment now offered is not , in my opinion , so unreasonable or unequitable as to demand a warm and strenuous opposition , nor so complete as not to be subject to some objections  objections which , however , may be easily removed , and which would , perhaps , have been obviated , had they been foreseen by the gentleman who proposed it .


The allowance , sir , of small liquors proposed , I can not but think more than sufficient  three quarts a-day are surely more than the demands of nature make necessary , and I know not why the legislature should promote , or confirm in the soldiery , a vice to which they are already too much inclined , the habit of tippling .


The innkeeper , sir , will be heavily burdened by the obligation to supply the soldier with so many of the necessaries of life without payment  and , therefore , it may be justly expected by him , that no superfluities should be enjoyed at his expense .


But there remains another objection , sir , of far more importance , and which must be removed before this clause can be reasonably passed into a law .
It is not declared , or not with sufficient perspicuity , that it is to be left to the choice of the innkeeper , whether he will furnish the soldier with provisions at fourpence a-day , or with the necessaries enumerated in the clause for nothing .
If it is to be left to the choice of the soldier , the victualler receives no relief from the amendment , to whose option , since he must suffer in either case , it ought to be referred , because he only can tell by which method he shall suffer least .


Mr. CORNWALL spoke in the manner following : -- Sir , it is not without the greatest diffidence that I rise to oppose the gentleman who offered the amendment  for his abilities are so far superiour to mine , that I object without hope of being able to support my objection , and contend with an absolute certainty of being overcome .
I know not whether it may be allowed me to observe , that the difference between our faculties is , with regard to strength and quickness , the same as between the cider of his county and that of mine , except that in one part of the parallel the advantage is on our side , and in the other on his .


The cider , sir , of our county is one of our most valuable commodities  so much esteemed in distant places , that our merchants often sell it by the bottle , for more than the soldier has to give for the provision of a day  and of such strength , that I , who am accustomed to the use of it , never was able to drink three quarts in any single day .


If , therefore , sir , the soldier is to have three quarts of this cider , when small beer is not easily to be procured , not only the innkeeper , but the army will be injured  for what greater harm can be done to any man , than to initiate him in a habit of intemperance ?
and what outrages and insolencies may not be expected from men trusted with swords , and kept , from day to day , and from month to month , in habitual drunkenness by a decree of the senate ?


Sir William YONGE replied to this purpose : -- Sir , I know not why the gentleman has thought this a proper opportunity for displaying his eloquence in the praise of his own cider .
That he loves his own county can not be wondered , for no passion is more universal , and few less to be censured  - but he is not to imagine that the produce of his native soil will be generally allowed to excel that of other counties , because early habits have endeared it to him , and familiarized it to his particular palate .


The natives of every place prefer their own fruits and their own liquor , and , therefore , no inference can be drawn from approbation so apparently partial .
From this prejudice I am far from suspecting myself free , nor am desirous or industrious to overcome it : neither am I afraid of exposing myself to all the censure that so innocent a prepossession may bring upon me , by declaring that , in my opinion , the cider of my native county is of equal excellence with that which this gentleman has so liberally extolled .


Mr. CORNWALL answered to the following effect : -- Sir , how little I expect victory in this controversy I have already declared , and I need not observe of how small importance it is what soil produces cider of the greatest excellence and value  since , if there be other places where the cider is equally esteemed , and purchased at the same rate , it is yet more necessary to provide , by some exception , that the soldier shall not be entitled to demand , of the victualler , liquor to more than thrice the value of his pay , nor be allowed to revel in continual drunkenness , and to corrupt his morals , and enervate his limbs by incessant debauchery .


But since , sir , the preference due to the cider of my county has been denied , in my opinion , with great partiality and injustice , I think myself obliged , by all the laws of honour and gratitude , to stand up once more to vindicate its superiority , and assert its value .


The laws of honour , sir , require this from me , as they oblige every man to stand forth a vindicator of merit slighted and oppressed  and gratitude calls loudly upon me to exert myself in the protection of that to which I have been often indebted for a pleasing suspense of care , and a welcome flow of spirit and gaiety .


The cider , sir , which I am now rescuing from contemptuous comparisons , has often exhilarated my social hours , enlivened the freedom of conversation , and improved the tenderness of friendship , and shall not , therefore , now want a panegyrist .
It is one of those few subjects on which an encomiast may expatiate without deviating from the truth .


Would the honourable gentleman , sir , who has thus vilified this wonder-working nectar , but honour my table with his company , he would quickly be forced to retract his censures  and , as many of his countrymen have done , confess that nothing equal to it is produced in any other part of the globe  nor will this confession be the effect of his regard to politeness , but of his adherence to truth .


Of liquor like this , sir , two quarts is , undoubtedly , sufficient for a daily allowance , in the lieu of small beer  nor ought even that to be determined by the choice of the soldier , but of the innkeeper , for whose benefit this clause is said to be inserted , and from whose grievances I hope we shall not suffer our attention to be diverted by any incidental questions , or ludicrous disputes .


Mr. GORE then spoke to the following effect : -- Sir , that the allowance of two quarts a-day is sufficient , and that to demand more is a wanton indulgence of appetite , is experimentally known , and , therefore , no more ought to be imposed upon the innkeeper .


Nor is this , sir , the only part of the clause that requires our consideration  for some of the other particulars to be provided by the victualler , may easily furnish perverse tempers with an opportunity of wrangling : vinegar is not to be had in every part , of the kingdom , and , where it can not be procured , ought not to be required  for neither reason nor experience will inform us that vinegar ought to be ranked among the necessaries of life .


Sir William YONGE made the following reply : -- Sir , by the alteration now made in the clause , the innkeepers are effectually relieved from a great part of the burden which , in my opinion , this act has hitherto laid upon them  the necessity of furnishing the soldiers quartered upon them , with provisions at the stated price , whatever might be the scarcity of the season or of the country .
That this was the intention of the act , is asserted by those whose reputation and promotion are sufficient evidences of their ability in the interpretation of our laws .


The innkeeper may now either accept or refuse the limited price , as it shall appear to him most consistent with his interest  nor will there be , for the future , any room for murmuring at unreasonable demands , since he may oblige that soldier whom he can not satisfy , to please himself better at his own expense .


The choice of the liquor is , likewise , wholly referred to the innkeeper  for the words in the clause requiring that he shall furnish three quarts of small beer or cider , he complies , indisputably , with the law by supplying either  and , therefore , the value of cider in any particular county is not of much importance in the question before us  if cider be more valuable than small beer , it may be withheld  if it be cheaper , it may be substituted in its place  so that the innkeeper has nothing to consult but his own interest .


That this is the meaning of the clause , is , I suppose , obvious to every man that hears it read  and , therefore , I see no reason for any alterations , because I know not any effect which they can possibly have , except that of obscuring the sense which is now too clear to be mistaken .


Sir John BARNARD spoke next , to the effect following : -- Sir , though it should be granted , that the clause before us is intelligible to every member of this assembly , it will not certainly follow , that there is no necessity of farther elucidations  for a law very easily understood by those who make it , may be obscure to others who are less acquainted with our general intention , less skilled in the niceties of language , or less accustomed to the style of laws .


It is to be considered , that this law will chiefly affect a class of men very little instructed in literature , and very unable to draw inferences  men to whom we often find it necessary , in common cases , to use long explanations , and familiar illustrations , and of whom it maybe not unreasonably suspected , that the same want of education , which makes them ignorant , may make them petulant , and at once incline them to wrangle , and deprive them of the means of deciding their controversies .


That both innholders and soldiers are , for the greatest part , of this rank and temper , I suppose , sir , every gentleman knows , from daily observation  and , therefore , it will , I hope , be thought necessary to descend to their understandings , and to give them laws in terms of which they will know the meaning  we shall , otherwise , more consult the interest of the lawyers than the innholders , and only , by one alteration , produce a necessity of another .


I am therefore desirous , sir , that all the difficulties which have been mentioned by every gentleman on this occasion , should be removed by clear , familiar , and determinate expressions  for what they have found difficult , may easily be , to an innholder or soldier , absolutely inexplicable .


I can not but declare , while I am speaking on this subject , that in my opinion , two quarts of liquor will be a sufficient allowance .
If we consider the demands of nature , more can not be required  if we examine the expense of the innholder , he ought not to supply soldiers with a greater quantity for nothing .
It is to be remembered , that small beer , like other liquors , is charged with an excise in publick-houses  and that two quarts will probably cost the landlord a penny , and as we can not suppose that fire , candles , vinegar , salt , pepper , and the use of utensils , and lodging , can be furnished for less than threepence a-day , every soldier that is quartered upon a publick-house , may be considered as a tax of six pounds a-year -- a heavy burden , which surely ought not to be aggravated by unnecessary impositions .


[ The committee having gone through the bill , and settled the amendments , the chairman was ordered to make his report the next day . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 16 , 1740-1 .


The report was read , and the amendments to the clauses in debate , which then ran thus : --


That the officers and soldiers to be quartered and billeted as aforesaid , shall be received , and furnished with diet and small beer by the owners of the inns , livery stables , alehouses , victualling-houses , etc. paying and allowing for the same the several rates mentioned .


Provided , that in case the innholder on whom any non-commission officers or soldiers shall be quartered , by virtue of this act , ( except on a march , ) shall be desirous to furnish such officers or soldiers with candles , vinegar , and salt , and with either small beer or cider , not ex-ceeding three quarts for each man a-day gratis , and to allow them the use of fire , and the necessary utensils for dressing and eating their meat , and shall give notice of such his desire to the commanding officers , and shall furnish and allow them the same accordingly  then , and in such case , the non-commission officers and soldiers so quartered shall provide their own victuals  and the officer to whom it belongs to receive , or that does actually receive the pay and subsistence of such non-commission officers and soldiers , shall pay the several sums , payable out of the subsistence-money for diet and small beer , to the non-commission officers and soldiers aforesaid , and not to the innholder or other person on whom such non-commission officers or soldiers are quartered .


The question being put whether this clause should stand thus ,


Mr. CAREW spoke to this effect : -- Sir , though it may , perhaps , be allowed , that the circumstances of our present situation oblige us to support a more numerous army than in former years , surely no argument can be drawn from them that can show the necessity of a profuse allowance to our soldiers , or of gratifying their desires by the oppression of the innholders .


If , sir , the designs of our enemies are so malicious , and their power so formidable , as to demand augmentations of our troops , and additions to our natural securities , they ought , surely , to impress upon us the necessity of frugal measures , that no useless burdens may be imposed upon the people .


To furnish two quarts of beer , sir , every day for nothing , is , undoubtedly , an imposition sufficiently grievous  and I can , therefore , discover no reason for which an allowance of three should be established  a proposal injurious to the victualler , because it exacts more than he can afford to allow , and of no benefit to the soldier , because it offers him more than he can want .


Sir William YONGE spoke next , to this purpose : -- Sir , if it is an instance of misconduct to spend upon any affair more time than the importance of it deserves , I am afraid that the clause , to which our attention is now recalled , may expose us to censure , and that we may be charged with neglecting weighty controversies , and national questions , to debate upon trifles  of wasting our spirits upon subjects unworthy of contention  of defeating the expectations of the publick , and diverting our enemies rather than opposing them .


But , sir , as nothing has a more immediate tendency to the security of the nation than a proper establishment of our forces , and the regulation of their quarters is one of the most necessary and difficult parts of the establishment  it is requisite that we think no question of this kind too trivial for our consideration , since very dangerous disturbances have often been produced by petty disputes .


The quantity , sir , of small beer to be allowed by the victualler to those soldiers who shall provide their own victuals , was disputed yesterday , and , as I thought , agreed upon  but since this question is revived , I must take the opportunity to declare , that we ought not to assign less than three quarts a-day to each man  for it is to be remembered by those who estimate the demands by their own , how much their way of life is different from that of a common soldier , and how little he can be charged with wantonness and superfluity , for drinking more small liquor than themselves .


There are few members of this house , who do not , more than once a-day , drink tea , coffee , chocolate , or some other cooling and diluting infusion  delicacies which the soldier can not purchase  to which he is entirely a stranger , and of which the place must be supplied by some other cheap and wholesome liquors .


If , sir , those gentlemen whose close attention to the interest of the innholder has , perhaps , abstracted them , in some degree , from any regard to the necessities of a soldier , will consent to allow him five pints a-day , I shall contend no longer  for though I can not agree that it is a sufficient provision , yet , as other gentlemen , equally able to judge in this subject with myself , are of a different opinion , I shall show my regard for their sentiments by desisting from opposition .


Lord BALTIMORE spoke in substance as follows : -- Sir , I am not able to discover any necessity of compromising this debate , by taking the mean between the two different opinions , or for denying to the soldiers what every labourer or serving-man would murmur to be refused for a single day .


I believe , sir , every gentleman , who examines the expense of his family , will find that each of his servants consumes daily at least three quarts of small beer , and surely it is not to be required that a soldier should live in a perpetual state of war with his constitution , and a constant inability to comply with the calls of nature .


General HANDASYD spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , the inclination shown by several gentlemen for a penurious and scanty provision for the soldiers , must , in my opinion , proceed from an inattentive consideration of their pay , and will , therefore , be removed , by laying before them an account of his condition , and comparing his daily pay with his daily expenses .


The whole pay of a foot soldier , sir , is sixpence a-day , of which he is to pay fourpence to his landlord for his diet , or , what is very nearly the same , to carry fourpence daily to the market , for which how small a supply of provisions he can bring to his quarters , especially in time of scarcity , I need not mention .


There remain then only twopence , sir , to be disbursed for things not immediately necessary for the preservation of life , but which no man can want without being despicable to others and burdensome to himself .
Twopence a-day is all that a soldier has to lay out upon cleanliness and decency , and with which he is likewise to keep his arms in order , and to supply himself with some part of his clothing .
If , sir , after these deductions , he can , from twopence a-day , procure himself the means of enjoying a few happy moments in the year with his companions over a cup of ale , is not his economy much more to be envied than his luxury ?
Or can it be charged upon him that he enjoys more than his share of the felicities of life ?
Is he to be burdened with new expenses lest he should hoard up the publick money , stop the circulation of coin , and turn broker or usurer with twopence a-day ?


I have been so long acquainted , sir , with the soldier 's character , that I will adventure to secure him from the charge of avarice , and to promise that whatever he shall possess not necessary to life , he will enjoy to the advantage of his landlord .


Then the advocate CAMPBELL spoke in substance as follows : -- Sir , I am far from intending to oppose this proposal of five pints , though , upon a rigorous examination , it might appear more than the mere wants of nature require  for I can not but declare that this question has too long engaged the attention of the house , and that the representatives of a mighty nation beset with enemies , and encumbered with difficulties , seem to forget their importance and their dignity , by wrangling from day to day upon a pint of small beer .


I conceive the bill , which we are now considering , sir , not as a perpetual and standing law , to be interwoven with our constitution , or added to the principles of our government , but as a temporary establishment for the present year  an expedient to be laid aside when our affairs cease to require it  an experimental essay of a new practice , which may be changed or continued according to its success .


To allow , sir , five pints of small beer a-day to our soldiers , for a single year , can produce no formidable inconveniency , and may , though it should not be entirely approved , be of less disadvantage to the publick , than the waste of another day .


[ An alteration was made to five pints , instead of three quarts  and the bill , thus amended , was ordered to be engrossed , and a few days afterwards , being read a third time , was passed , and ordered to the lords , where it occasioned no debate . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , APRIL 12 , 1741 .


[ DEBATE ON ADDRESSING THE KING . ]


A copy of his majesty 's speech being read , Mr. CLUTTERBUCK-BUCK rose , and spoke as follows : --


Sir , the present confusion in Europe , the known designs of the French , the numerous claims to the Austrian dominions , the armies which are levied to support them , and the present inability of the queen of Hungary to maintain those rights which descend to her from her ancestors , and have been confirmed by all the solemnities of treaties , evidently require an uncommon degree of attention in our consultations , and of vigour in our proceedings .


Whatever may be the professions of the French , their real designs are easily discovered , designs which they have carried on , either openly , or in private , for near a century , and which it can not be expected that they will lay aside , when they are so near to success .
Their view , sir , in all their wars and treaties , alliances and intrigues , has been the attainment of universal dominion , the destruction of the rights of nature , and the subjection of all the rest of mankind  nor have we any reason to imagine that they are not equally zealous for the promotion of this pernicious scheme , while they pour troops into Germany , for the assistance of their ally , as when they wasted kingdoms , laid cities in ashes , and plunged millions into misery and want , without any other motive than the glory of their king .


But the French are not the only nation at this time labouring for the subversion of our common liberties .
Our liberties , sir , are endangered by those equally interested with ourselves in their preservation  for in what degree soever any of the princes who are now endeavouring to divide among themselves the dominions of Austria , may be pleased with the acquisition of new territories , and an imaginary increase of influence and power , it must be evident to all who are not dazzled by immediate interest , that they are only fighting for France , and that by the destruction of the Austrian family , they must in a short time fall themselves .


It is well known , sir , though it is not always remembered , that political as well as natural greatness is merely comparative , and that he only is a powerful prince , who is more powerful than those with whom he can have any cause of contention .
That prince , therefore , who imagines his power enlarged by a partition of territories , which gives him some additional provinces , may be at last disappointed in his expectations : for , if this partition gives to another prince already greater than himself , an opportunity of increasing his strength in a degree proportionate to his present superiority , the former will soon find , that he has been labouring for nothing , and that his danger is still the same .


Such , sir , is the case of the king of Prussia , who , when he has overrun that part of Germany , to which he now lays claim , will only have weakened the house of Austria , without strengthening himself .


He is at present secure in the possession of his dominions , because neither the Austrians would suffer the French , nor the French permit the Austrians to increase-their power by subduing him .
Thus , while the present equipoise of power is maintained , jealousy and caution would always procure him an ally whenever he should be attacked  but when , by his assistance , the Austrian family shall be ruined , who shall defend him against the ambition of France ?


While the liberties of mankind are thus equally endangered by folly and ambition , attacked on one side , and neglected on the other , it is necessary for those who foresee the calamity that threatens them , to exert themselves in endeavours to avert it , and to retard the fatal blow , till those who are now lulled by the contemplation of private advantage , can be awakened into a just concern for the general happiness of Europe , and be convinced that they themselves can only be secure by uniting in the cause of liberty and justice .


For this reason , sir , our sovereign has asserted the Pragmatick sanction , and promised to assist the queen of Hungary with the forces which former treaties have entitled her to demand from him  for this reason he has endeavoured to rouse the Dutch from their supineness , and excite them to arm once more for the common safety , to intimidate , by new augmentations , those powers whose ardour , perhaps , only subsists upon the confidence that they shall not be resisted , and to animate , by open declarations in favour of the house of Austria , those who probably are only hindered from offering their assistance , by the fear of standing alone against the armies of France .


That by this conduct he may expose his dominions on the continent to invasions , ravages , and the other miseries of war , every one who knows their situation must readily allow  nor can it be doubted by any man who has heard of the power of the Prussians and French , that they may commit great devastations with very little opposition , the forces of the electorate not being sufficient to give them battle  for though the fortified towns might hold out against them , that consideration will very little alleviate the concern of those who consider the miseries of a nation , whose enemies are in possession of all the open country , and who from their ramparts see their harvest laid waste , and their villages in flames .
The fortifications contain the strength , but the field and the trading towns comprise the riches of a people , and the country may be ruined which is not subdued .


As , therefore , sir , the electoral dominions of his majesty are now endangered , not by any private dispute with the neighbouring princes , but by his firmness in asserting the general rights of Europe  as the consequences of his conduct , on this occasion , will be chiefly beneficial to Britain , we ought surely to support him in the prosecution of this design  a design which we can not but approve , since our ancestors have always carried it on without regard either to the danger or the expense .


In conformity to this maxim of politicks , so clearly founded in equity , and so often justified by the votes of the senate , has his majesty been pleased to declare to us his resolution to adhere to his engagements , and oppose all attempts that may be forming in favour of any unjust pretensions to the prejudice of the house of Austria .
'T is for this end he desires the concurrence of his senate .
I hope every gentleman in this house will agree with me that we ought to declare our approbation of these measures , in such terms as may show the world , that those who shall dare to obstruct them , must resolve to incur the resentment of this nation , and expose themselves to all the opposition which the senate of Britain can send forth against them .
We ought to pronounce that the territories of Hanover will be considered , on this occasion , as the dominions of Britain , and that any attack on one or the other will be equally resented .
I , therefore , move , that an humble address be presented by this house to his majesty ,


To return our thanks for his speech  to express our dutiful sense of his majesty 's just regard for the rights of the queen of Hungary , and for maintaining the Pragmatick sanction  to declare our concurrence in the prudent measures which his majesty is pursuing for the preservation of the liberties and balance of power in Europe  to acknowledge his majesty 's wisdom and resolution , in not suffering himself to be diverted from steadily persevering in his just purposes of fulfilling his engagements with the house of Austria  also , further to assure his majesty , that , in justice to and vindication of the honour and dignity of the British crown , we will effectually stand by and support his majesty against all insults and attacks , which any prince or power , in resentment of the just measures which he has so wisely taken , shall make upon any of his majesty 's dominions , though not belonging to the crown of Great Britain .
And that in any future events , which might make it necessary for him to enter into still larger expenses , this house will enable him to contribute , in the most effectual manner , to the support of the queen of Hungary , to the preventing , by all reasonable means , the subversion of the house of Austria , and to the maintaining the Pragmatick sanction and the liberties and balance of Europe .


Mr. FOX seconded the motion in this manner : -- Sir , the expediency , if not the necessity of the address now moved for , will , I believe , be readily allowed by those who consider the just measures which are pursued by his majesty , the end which is intended by them , and the powers by which they are opposed .


How much it is our duty to support the house of Austria it is not necessary to explain to any man who has heard the debates of this assembly , or read the history of the last war .
How much it is our duty to support it , is evident , as soon as it is known by whom it is attacked  by the ancient enemy of these nations , by the general disturber of the universe , by the formidable oppressors of liberty , exulting in new acquisitions , inflamed with the madness of universal monarchy , and elated with an opportunity of subjecting Germany , by exalting to the supreme power a prince who shall hold his authority only by their permission .


The house of Austria , which has so often stood forth in defence of our common rights , which has poured armies into the field , in confederacy with Britain , to suppress the insolence of that family which nothing could satisfy but boundless power , now demands the assistance which it has so often afforded  that assistance is demanded from us by every claim which the laws of society can enact , or the dictates of nature can suggest , by treaties maturely considered , and solemnly confirmed , by the ties of ancient friendship , and the obligations of common interest .


To violate the publick faith , and to neglect the observation of treaties , is to sink ourselves below barbarity , to destroy that confidence which unites mankind in society .
To deny or evade our stipulations , sir , is to commit a crime which every honest mind must consider with abhorrence , and to establish a precedent which may be used hereafter to our own destruction .


To forsake an ancient ally only because we can receive no immediate advantage from his friendship , or because it may be in some degree dangerous to adhere to him  to forsake him when he most wants our good offices , when he is distressed by his enemies , and deserted by others from whom he had reason to hope for kinder treatment , is the most despicable , the most hateful degree of cowardice and treachery .


The obligations of interest , sir , it is not often needful to enforce , but it may be observed on this occasion , that a single year of neglect may never be retrieved .
We may , sir , now be able to support those whom , when once dispossessed , it will not be in our power to restore  and that if we suffer the house of Austria to be overborne , our posterity , through every generation , may have reason to curse our injudicious parsimony , our fatal inactivity , and our perfidious cowardice .


With what views the king of Prussia concurs in the French measures , or upon what principles of policy he promises to himself any security in the enjoyment of his new dominions , it is not easy to conjecture  but as it is easy to discover , that whatever he may propose to himself , his conduct evidently tends to the ruin of Europe , so he may , in my opinion , justly be opposed , if he can not be diverted or made easy .


Nor can we , sir , if this opposition should incite him , or any other power , to an invasion of his majesty 's foreign dominions , refuse them our protection and assistance : for as they suffer for the cause which we are engaged to support , and suffer only by our measures , we are at least , as allies , obliged by the laws of equity and the general compacts of mankind , to arm in their defence  and what may be claimed by the common right of allies , we shall surely not deny them , only because they are more closely united to us , because they own the same monarch with ourselves .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , with what eagerness the French snatch every opportunity of increasing their influence , extending their dominions , and oppressing their neighbours , the experience of many years has convinced all Europe  and it is evident that unless some power be preserved in a degree of strength nearly equal to theirs , their schemes , pernicious as they are , can not be defeated .


That the only power from which this opposition can be hoped , is the house of Austria , a very superficial view of this part of the globe , will sufficiently demonstrate  of this we were long since so strongly convinced , that we employed all our forces and all our politicks to aggrandize this house .
We endeavoured not only to support it in all its hereditary rights , but to invest it with new sovereignties , and extend its authority over new dominions .


Why we afterwards varied in our councils and our measures , I have long inquired without any satisfaction , having never , sir , with the utmost application , been able to discover the motives to the memorable treaty of Hanover , by which we stipulated to destroy the fabrick that we had been so long and so laboriously endeavouring to erect  by which we abandoned that alliance which we had so diligently cultivated , which we had preferred to peace , plenty , and riches , and for which we had cheerfully supported a tedious , a bloody , and an expensive war .


This conduct , sir , raises a greater degree of admiration , as the authors of it had exhausted all their eloquence in censuring the treaty of Utrecht , and had endeavoured to expose those who transacted it to the general hatred of the nation  as they always expressed in the strongest terms their dread and detestation of the French  as they animated all their harangues , and stunned their opponents with declarations of their zeal for the liberties of Europe .


By what impulse or what infatuation , these asserters of liberty , these enemies of France , these guardians of the balance of power , were on the sudden prevailed on to declare in favour of the power whom they had so long thought it their chief interest and highest honour to oppose , must be discovered by sagacity superiour to mine .
But after such perplexity of councils and such fluctuation of conduct , it is necessary to inquire more particularly what are the present intentions of the ministry , what alliances have been formed , and what conditions are required to be fulfilled .


If we are obliged only to supply the queen of Hungary with twelve thousand men , we have already performed our engagements  if we have promised any pecuniary assistance , the sum which we have stipulated to furnish ought to be declared  for I suppose , at least , our engagements have some limits , and that we are not to exert all the force of the nation , to fight as if fire and sword were at our gates , or an invader were landing armies upon our coasts .


I have , sir , from my earliest years been zealous for the defence and exaltation of the house of Austria , and shall be very far from proposing that any danger or distress should influence us to desert it  but I do not easily discover by what means we shall be able to afford any efficacious assistance : for the power of Britain consists chiefly in naval armaments , which can be of very little use to the queen of Hungary , and I know not any state that will easily consent to unite with us on this occasion .


If there be , sir , any states remaining in Europe which the French can neither intimidate nor bribe , we ought studiously to solicit and diligently to cultivate their friendship  but whether any , except the Moscovites , are now independent , or sufficiently confident of their own strength to engage in such a hazardous alliance , may be justly doubted .


The late grand alliance , sir , was supported at the expense of this nation alone  nor was it required from the other confederates to exhaust the treasure of their country in the common cause .
I hope the debt which that war has entailed upon us will instruct us to be more frugal in our future engagements , and to stipulate only what we may perform without involving the nation in misery , which victories and triumphs can not compensate .


The necessity , sir , of publick economy obliges me to insist , that before any money shall be granted , an account be laid before the senate , in particular terms , of the uses to which it is to be applied .
To ask for supplies in general terms , is to demand the power of squandering the publick money at pleasure , and to claim , in softer language , nothing less than despotick authority .


It has not been uncommon for money , granted by the senate , to be spent without producing any of those effects which were expected from it , without assisting our allies , or humbling our enemies  and , therefore , there is reason for suspecting that money has sometimes been asked for one use and applied to another .


If our concurrence , sir , is necessary to increase his majesty 's influence on the continent , to animate the friends of the house of Austria , or to repress the disturbers of the publick tranquillity , I shall willingly unite with the most zealous advocates for the administration in any vote of approbation or assistance , not contrary to the act of settlement , that important and well-concerted act , by which the present family was advanced to the throne , and by which it is provided , that Britain shall never be involved in war for the enlargement or protection of the dominions of Hanover , dominions from which we never expected nor received any benefit , and for which , therefore , nothing ought to be either suffered or hazarded .


If it should be again necessary to form a confederacy , and to unite the powers of Europe against the house of Bourbon , that ambitious , that restless family , by which the repose of the world is almost every day interrupted , which is incessantly labouring against the happiness of human nature , and seeking every hour an opportunity of new encroachments , I declare , sir , that I shall not only , with the greatest cheerfulness , bear my share of the publick expense , but endeavour to reconcile others to their part of the calamities of war .
This , sir , I have advanced in confidence , that sufficient care shall be taken , that in any new alliance we shall be parties , not principals  that the expense of war , as the advantage of victory , shall be common  and that those who shall unite with us will be our allies , not our mercenaries .


Mr. WALPOLE then spoke , to the following purpose : -- Sir , it is not without reason that the honourable gentleman desires to be informed of the stipulations contained in the treaty by which we have engaged to support the Pragmatick sanction  for I find that he either never knew them or has forgotten them  and , therefore , those reasonings which he has formed upon them fall to the ground .


We are obliged , sir , by this treaty , to supply the house of Austria with twelve thousand men , and the Dutch , who were engaged in it by our example , have promised a supply of five thousand .
This force , joined to those armies which the large dominions of that family enable them to raise , were conceived sufficient to repel any enemy by whom their rights should be invaded .


But because in affairs of such importance nothing is to be left to hazard , because the preservation of the equipoise of power , on which the liberties of almost all mankind , who can call themselves free , must be acknowledged to depend , ought to be rather certain , than barely probable  it is stipulated farther , both by the French and ourselves , that if the supplies , specified in the first article , shall appear insufficient , we shall unite our whole force in the defence of our ally , and struggle , once more , for independence , with ardour proportioned to the importance of our cause .


By these stipulations , sir , no engagements have been formed that can be imagined to have been prohibited by the act of settlement , by which it is provided , that the house of Hanover shall not plunge this nation into a war , for the sake of their foreign dominions , without the consent of the senate  for this war is by no means entered upon for the particular security of Hanover , but for the general advantage of Europe , to repress the ambition of the French , and to preserve ourselves and our posterity from the most abject dependence upon a nation exasperated against us by long opposition , and hereditary hatred .


Nor is the act of settlement only preserved unviolated by the reasons of the present alliance , but by the regular concurrence of the senate which his majesty has desired , notwithstanding his indubitable right of making peace and war by his own authority .
I can not , therefore , imagine upon what pretence it can be urged , that the law , which requires that no war shall be made on account of the Hanoverian dominions without the consent of the senate , is violated , when it is evident that the war is made upon other motives , and the concurrence of the senate is solemnly desired .


But such is the malevolence with which the conduct of the administration is examined , that no degree of integrity or vigilance can secure it from censure .
When , in the present question , truth and reason are evidently on their side , past transactions are recalled to memory , and those measures are treated with the utmost degree of contempt and ridicule , of which the greatest part of the audience have probably forgotten the reasons , and of which the authors of them do not always stand up in the defence , because they are weary of repeating arguments to those who listen with a resolution never to be convinced .


How well , sir , those by whom the ministry is opposed , have succeeded in hardening their minds against the force of reason , is evident from their constant custom of appealing from the senate to the people , and publishing , in pamphlets , those arguments which they have found themselves , in this assembly , unable to support  a practice which discovers rather an obstinate resolution to obstruct the government , than zeal for the prosperity of their country , and which , to speak of it in the softest terms , seems to be suggested more by the desire of popularity than the love of truth .


Mr. SANDYS spoke to the effect following : -- Sir , notwithstanding the confidence with which this motion has been offered and defended , notwithstanding the specious appearance of respect to his majesty , by which it is recommended , I am not ashamed to declare , that it appears to me inconsistent with the trust reposed in us by our constituents , who owe their allegiance to the king of Britain , and not to the elector of Hanover .


It will be urged , sir , by the people , whom we sit here to represent , that they are already embarrassed with debts , contracted in a late war , from which , after the expense of many millions , and the destruction of prodigious multitudes , they receive no advantage  and that they are now loaded with taxes for the support of another , of which they perceive no prospect of a very happy or honourable conclusion , of either security or profit , either conquests or reprisals  and that they are , therefore , by no means willing to see themselves involved in any new confederacy , by which they may entail on their posterity the same calamities , and oblige themselves to hazard their fortunes and their happiness in defence of distant countries , of which many of them have scarcely heard , and from which no return of assistance is expected .


Mr. WALPOLE spoke again , to this purpose : -- Sir , though it is not necessary to refute every calumny that malice may invent , or credulity admit , or to answer those of whom it may reasonably be conceived that they do not credit their own accusations , I will yet rise , once more , in vindication of the treaty of Hanover , to show with how little reason it is censured , to repress the levity of insult , and the pride of unreasonable triumph .


The treaty of Hanover , sir , how long soever it has been ridiculed , and with whatever contempt those by whom it was negotiated have been treated , was wise and just .
It was just , because no injury was intended to any power , no invasion was planned , no partition of dominions stipulated , nothing but our own security desired .
It was wise , because it produced the end proposed by it , and established that security which the Austrians and Spaniards were endeavouring to destroy .


The emperour of Germany , sir , had then entered into a secret treaty of alliance with Spain , by which nothing less was designed than the total destruction of our liberties , the diminution of our commerce , the alienation of our dominions , and the subversion of our constitution .
We were to have been expelled from Gibraltar , and totally excluded from the Mediterranean , the pretender was to have been exalted to the throne , and a new religion , with the slavery that always accompanies it , to have been introduced amongst us , and Ostend was to have been made a port , and to have shared the poor remains of our commerce to foreign nations .


This unjust , this malicious confederacy , was then opposed with the utmost vehemence by the imperial general , whose courage and military capacity are celebrated throughout the world , and whose political abilities and knowledge of the affairs of Europe , were equal to his knowledge of war .
He urged , with great force , that such a confederacy would disunite the empire for ever from the maritime powers , by which it had been supported , and which were engaged by one common interest in the promotion of its prosperity : but his remonstrances availed nothing , and the alliance was concluded .


When our ancient allies , who had been so often succoured with our treasure , and defended by our arms , had entered into such engagements  when it was stipulated not only to impoverish but enslave us  not only to weaken us abroad , but to deprive us of every domestick comfort  when a scheme was formed that would have spread misery over the whole nation , and have extended its consequences to the lowest orders of the community , it was surely necessary to frustrate it by some alliance , and with whom could we then unite , but with France ?


This is not the only fact on which gentlemen have ventured to speak with great freedom without sufficient information  the conduct of our allies in the late war has been no less misrepresented than that of our ministers in their negotiations .
They have been charged with imposing upon us the whole expense of the confederacy , when it may be proved , beyond controversy , that the annual charge of the Dutch was five millions .


Nor did they , sir , only contribute annually thus largely to the common cause , but when we forsook the alliance , and shamefully abandoned the advantages we had gained , they received our mercenaries into their own pay , and expended nine millions in a single year .


Of the truth of these assertions it is easy to produce incontestable evidence , which , however , can not be necessary to any man who reflects , that from one of the most wealthy nations in the world , the Dutch , with all their commerce , and all their parsimony , are reduced to penury and distress  for who can tell by what means they have sunk into their present low condition , if they suffered nothing by the late war ?


How this gentleman , sir , has been deceived , and to whose insinuations his errours are to be imputed , I am at no loss to discover .
I hope he will , by this confutation , be warned against implicit credulity , and remember with what caution that man is to be trusted , whose pernicious counsels have endangered his country .


Mr. VYNER spoke thus : -- Sir , it is , in my opinion , an incontestable maxim , that no measures are eligible , which are unjust  and that , therefore , before any resolutions are formed , we ought to examine not what motives may be suggested by expedience , but what arguments may be advanced by equity on one part or the other .


If I do not mistake the true intent of the address now proposed , we are invited to declare that we will oppose the king of Prussia in his attempts upon Silesia , a declaration in which I know not how any man can concur , who knows not the nature of his claim , and the laws of the empire .
It ought , therefore , sir , to have been the first endeavour of those by whom this address has been so zealously promoted , to show that his claim , so publickly explained , so firmly urged , and so strongly supported , is without foundation in justice or in reason , and is only one of those imaginary titles , which ambition may always find to the dominions of another .


But no attempt has been yet made towards the discussion of this important question , and , therefore , I know not how any man can call upon us to oppose the king of Prussia , when his claim may probably be just , and , by consequence , such as , if it were necessary for us to engage in the affairs of those distant countries , we ought to join with him in asserting .


Lord GAGE spoke next , in substance as follows : -- Sir , as no member of this assembly can feel a greater degree of zeal for his majesty 's honour than myself  none shall more readily concur in any expression of duty or adherence to him .


But I have been always taught that allegiance to my prince is consistent with fidelity to my country , that the interest of the king and the people of great Britain is the same  and that he only is a true subject of the crown , who is a steady promoter of the happiness of the nation :


For this reason I think it necessary to declare , that Hanover is always to be considered as a sovereignty separate from that of Britain , and as a country with laws and interests distinct from ours  and that it is the duty of the representatives of this nation , to take care that interests so different may never be confounded , and that Britain may incur no expense of which Hanover alone can enjoy the advantage .


If the elector of Hanover should be engaged in war with any of the neighbouring sovereigns , who should be enabled , by a victory , to enter into the country , and carry the terrours of war through all his territories , it would by no means be necessary for this nation to interpose  for the elector of Hanover might lose his dominions without any disadvantage or dishonour to the king or people of Britain .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , APRIL 16 , 1741 .


DEBATE ON A MOTION FOR SUPPORTING THE QUEEN OF HUNGARY .


His majesty went this day to the house of lords , and after his assent to several bills , he , in a speech from the throne to both houses of the senate , acquainted them , that the war raised against the queen of Hungary , and the various claims on the late German emperour 's succession , might expose the dominions of such princes as should incline to support the Pragmatick sanction to imminent danger .
That the queen of Hungary required the twelve thousand men stipulated by treaty , and thereupon he had demanded of the king of Denmark , and of the king of Sweden , as sovereign of Hesse Cassel , their respective bodies of troops , of six thousand men each , to be in readiness to march to her assistance .
That he was concerting such farther measures as may disappoint all dangerous designs forming to the prejudice of the house of Austria , which might make it necessary for him to enter into still larger expenses for maintaining the Pragmatick sanction .
He , therefore , in a conjuncture so critical , desired the concurrence of his senate , in enabling him to contribute , in the most effectual manner , to the support of the queen of Hungary , the preventing , by all reasonable means , the subversion of the house of Austria , and to the maintaining the liberties and balance of power in Europe .


The house of commons , in their address upon this occasion , expressed a dutiful sense of his majesty 's just regard for the rights of the queen of Hungary , and for the maintaining the Pragmatick sanction  they declared their concurrence in the prudent measures which his majesty was pursuing for the preservation of the liberties and balance of power in Europe  they assured his majesty , that , in justice to , and vindication of the honour and dignity of the British crown , they would effectually stand by and support his majesty against all insults and attacks , which any power , in resentment of the just measures which he had so wisely taken , should make upon any of his majesty 's dominions , though not belonging to the crown of Great Britain .
They farther assured his majesty , that in any future events which might make it necessary for him to enter into still larger expenses , they would enable him to contribute , in the most effectual manner , to the support of the designs he proposed .


His majesty , in his answer to this address , observed their readiness in enabling him to make good his engagements with the queen of Hungary , and the assurances given him not to suffer his foreign dominions to be insulted on account of the measures he was pursuing for the support of the Pragmatick sanction , etc. .


In consequence of this procedure , the house , pursuant to order , resolved itself into a committee , to consider of the supplies granted to his majesty .


Upon this occasion , a motion was made by sir Robert WALPOLE for a grant of three hundred thousand pounds , for the support of the queen of Hungary , on which arose the following debate :


Sir Robert WALPOLE supported his motion by a speech , in substance as follows : -- Sir , the necessity of this grant appears so plainly from the bare mention of the purposes for which it is asked , that I can scarcely conceive that its reasonableness will be disputed .
I can discover no principles upon which an objection to this motion can be founded , nor the least arguments by which such objection can be supported .


The indispensable obligations of publick faith , the great ties by which nations are united , and confederacies formed , I can not suppose any man inclined to invalidate .
An exact performance of national promises , and inviolable adherence to treaties , is enforced at once by policy and justice , and all laws both of heaven and earth .


Publick perfidy , sir , like private dishonesty , whatever temporary advantages it may promise or produce , is always , upon the whole , the parent of misery .
Every man , however prosperous , must sometimes wish for a friend  and every nation , however potent , stand in need of an ally  but all alliances subsist upon mutual confidence , and confidence can be produced only by unlimited integrity , by known firmness , and approved veracity .


The use of alliances , sir , has , in the last age , been too much experienced to be contested  it is by leagues well concerted , and strictly observed , that the weak are defended against the strong , that bounds are set to the turbulence of ambition , that the torrent of power is restrained , and empires preserved from those inundations of war , that , in former times , laid the world in ruins .
By alliances , sir , the equipoise of power is maintained , and those alarms and apprehensions avoided , which must arise from daily vicissitudes of empire , and the fluctuations of perpetual contest .


That it is the interest of this nation to cultivate the friendship of the house of Austria , to protect its rights , and secure its succession , to inform it when mistaken , and to assist it when attacked , is allowed by every party .
Every man , sir , knows that the only power that can sensibly injure us , by obstructing our commerce , or invading our dominions , is France , against which no confederacy can be formed , except with the house of Austria , that can afford us any efficacious support .


The firmest bond of alliances is mutual interest .
Men easily unite against him whom they have all equal reason to fear and to hate  by whom they have been equally injured , and by whom they suspect that no opportunity will be lost of renewing his encroachments .
Such is the state of this nation , and of the Austrians .
We are equally endangered by the French greatness , and equally animated against it by hereditary animosities , and contests continued from one age to another  we are convinced that , however either may be flattered or caressed , while the other is invaded , every blow is aimed at both , and that we are divided only that we may be more easily destroyed .


For this reason we engaged in the support of the Pragmatick sanction , and stipulated to secure the imperial crown to the daughters of Austria  which was nothing more than to promise , that we would endeavour to prevent our own destruction , by opposing the exaltation of a prince who should owe his dignity to the French , and , in consequence of so close an alliance , second all their schemes , admit all their claims , and sacrifice to their ambition the happiness of a great part of mankind .


Such would probably be the consequence , if the French should gain the power of conferring the imperial crown .
They would hold the emperour in perpetual dependence , would , perhaps , take possession of his hereditary dominions , as a mortgage for their expenses  would awe him with the troops which they sent under a pretence of assisting him , and leave him only the titles of dominion , and the shadows of empire .


In this state would he remain , whilst his formidable allies were extending their dominions on every side .
He would see one power subdued after another , and himself weakened by degrees , and only not deprived of his throne , because it would be unnecessary to dethrone him  or he would be obliged to solicit our assistance to break from his slavery , and we should be obliged , at the utmost hazard , and at an expense not to be calculated , to remedy what it is , perhaps , now in our power to prevent with very little difficulty .


That this danger is too near to be merely chimerical , that the queen of Hungary is invaded , and her right to the imperial dignity contested , is well known  it is , therefore , the time for fulfilling our engagements  engagements of the utmost importance to ourselves and our posterity  and I hope the government will not be accused of profusion , if , for three hundred thousand pounds , the liberties of Europe shall be preserved .


We can not deny this grant without acting in opposition to our late professions of supporting his majesty in his endeavours to maintain the Pragmatick sanction , and of assisting him to defend his foreign dominions from any injuries to which those endeavours should expose them  for how can he without forces defend his dominions , or assist his ally ?
or how can he maintain forces without supplies ?


Mr. SHIPPEN next rose , and spoke thus : -- Sir , as I have always endeavoured to act upon conviction of my duty , to examine opinions before I admit them , and to speak what I have thought the truth , I do not easily change my conduct , or retract my assertions  nor am I deterred from repeating my arguments when I have a right to speak , by the remembrance that they have formerly been unsuccessful .


Every man , when he is confident himself , conceives himself able to persuade others , and imagines that their obstinacy proceeds from other motives than reason  and that , if he fails at one time to gain over his audience , he may yet succeed in some happier moment , when their prejudices shall be dissipated , or their interest varied .


For this reason , though it can not be suspected that I have forgotten the resentment which I have formerly drawn upon myself , by an open declaration of my sentiments with regard to Hanover , I stand up again , with equal confidence , to make my protestations against any interposition in the affairs of that country , and to avow my dislike of the promise lately made to defend it : a promise , inconsistent , in my opinion , with that important and inviolable law , the act of settlement !
-- a promise , which , if it could have been foreknown , would , perhaps , have for ever precluded from the succession that illustrious family , to which we owe such numberless blessings , such continued felicity !


Far be it from me to insinuate that we can be too grateful to his majesty , or too zealous in our adherence to him  only let us remember , that true gratitude consists in real benefits , in promoting the true interest of him to whom we are indebted  and surely , by hazarding the welfare of Britain in defence of Hanover , we shall very little consult the advantage , or promote the greatness of our sovereign .


It is well known how inconsiderable , in the sight of those by whom the succession was established , Hanover appeared , in comparison with Britain .
Those men , to whom even their enemies have seldom denied praise for knowledge and capacity , and who have been so loudly celebrated by many , who have joined in the last address , for their honest zeal , and the love of their country , enacted , that the king of Britain should never visit those important territories , which we have so solemnly promised to defend , at the hazard of our happiness .
It was evidently their design that our sovereign , engrossed by the care of his new subjects , a care which , as they reasonably imagined , would arise from gratitude for dignity and power so liberally conferred , should in time forget that corner of the earth on which his ancestors had resided , and act , not as elector of Hanover , but as king of Britain , as the governour of a mighty nation , and the lord of large dominions .


It was expressly determined , that , this nation should never be involved in war for the defence of the dominions on the continent , and , doubtless , the same policy that has restrained us from extending our conquests in countries from which some advantages might be received , ought to forbid all expensive and hazardous measures , for the sake of territories from whence no benefit can be reaped .


Nor are the purposes , sir , for which this supply is demanded , the only objections that may be urged against it , for the manner in which it is asked , makes it necessary at least to delay it .
The ministers have been so little accustomed to refusals that they have forgot when to ask with decency , and expect the treasure of the nation to be poured upon them , whenever they shall think it proper to hint that they have discovered some new opportunity of expense .


It is necessary , that when a supply is desired , the house should be informed , some time before , of the sum that is required , and of the ends to which it is to be applied , that every member may consider , at leisure , the expediency of the measures proposed , and the proportion of the sum to the occasion on which it is demanded  that he may examine what are the most proper methods of raising it , and , perhaps , inquire with what willingness his constituents will advance it .


Whether any man is enabled by his acuteness and experience , to determine all these questions upon momentaneous reflection , I can not decide .
For my part , I confess myself one of those on whom nature has bestowed no such faculties , and therefore move that the consideration of this supply may be deferred for a few days  for if it be now pressed upon us , I shall vote against it , because I do not yet fully discover all the reasons for it , nor all the consequences which it may produce , and I think myself obliged to know for what purpose I give away the money which is not my own .


Mr. VYNER spoke as follows : -- Sir , whatever may be the necessity of maintaining the Pragmatick sanction , or whatever the obligations of national pacts , of which I hope no man is desirous of countenancing the neglect , yet they can not oblige us to arm without an enemy , to embarrass ourselves with watching every possibility of danger , to garrison dominions which are not threatened , or assert rights which are not invaded .


The expediency of maintaining the house of Austria on the imperial throne , it is not at present necessary to assert , because it does not appear that any other family is aspiring to it .
There may , indeed , be whispers of secret designs and artful machinations , whispers , perhaps , spread only to affright the court into treaties , or the senate into grants  or designs , which , like a thousand others that every day produces , innumerable accidents may defeat  which may be discovered , not only before they are executed , but before they are fully formed , and which , therefore , are not worthy to engross much of our attention , or to exhaust the wealth of the people .


The Pragmatick sanction is nothing more than a settlement of the imperial dignity upon the eldest daughter of the late German emperour and her son  and if she has no son , upon the son of the second daughter  nor has the crown of Britain , by engaging to support that sanction , promised any thing more than to preserve this order of succession , which no power , at present , is endeavouring to interrupt  and which , therefore , at present , requires no defence .


The dispute , sir , between the king of Prussia and the queen of Hungary , is of a different kind  nor is it our duty to engage in it , either as parties or judges .
He lays claim to certain territories usurped , as he alleges , from his ancestors by the Austrian family , and asserts , by force , this claim , which is equally valid , whether the queen be emperess or not .
We have no right to limit his dominions , or obligation to examine the justice of his demands .
If he is only endeavouring to gain what has been forcibly withheld from him , what right have we to obstruct his undertaking ?
And if the queen can show a better title , she is , like all other sovereigns , at liberty to maintain it  nor are we necessarily to erect ourselves into judges between sovereigns , or distributors of dominions .


The contest seems to have very little relation to the Pragmatick sanction : if the king of Prussia succeeds , he will contribute to support it  and if the queen is able to frustrate his designs , she will be too powerful to need our assistance .


But though , sir , the Pragmatick sanction were in danger of violation , are we to stand up alone in defence of it , while other nations , equally engaged with ourselves by interest and by treaties , sit still to look upon the contest , and gather those advantages of peace which we indiscreetly throw away ?
Are we able to maintain it without assistance , or are we to exhaust our country , and ruin our posterity in prosecution of a hopeless project , to spend what can never be repaid , and to fight with certainty of a defeat ?


The Dutch , whose engagements and whose interests are the same as our own , have not yet made any addition to their expenses , nor augmentation of their troops  nor does a single potentate of Europe , however united by long alliances to the house of Austria , or however endangered by revolutions in the empire , appear to rouse at the approach of alarm , or think himself obliged to provoke enemies by whom he is not yet injured .


I can not , therefore , persuade myself that we are to stand up single in the defence of the Pragmatick sanction , to fight the quarrel of others , or live in perpetual war , that our neighbours may be at peace .


I shall always think it my duty to disburse the publick money with the utmost parsimony , nor ever intend , but on the most pressing necessity , to load with new exactions a nation already overwhelmed with debts , harassed with taxes , and plundered by a standing army .


For what purpose these numerous forces are maintained , who are now preying on the publick  why we increase our armies by land when we only fight by sea  why we aggravate the burden of the war , and add domestick oppressions to foreign injuries , I am at a loss to determine .
Surely some regard should be had to the satisfaction of the people , who ought not , during the present scarcity of provisions , to be starved by the increase of an army , which seems supported only to consume them .


As , therefore , part of our present expense is , in my opinion , unnecessary , I shall not contribute to aggravate it by a new grant , for purposes of which I can not discover that they will promote the advantage of the publick .


Sir Robert WALPOLE replied to the following effect : -- Sir , the Pragmatick sanction , which we are engaged to support , is not confined to the preservation of the order of succession , but extends to all the rights of the house of Austria , which is now attacked , and by a very formidable enemy , at a time of weakness and distraction , and therefore requires our assistance .


That others , equally obliged by treaty and by interest to lend their help on this occasion , sit reluctive , either through cowardice or negligence , or some prospect of temporary advantage , may , perhaps , be true  but is it any excuse of a crime , that he who commits it is not the only criminal ?
Will the breach of faith in others excuse it in us ?
Ought we not rather to animate them by our activity , instruct them by our example , and awaken them by our representations ?


Perhaps the other powers say to themselves , and to one another , Why should we keep that treaty which Britain is violating ?
Why should we expose ourselves to danger , of which that mighty nation , so celebrated for courage , is afraid ?
Why should we rush into war , in which our most powerful ally seems unwilling to support us ?


Thus the same argument , an argument evidently false , and made specious only by interest , may be used by all , till some one , more bold and honest than the rest , shall dare to rise in vindication of those rights which all have promised to maintain  and why should not the greatest nation be the first that shall avow her solemn engagements ?
Why should not they be most diligent in the prosecution of an affair who have most to lose by its miscarriage ?


I am always willing to believe , that no member of this assembly makes use , in any solemn debate , of arguments which do not appear rational to himself , and yet it is difficult to conceive that any man can imagine himself released from a promise , because the same promise is broken by another , or that he is at liberty to desert his friend in distress , because others desert him , whose good offices he has equal reason to expect , and that the more his assistance is needed , the more right he has to deny it .


Surely such arguments as these deserve not , need not a confutation .
Before we regulate our conduct by that of others , we must either prove that they have done right , which proof will be a sufficient defence without the precedent , or own that they are more capable of judging than we , and that , therefore , we pay an implicit submission to their dictates and example  a sacrifice which we shall not willingly make to the vanity of our neighbours .


In the present case it is evident that if other nations neglect the performance of their contracts , they are guilty of the breach of publick faith  of a crime , that , if it should generally be imitated , would dissolve society , and throw human nature into confusion , that would change the most happy region into deserts , in which one savage would be preying on another .


Nor are they only propagating an example , which in some distant times may be pleaded against themselves , but they are exposing themselves to more immediate dangers  they are forwarding designs that have no tendency but to their ruin , they are adding strength to their inveterate enemies , and beckoning invasion to their own frontiers .


Let us , therefore , instead of hardening ourselves in perfidy , or lulling ourselves in security by their example , exert all our influence to unite them , and all our power to assist them .
Let us show them what they ought to determine by our resolutions , and teach them to act by our vigour  that , if the house of Austria be preserved , our alliance may be strengthened by new motives of gratitude  and that , if it must be that the liberties of this part of the world be lost , we may not reproach ourselves with having neglected to defend them .


Mr. PELHAM spoke next to this purpose : -- Sir , it is not to be supposed that such members of this assembly as are not engaged in publick affairs , should receive very exact intelligence of the dispositions of foreign powers , and , therefore , I do not wonder that the conduct of the Dutch has been misrepresented , and that they are suspected of neglecting their engagements at a time when they are endeavouring to perform them .


The Dutch have now under consideration the most proper methods of assisting the queen of Hungary , and maintaining the Pragmatick sanction  it may be , indeed , justly suspected , from the nature of their constitution , that their motions will be slow , but it can not be asserted , that they break their engagements , or desert their confederates .


Nor is there any reason for imagining that the other princes , who have incurred the same obligations , will not endeavour to perform their promises  it may be easily conceived that some of them are not able at a sudden summons to afford great assistance , and that others may wait the result of our deliberations , and regulate their conduct by our example .


Not that we ought to neglect our engagements , or endanger our country , because other powers are either perfidious , or insensible  for I am not afraid to declare , that if that should happen , which there is no reason to suspect , if all the other powers should desert the defence of the Austrian line , should consent to annul the Pragmatick sanction , and leave the queen of Hungary to the mercy of her enemies , I would advise that Britain alone should pour her armies into the continent , that she should defend her ally against the most formidable confederacy , and show mankind an example of constancy not to be shaken , and of faith not to be violated .


If it be , therefore , our duty to support the Pragmatick sanction , it is now the time for declaring our resolutions , when the imperial crown is claimed by a multitude of competitors , among whom the elector of Bavaria , a very powerful prince , has , by his minister , notified his pretensions to the court of Britain .


The ancient alliance between this prince and the French is well known , nor can we doubt that he will now implore their assistance for the attainment of the throne to which he aspires  and I need not say what may be expected from an emperour , whose elevation was procured by the forces of France .


Nor is this the only prince that claims the imperial crown upon plausible pretences , or whose claims other powers may combine to support  it is well known , that even the Spanish monarch believes himself entitled to it , nor can we , who have no communication with him , know whether he has not declared to all the other princes of Europe , his resolution to assert his claim .


It is far from being impossible that the pretensions of the house of Bourbon may be revived , and that though no single prince of that family should attempt to mount the imperial throne , they may all conspire to dismember the empire into petty kingdoms , and free themselves from the dread of a formidable neighbour , by erecting a number of diminutive sovereigns , who may be always courting the assistance of their protectors , for the sake of harassing each other .


Thus will the house by which Europe has been hitherto protected , sink into an empty name , and we shall be left to stand alone against all the powers that profess a different religion , and whose interest is opposite to that of Britain .


We ought , indeed , to act with the utmost vigour , when we see one of the most powerful of the reformed princes so far forgetful of the interest of our religion , as to cooperate with the designs of France , and so intent upon improving the opportunity of distressing the house of Austria , as to neglect the common cause , and expose himself or his posterity to the danger of becoming a dependant on the house of Bourbon .


For this reason , I can not agree that our army , though numerous and burdensome , is greater than the necessity of affairs requires : if we cast our eyes on the continent , nothing is to be seen but general confusion , powerful armies in motion , the dominions of one prince invaded , of another threatened  the tumults of ambition in one place , and a panick stillness in another .


What will be the event of these commotions who can discover ?
And how can we know what may determine the course of that flood of power , which is now in a state of uncertain fluctuation , or seems driven to different points by different impulses ?
How soon may the Dutch see their barrier attacked , and call upon us for the ten thousand men which we are obliged to send them ?
How soon may the house of Austria be so distressed , as to require all our power for its preservation ?


That we are to leave nothing unattempted for the security of our own religion and liberty , will easily be granted , and , therefore , unless it can be proved that we may be equally secure , though the house of Austria be ruined , it will necessarily follow that we are , with all our power , to enforce the observation of the Pragmatick sanction .


This is not an act of romantick generosity , but such as the closest attention to our own interest shows to be necessary  in defending the queen of Hungary we defend ourselves , and only extinguish that flame , by which , if it be suffered to spread , we shall ourselves be consumed .
The empire may be considered as the bulwark of Britain , which , if it be thrown down , leaves us naked and defenceless .


Let us , therefore , consider our own danger , and remember , that while we are considering this supply , we are deliberating upon nothing less than the fate of our country .


Mr. PULTENEY spoke next , to the effect following : -- Sir , I am on this occasion of an opinion different from that of the honourable member who spoke the second in this debate , though on most questions our judgment has been the same .
I am so far from seconding his proposal for delaying the consideration of this supply , that I think it may justly be inquired , why it was not sooner proposed .


For the support of the house of Austria , and the assertion of the Pragmatick sanction , no man can be more zealous than myself  I am convinced how closely the interest of this nation and that of the Austrian family are united , and how much either must be endangered by the ruin of the other , and , therefore , I shall not delay , for a single moment , my consent to any measures that may reestablish our interest on the continent , and rescue Germany once more from the jaws of France .


I am afraid that we have lost part of our influence in the neighbouring countries , and that the name of Britain is less formidable than heretofore  but if reputation is lost , it is time to recover it , and I doubt not but it may be recovered by the same means that it was at first obtained .
Our armies may be yet equally destructive , and our money equally persuasive .


We have not yet suffered , amidst all our misconduct , our naval force to be diminished  our sailors yet retain their ancient courage , and our fleets are sufficient to keep the dominion of the ocean , and prescribe limits to the commerce of every nation .
While this power remains unimpaired , while Britain retains her natural superiority , and asserts the honour of her flag in every climate , we can not become despicable , nor can any nation ridicule our menaces or scorn our alliance .
We may still extend our influence to the inland countries , and awe those nations which we can not invade .


To preserve this power let us watch over the disposal of our money  money is the source of dominion  those nations may be formidable for their affluence which are not considerable for their numbers  and by a negligent profusion of their wealth , the most powerful people may languish into imbecility , and sink into contempt .


If the grant which is now demanded will be sufficient to produce the ends to which it is proposed to be applied , if we are assured of the proper application of it , I shall agree to it without hesitation .
But though it can not be affirmed that the sum now demanded is too high a price for the liberties of Europe , it is at least more than ought to be squandered without effect , and we ought at least to know before we grant it , what advantages may be expected from it .


May not the sum demanded for the support of the queen of Hungary be employed to promote very different interests ?
May it not be lavished to support that power , to which our grants have too long contributed ?
that power by which ourselves have been awed , and the administration has tyrannised without control ?


If this sum is really intended to support the queen of Hungary , may we not inquire how it is to be employed for her service ?
Is it to be sent her for the payment of her armies , and the support of her court ?
Should we not more effectually secure her dominions by purchasing with it the friendship and assistance of the king of Prussia , a prince , whose extent of dominions and numerous forces , make him not more formidable than his personal qualities .


What may be hoped , sir , from a prince of wisdom and courage , at the head of a hundred and ten thousand regular troops , with eight millions in his treasury ?
How much he must necessarily add to the strength of any party in which he shall engage , is unnecessary to mention  it is evident , without proof , that nothing could so much contribute to the reestablishment of the house of Austria , as a reconciliation with this mighty prince , and that , to bring it to pass , would be the most effectual method of serving the unfortunate queen that requires our assistance .


Why we should despair , sir , of such a reconciliation I can not perceive  a reconciliation equally conducive to the real interest of both parties .
It may be proved , with very little difficulty , to the king of Prussia , that he is now assisting those with whom interests incompatible and religions irreconcilable have set him at variance , whom he can never see prosperous but by the diminution of his own greatness , and who will always project his ruin while they are enjoying the advantages of his victories .
We may easily convince him that their power will soon become , by his assistance , such as he can not hope to withstand , and show , from the examples of other princes , how dangerous it is to add to the strength of an ambitious neighbour .
We may show him how much the fate of the empire is now in his hands , and how much more glorious and more advantageous it will be to preserve it from ruin , than to contribute to its destruction .


If by such arguments , sir , this potent monarch can be induced to act steadily in defence of the common cause , we may once more stand at the head of a protestant confederacy  of a confederacy that may contract the views and repress the ambition of the house of Bourbon , and alter their schemes of universal monarchy into expedients for the defence of their dominions .


But in transacting these affairs , let us not engage in any intricate treaties , nor amuse ourselves with displaying our abilities for negotiation  negotiation , that fatal art which we have learned as yet very imperfectly , and which we have never attempted to practise but to our own loss .
While we have been entangled in tedious disquisitions , and retarded by artful delays , while our commissaries have been debating about what was only denied to produce controversies , and inquiring after that which has been hid from them only to divert their attention from other questions , how many opportunities have been lost , and how often might we have secured by war , what was , at a much greater expense , lost by treaties .


Treaties , sir , are the artillery of our enemies , to which we have nothing to oppose  they are weapons of which we know not the use , and which we can only escape by not coming within their reach .
I know not by what fatality it is , that to treat and to be cheated , are , with regard to Britons , words of the same signification  nor do I intend , by this observation , to asperse the characters of particular persons , for treaties , by whomsoever carried on , have ended always with the same success .


It is time , therefore , to know , at length , our weakness and our strength , and to resolve no longer to put ourselves voluntarily into the power of our enemies : our troops have been always our ablest negotiators , and to them it has been , for the most part , necessary at last to refer our cause .


Let us , then , always preserve our martial character , and neglect the praise of political cunning  a quality which , I believe , we shall never attain , and which , if we could obtain , would add nothing to our honour .
Let it be the practice of the Britons to declare their resolutions without reserve , and adhere to them in opposition to danger  let them be ambitious of no other elogies than those which may be gained by honesty and courage , nor will they then ever find their allies diffident , or their enemies contemptuous .


By recovering and asserting this character , we may become once more the arbiters of Europe , and be courted by all the protestant powers as their protectors : we may once more subdue the ambition of the aspiring French , and once more deliver the house of Austria from the incessant pursuit of those restless enemies .


The defence of that illustrious family , sir , has always appeared to me , since I studied the state of Europe , the unvariable interest of the British nation , and our obligations to support it on this particular occasion have already been sufficiently explained .


Whence it proceeded , sir , that those who now so zealously espouse the Austrian interest , have been so plainly forgetful of it on other occasions , I can not determine .
That treaties have been made very little to the advantage of that family , and that its enemies have been suffered to insult it without opposition , is well known  nor was it long ago that it was debated in this house , whether any money should be lent to the late emperour .


No publick or private character can be supported , no enemy , sir , can be intimidated , nor any friend confirmed in his adherence , but by a steady and consistent conduct , by proposing , in all our actions , such ends as may be openly avowed , and by pursuing them without regard to temporary inconveniencies , or petty obstacles .


Such conduct , sir , I would gladly recommend on the present occasion , on which I should be far from advising a faint , an irresolute , or momentary assistance , such supplies as declare diffidence in our own strength , or a mean inclination to please contrary parties at the same time , to perform our engagements with the queen , and continue our friendship with France .
It is , in my opinion , proper to espouse our ally with the spirit of a nation that expects her decisions to be ratified , that holds the balance of the world in her hand , and can bestow conquest and empire at her pleasure .


Yet , sir , it can not be denied that many powerful reasons may be brought against any new occasions of expense , nor is it without horrour and astonishment that any man , conversant in political calculations , can consider the enormous profusion of the national treasure .
In the late dreadful confusion of the world , when the ambition of France had set half the nations of the earth on flame , when we sent our armies to the continent , and fought the general quarrel of mankind , we paid , during the reigns of king William and his great successour , reigns of which every summer was distinguished by some important action , but four millions yearly .


But our preparations for the present war , in which scarcely a single ship of war has been taken , or a single fortress laid in ruins , have brought upon the nation an expense of five millions .
So much more are we now obliged to pay to amuse the weakest , than formerly to subdue the most powerful of our enemies .


Frugality , which is always prudent , is , at this time , sir , indispensable , when war , dreadful as it is , may be termed the lightest of our calamities  when the seasons have disappointed us of bread , and an universal scarcity afflicts the nation .
Every day brings us accounts from different parts of the country , and every account is a new evidence of the general calamity , of the want of employment for the poor , and its necessary consequence , the want of food .


He that is scarce able to preserve himself , can not be expected to assist others  nor is that money to be granted to foreign powers , which is wanted for the support of our fellow-subjects , who are now languishing with diseases , which unaccustomed hardships and unwholesome provisions have brought upon them , while we are providing against distant dangers , and bewailing the distresses of the house of Austria .


Let us not add to the miseries of famine the mortifications of insult and neglect  let our countrymen , at least , divide our care with our allies , and while we form schemes for succouring the queen of Hungary , let us endeavour to alleviate nearer distresses , and prevent or pacify domestick discontents .


If there be any man whom the sight of misery can not move to compassion , who can hear the complaints of want without sympathy , and see the general calamity of his country without employing one hour on schemes for its relief  let not that man dare to boast of integrity , fidelity , or honour  let him not presume to recommend the preservation of our faith , or adherence to our confederates : that wretch can have no real regard to any moral obligation , who has forgotten those first duties which nature impresses  nor can he that neglects the happiness of his country , recommend any good action for a good reason .


It should be considered , sir , that we can only be useful to our allies , and formidable to our enemies , by being unanimous and mutually confident of the good intentions of each other , and that nothing but a steady attention to the publick welfare , a constant readiness to remove grievances , and an apparent unwillingness to impose new burdens , can produce that unanimity .


As the cause is , therefore , necessarily to precede the effect , as foreign influence is the consequence of happiness at home , let us first endeavour to establish that alacrity and security that may animate the people to assert their ancient superiority to other nations , and restore that plenty which may raise them above any temptation to repine at assistance given to our allies .


No man , sir , can very solicitously watch over the welfare of his neighbour whose mind is depressed by poverty , or distracted by terrour  and when the nation shall see us anxious for the preservation of the queen of Hungary , and unconcerned about the wants of our fellow-subjects , what can be imagined , but that we have some method of exempting ourselves from the common distress , and that we regard not the publick misery when we do not feel it ?


Sir Robert WALPOLE replied , to the following effect : -- Sir , it is always proper for every man to lay down some principles upon which he proposes to act , whether in publick or private  that he may not be always wavering , uncertain , and irresolute  that his adherents may know what they are to expect , and his adversaries be able to tell why they are opposed .


It is necessary , sir , even for his own sake , that he may not be always struggling with himself  that he may know his own determinations , and enforce them by the reasons which have prevailed upon him to form them  that he may not argue in the same speech to contrary purposes , and weary the attention of his hearers with contrasts and antitheses .


When a man admits the necessity of granting a supply , expatiates upon the danger that may be produced by retarding it , declares against the least delay , however speciously proposed , and enforces the arguments which have been already offered to show how much it is our duty and interest to allow it  may it not reasonably be imagined , that he intends to promote it , and is endeavouring to convince them of that necessity of which he seems himself convinced ?


But when the same man proceeds to display , with equal eloquence , the present calamities of the nation , and tells to how much better purposes the sum thus demanded may be applied  when he dwells upon the possibility that an impolitick use may be made of the national treasure , and hints that it may be asked for one purpose and employed to another , what can be collected from his harangue , however elegant , entertaining , and pathetick ?
How can his true opinion be discovered ?
Or how shall we fix such fugitive reasonings , such variable rhetorick ?


I am not able , sir , to discern , why truth should be obscured  or why any man should take pleasure in heaping together all the arguments that his knowledge may supply , or his imagination suggest , against a proposition which he can not deny .
Nor can I assign any good purpose that can be promoted by perpetual renewals of debate , and by a repetition of objections , which have in former conferences , on the same occasion , been found of little force .


When the system of affairs is not fully laid open , and the schemes of the administration are in part unknown , it is easy to raise objections formidable in appearance , which , perhaps , can not be answered till the necessity of secrecy is taken away .
When any general calamity has fallen upon a nation , it is a very fruitful topick of rhetorick , and may be very pathetically exaggerated , upon a thousand occasions to which it has no necessary relation .


Such , In my opinion , sir , is the use now made of the present scarcity , a misfortune inflicted upon us by the hand of providence alone  not upon us only , but upon all the nations on this side of the globe , many of which suffer more , but none less than ourselves .


If at such a time it is more burdensome to the nation to raise supplies , it must be remembered , that it is in proportion difficult to other nations to oppose those measures for which the supplies are granted  and that the same sum is of greater efficacy in times of scarcity than of plenty .


Our present distress will , I hope , soon be at an end  and , perhaps , a few days may produce at least some alteration .
It is not without reason , that I expect the news of some successful attempts in America , which will convince the nation , that the preparations for war have not been idle shows , contrived to produce unnecessary expenses .


In the mean time it is necessary that we support that power which may be able to assist us against France , the only nation from which any danger can threaten us , even though our fleets in America should be unsuccessful .


If we defeat the Spaniards , we may assist the house of Austria without difficulty , and if we fail in our attempts , their alliance will be more necessary .
The sum demanded for this important purpose can not be censured as exorbitant , yet will , I hope , be sufficient : if more should hereafter appear necessary , I doubt not but it will be granted .


The question passed without opposition .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , DECEMBER 1 , 1741 .


[ DEBATE ON CHOOSING A SPEAKER . ]


The new house of commons being met , the usher came from the house of lords , with his majesty 's commands for their immediate attendance , when they were ordered to choose a speaker  and being returned , Mr. PELHAM addressed himself in the following manner to the clerk of the house :


Mr. HARDINGE ,


As we are here assembled , in pursuance of the imperial summons , it is necessary , in obedience to his majesty 's commands , and the established custom of this house , that we proceed immediately to the choice of a person qualified for the chair .
-- Gentlemen , it is with no common degree of satisfaction , that I observe this assembly so numerous on the first day  because whatever is transacted by us , must necessarily be considered by the nation with more regard , as it is approved by a greater number of their representatives  and because the present affair , which relates particularly to this house , must be more satisfactorily conducted , as our number is greater  since every man must willingly abide by his own choice , and cheerfully submit to that authority , of which he has himself concurred to the establishment .


The qualifications required in the person who shall fill the chair , to his own reputation , and the advantage of the house , it is not necessary minutely to recount  it being obvious to every gentleman who hears me , that he must possess such an equality of temper , as may enable him always to preserve a steady and impartial attention , neither discomposed by the irregularities into which some gentlemen , unacquainted with the forms of this assembly , may easily fall , nor disconcerted by the heat and turbulence to which , in former parliaments , some of those whose experience might have taught them the necessity of decency , have been too often hurried by the eagerness of controversy .
That he must add to his perpetual serenity , such a firmness of mind , as may enable him to repress petulance and subdue contumacy , and support the orders of the house , in whatever contrariety of counsels , or commotion of debate , against all attempts of infraction or deviation .
That to give efficacy to his interpositions , and procure veneration to his decisions , he must , from his general character and personal qualities , derive such dignity and authority , as may naturally dispose the minds of others to obedience , as may suppress the murmurs of envy , and prevent the struggles of competition .


These qualifications were eminently conspicuous in the gentleman who filled the chair in the earlier part of my life , and who is now one of the ornaments of the other house .
Such were his abilities , and such his conduct , that it would be presumptuous in any man , however endowed by nature , or accomplished by study , to aspire to surpass him  nor can a higher encomium be easily conceived , than this house bestowed upon that person , who was thought worthy to succeed him .


The office which we have now to confer , is not only arduous with regard to the abilities necessary to the execution of it , but extremely burdensome and laborious , such as requires continual attendance , and incessant application  nor can it be expected that any man would engage in it , who is not ready to devote his time and his health to the service of the publick , and to struggle with fatigue and restraint for the advantage of his country .


Such is the gentleman whom I shall propose to your choice  one whose zeal for the present imperial house , and the prosperity of the nation , has been always acknowledged , and of whom it can not be suspected that he will be deterred by any difficulties from a province which will afford him so frequent opportunities of promoting the common interest of the emperour and the people .


What success may be expected from his endeavours , we can only judge from his present influence  influence produced only by his private virtues  but so extensive in that part of the nation which lies within the reach of his beneficence , and the observation of his merit , that it sets him not only above the danger , but above the fear of opposition , and secures him a seat in this assembly without contest .


Thus deputed by his country to many successive senates , he has acquired an unrivalled degree of knowledge in the methods of our proceedings , and an eminent dexterity in digesting them with that order and perspicuity by which only the transaction of great affairs can be made expeditious , and the discussion of difficult questions be disentangled from perplexity  qualities which are now made particularly necessary by the importance of the subjects to be considered in this senate : so that I doubt not but you will unanimously concur with me in desiring that the chair may be filled by a person eminently distinguished by his knowledge , his integrity , his diligence , and his reputation  and therefore I move , without scruple , that the right honourable Arthur ONSLOW , esquire , be called to the chair .


Then Mr. CLUTTERBUCK seconded the motion in this manner : -- That I am not able to add any thing to the encomium of the right honourable gentleman nominated to the president 's chair , gives me no concern , because I am confident , that in the opinion of this assembly , his name alone includes all panegyrick , and that he who recommends Arthur ONSLOW , esquire , will never be required to give the reason of his choice .
I therefore rise now only to continue the common methods of the house , and to second a motion which I do not expect that any will oppose .


[ Here the whole assembly cried out , with a general acclamation , ONSLOW , ONSLOW . ]


Mr. ONSLOW then rose up and said : -- Though I might allege many reasons against this choice , of which the strongest is my inability to discharge the trust conferred upon me in a manner suitable to its importance , yet I have too high an idea of the wisdom of this assembly , to imagine that they form any resolution without just motives  and therefore shall think it my duty to comply with their determination , however opposite to my own opinion .


Mr. PELHAM and Mr. CLUTTERBUCK then led him to the chair , where , before he went up to it , he desired , That the house would consider how little he was qualified for the office which they were about to confer upon him , and fix their choice upon some other person , who might be capable of discharging so important a trust .


The members calling out , The chair , chair , chair , he ascended the step , and then addressed himself thus to the house : -- Gentlemen , since it is your resolution , that I should once more receive the honour of being exalted to this important office , for which it is not necessary to mention how little I am qualified , since I may hope that those defects which have hitherto been excused , will still find the same indulgence  my gratitude for a distinction so little deserved , will always incite me to consult the honour of the house , and enable me to supply , by duty and diligence , what is wanting in my knowledge and capacity .


DECEMBER 4 , 1741 .


[ DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS . ]


The king came again to the house of lords , and the commons being sent for , his majesty approved their choice of a president , and made a speech to both houses , in which he represented to them , That their counsel was in a particular manner necessary , as they were engaged in a war with Spain , as the affairs of all Europe were in confusion , by the confederacy of many formidable powers for the destruction of the house of Austria  that both houses of the preceding session had come to the strongest resolutions in favour of the queen of Hungary , but that the other powers who were equally engaged to support her , had not yet acted according to their stipulations  that he had endeavoured to assist her ever since the death of the emperour Charles , and hoped that a just sense of common danger would induce other nations to unite with him  but that in this uncertain situation , it was necessary that Britain should be in a condition of supporting itself and its allies , as any exigency might require .
He therefore ordered the estimates for the ensuing year to be laid before the commons .
-- This speech being under the consideration of the house of lords , lord MILTON spoke in the following manner :


My lords , though the present perplexity of our affairs , the contrariety of opinions produced by it , and the warmth with which each opinion will probably be supported , might justly discourage me from proposing any of my sentiments to this great assembly , yet I can not repress my inclination to offer a motion , in my opinion , regular and seasonable , and which , if it should appear otherwise to your lordships , will , I hope , though it should not be received , at least be forgiven , because I have never before wearied your patience , or interrupted or retarded your consultations .


But I am very far from imagining that by this motion I can give any occasion to debate or opposition , because I shall propose no innovation in the principles , or alteration of the practice of this assembly , nor intend any thing more than to lay before your lordships my opinion of the manner in which it may be proper to address his majesty .


To return him our humble thanks for his most gracious speech from the throne , and , at the same time , to present unto his majesty our sincere and joyful congratulations on his safe and happy return into this empire .


To observe with the utmost thankfulness the great concern which his majesty has been pleased to express for carrying on the just and necessary war against Spain , which we hope , by the divine blessing upon his majesty 's arms , will be attended with success equal to the justice of his cause , and the ardent wishes of his people .
That ,


His majesty has so truly represented the impending dangers to which Europe is exposed , in the present critical conjuncture , as must awaken , in every one , an attention suitable to the occasion : and we can not but be fully sensible of the evil consequences arising from the designs and enterprises , formed and carrying on for the subversion or reduction of the house of Austria , which threaten such apparent mischiefs to the common cause .


To acknowledge his imperial goodness in expressing so earnest a desire to receive , and so high a regard for , the advice of his parliament : his majesty , secure of the loyalty and affections of his people , may rely upon that , with the best-grounded confidence  and to assure his majesty , that we will not fail to take the important points , which he has been pleased to mention to us , into our most serious consideration  and , in the most dutiful manner , to offer to his majesty such advice as shall appear to us to be most conducive to the honour and true interest of his crown and kingdoms .
To assure his majesty that we have a due sense , how much the present posture of affairs calls upon us for that unanimity , vigour , and despatch , which his majesty has so wisely recommended to us  and to give his majesty the strongest assurances , that we will vigorously and heartily concur in all just and necessary measures for the defence and support of his majesty , the maintenance of the balance and liberties of Europe , and the assistance of our allies .


That as duty and affection to his majesty are , in us , fixed and unalterable principles , so we feel the impressions of them , at this time , so strong and lively in our breasts , that we can not omit to lay hold on this opportunity of approaching his imperial presence , to renew the most sincere professions of our constant and inviolable fidelity : and to promise his majesty , that we will , at the hazard of all that is dear to us , exert ourselves for the defence and preservation of his sacred person and government , and the maintenance of the protestant succession in his imperial house , on which the continuance of the protestant religion , and the liberties of Britain , do , under God , depend .


My lords , as this address will not obstruct any future inquiries , by any approbation of past measures , either positive or implied , I doubt not but your lordships will readily concur in it , and am persuaded , that it will confirm his majesty 's regard for our councils , and confidence in our loyalty .


Lord LOVEL spoke next , to this effect : -- My lords , the dangers which have been justly represented by his majesty , ought to remind us of the importance of unusual circumspection in our conduct , and deter us from any innovations , of which we may not foresee the consequences , at a time when there may be no opportunity of repairing any miscarriage , or correcting any mistake .


There appears , my lords , not to be at this time any particular reason for changing the form of our addresses , no privileges of our house have been invaded , nor any designs formed against the publick .
His majesty has evidently not deviated from the practice of the wisest and most beloved of our British monarchs  he has , upon this emergence of unexpected difficulties , summoned the senate to counsel and assist him  and surely it will not be consistent with the wisdom of this house to increase the present perplexity of our affairs , by new embarrassments , which may be easily imagined likely to arise from an address different from those which custom has established .


The prospect which now lies before us , a prospect which presents us only with dangers , distraction , invasions , and revolutions , ought to engage our attentions , without leaving us at leisure for disputations upon ceremonies or forms .
It ought to be the care of every lord in this house , not how to address , but how to advise his majesty  how to assist the councils of the publick , and contribute to such determinations , as may avert the calamities that impend over mankind , and stop the wild excursions of power and ambition .


We ought to reflect , my lords , that the expectations of all Europe are raised by the convocation of this assembly  and that from our resolutions , whole nations are waiting for their sentence .
And how will mankind be disappointed when they shall hear , that instead of declaring war upon usurpers , or imposing peace on the disturbers of mankind , instead of equipping navies to direct the course of commerce , or raising armies to regulate the state of the continent , we met here in a full assembly , and disagreed upon the form of an address .


Let us , therefore , my lords , lay aside , at least for this time , all petty debates and minute inquiries , and engage all in the great attempt of reestablishing quiet in the world , and settling the limits of the kingdoms of Europe .


Then lord CARTERET spoke , in substance as follows : -- My lords , there is , I find , at least one point upon which it is probable that those will now agree whose sentiments have hitherto been , on almost every occasion , widely different .
The danger of our present situation is generally allowed  but the consequences deduced from it are so contrary to each other , as give little hopes of that unanimity which times of danger particularly require .


It is alleged by the noble lord who spoke last , that since we are now involved in difficulties , we ought only to inquire how to extricate ourselves , and , therefore , ought not to leave ourselves the right of inquiring how we were entangled in them , lest the perplexity of different considerations should dissipate our attention , and disable us from forming any useful determinations , or exerting any vigorous efforts for our deliverance .


But , in my opinion , my lords , the most probable way of removing difficulties , is to examine how they were produced , and , by consequence , to whom they are to be imputed  for certainly , my lords , it is not to be hoped that we shall regain what we have lost , but by measures different from those which have reduced us to our present state , and by the assistance of other counsellors than those who have sunk us into the contempt , and exposed us to the ravages of every nation throughout the world .


That this inquiry , my lords , may be free and unobstructed , it is necessary to address the throne , after the manner of our ancestors , in general terms , without descending to particular facts , which , as we have not yet examined them , we can neither censure nor approve .


It has been objected by the noble lord , that foreign nations will be disappointed by hearing , that instead of menaces of vengeance , and declarations of unalterable adherence to the liberties of Europe , we have wasted our time at this important juncture in settling the form of an address .


That little time may be wasted on this occasion , I hope your lordships will very speedily agree to an address suitable to the dignity of those who make it , and to the occasion upon which it is made  for I can not but allow , that the present state of affairs calls upon us for despatch : but though business ought , at this time , undoubtedly to be expedited , I hope it will not be precipitated  and if it be demanded that the most important questions be first determined , I know not any thing of greater moment than that before us .


How we shall gratify the expectations of foreign powers , ought not , my lords , to be our first or chief consideration  we ought , certainly , first to inquire how the people may be set free from those suspicions , which a long train of measures , evidently tending to impair their privileges , has raised  and how they may be confirmed in their fidelity to the government , of which they have for many years found no other effects than taxes and exactions , for which they have received neither protection abroad , nor encouragement at home .


But , my lords , if it be necessary to consult the inclinations , and cultivate the esteem of foreign powers , I believe nothing will raise more confidence in our allies , if there be any who are not now ashamed of that name , or more intimidate those whose designs it is our interest to defeat , than an open testimony of our resolution no longer to approve that conduct by which the liberty of half Europe has been endangered  and not to lavish praises on those men , who have in twenty years never transacted any thing to the real benefit of their country , and of whom it is highly probable that they have in the present war stipulated for the defeat of all our attempts , and agreed , by some execrable compact , to facilitate the exaltation of the house of Bourbon .


Upon what facts I ground accusations so atrocious may justly be inquired by your lordships  nor shall I find any difficulty in answering your demand .
For , if we extend our view over the whole world , and inquire into the state of all our affairs , we shall find nothing but defeats , miscarriages , and impotence , with their usual consequences , contempt and distrust .
We shall discover neither any tokens of that fear among our enemies , which the power of the nation , and the reputation of our former victories , might naturally produce  nor any proofs of that confidence among those whom we still continue to term our allies , which the vigour with which we have formerly supported our confederacies , give us a right to expect .
Those whom we once trampled , insult us  and those whom we once protected , give us no credit .


How reasonably , my lords , all nations have withdrawn from us their reverence and esteem , will appear by a transient examination of our late conduct , whether it regarded Europe in general , or influenced only the particular affairs of the British nation  for it will appear beyond possibility of doubt , that whoever has trusted the administration , whether their own country , or any foreign powers , has trusted only to be betrayed .


There is among our allies none whom we are more obliged to support than the queen of Hungary , whose rights we are engaged , by all the solemnities of treaties , to defend , and in whose cause every motive operates that can warm the bosom of a man of virtue .
Justice and compassion plead equally on her side , and we are called upon to assist her by our own interest , as well as the general duty of society , by which every man is required to prevent oppression .


What has been the effect of all these considerations may easily be discovered from the present state of the continent , which is ravaged without mercy by the armies of Spain and France .
Why all succours have been denied the queen of Hungary , and why the inveterate and hereditary enemies of our nation , are suffered to enlarge their dominions without resistance  why the rivals of our trade are left at full liberty to equip their squadrons , and the persecutors of our religion suffered to overrun those countries from whence only we can hope for assistance , when the hatred which the difference of opinions produces , shall threaten us with invasions and slavery , the whole world has long asked to no purpose , and , therefore , it is without prospect of receiving satisfaction that I engage in the same inquiry .


Yet , since it is our duty to judge of the state of the publick , and a true judgment can be the result only of accurate examination , I shall proceed , without being discouraged by the ill success of former attempts , to discover the motives of our late measures , and the ends intended to be produced by them .


Why the queen of Hungary was not assisted with land-forces , I shall , at present , forbear to ask  that she expected them is , indeed , evident from her solicitations  and , I suppose , it is no less apparent from treaties , that she had a right to expect them  nor am I able to conceive , why subsidies have been paid for troops which are never to be employed , or why foreign princes should be enriched with the plunder of a nation which they can not injure , and do not defend .


But I know , my lords , how easily it may be replied , that the expenses of a land war are certain , and the event hazardous , and that it is always prudent to act with evident advantage on our side , and that the superiority of Britain consists wholly in naval armaments .


That the fleets of Britain are equal in force and number of ships to the united navies of the greatest part of the world  that our admirals are men of known bravery , and long experience , and , therefore , formidable not only for their real abilities and natural courage , but for the confidence which their presence necessarily excites in their followers , and the terrour which must always accompany success , and enervate those who are accustomed to defeats  that our sailors are a race of men distinguished by their ardour for war , and their intrepidity in danger , from the rest of the human species  that they seem beings superiour to fear , and delighted with those objects which can not be named without filling every other breast with horrour  that they are capable of rushing upon apparent destruction without reluctance , and of standing without concern amidst the complicated terrours of a naval war , is universally known , and confessed , my lords , even by those whose interest it is to doubt or deny it .


Upon the ocean , therefore , we are allowed to be irresistible  to be able to shut up the ports of the continent , imprison the nations of Europe within the limits of their own territories , deprive them of all foreign assistance , and put a stop to the commerce of the world .
It is allowed that we are placed the sentinels at the barriers of nature , and the arbiters of the intercourse of mankind .


These are appellations , my lords , which , however splendid and ostentatious , our ancestors obtained and preserved with less advantages than we possess , by whom I am afraid they are about to be forfeited .
The dominion of the ocean was asserted in former times in opposition to powers far more able to contest it , than those which we have so long submissively courted , and of which we are now evidently afraid .


For that we fear them , my lords , they are sufficiently convinced  and it must be confessed , with whatsoever shame , that their opinion is well founded  for to what motive but fear can it be imputed , that we have so long supported their insolence without resentment , and their ravages without reprisals  that we have fitted out fleets without any design of dismissing them from our harbours , or sent them to the sea only to be gazed at from the shores , by those whose menaces or artifice had given occasion to their equipment , and in whom they raised no other emotions than contempt of our cowardice , or pity of our folly ?


To what , my lords , can it be attributed , that the queen of Hungary has yet received no assistance from allies thus powerful  from allies whose fleets cover the sea , whose commerce extends to the remotest part of the world , and whose wealth may be justly expected to be proportionate to their commerce .
To what can we ascribe the confidence with which the house of Bourbon threatens the ruin of a princess , who numbers among her allies the emperour of Britain ?


Nothing is more evident , my lords , than that the queen of Hungary has been disappointed of the advantages which she expected from her friendship with this nation , only by a degree of cowardice too despicable to be mentioned without such terms , as the importance of this debate , and the dignity of this assembly , do not admit  nor is it less certain , from the conduct of her enemies , that they knew what would be our measures , and confided for security in that cowardice which has never yet deceived them .


It can not , my lords , be asserted , that our ally , however distressed , has yet received the least assistance from our arms  neither the justice of our cause has yet been able to awaken our virtue , nor the inseparable union of her interest with our own , to excite our vigilance .


But , perhaps , my lords , we have had no opportunity of exerting our force  perhaps the situation both of our enemies and ally was such , that neither the one could be protected , nor the other opposed , by a naval power  and , therefore , our inactivity was the effect not of want of courage , but want of opportunity .


Though our ministers , my lords , have hitherto given no eminent proofs of geographical knowledge , or of very accurate acquaintance with the state of foreign countries , yet there is reason to believe that they must at some time have heard or read , that the house of Austria had territories in Italy  they must have been informed , unless their disbursements for secret service are bestowed with very little judgment , that against these dominions an army has been raised by the Spaniards  and they must have discovered , partly by the information of their correspondents , partly by the inspection of a map , and partly by the sagacity which distinguishes them from all past and present ministers , that this army was to be transported by sea from the coast of Spain to that of Italy .


This knowledge , my lords , however attained , might have furnished minds , which have always been found so fruitful of expedients , with a method of hindering the descent of the Spanish troops , for which nothing more was necessary than that they should have ordered admiral Haddock , instead of retiring before the Spanish fleet of war , and watching them only that they might escape , to lie still before Barcelona , where the transports were stationed , with a convoy of only three men of war , and hinder their departure .


I hope it will be observed by your lordships , that though the road of Barcelona is open and indefensible , though the fleet was unprotected by ships of force , and though they lay , as I am informed , beyond the reach of the guns on the fortifications upon the shore , I do not require that Haddock should have destroyed the army and the ships .


I am too well acquainted , my lords , with the lenity of our ministers to the enemies of their country , and am too well convinced of the prudence and tenderness of the restrictions by which the power of our admirals is limited , to expect that our guns should be ever used but in salutations of respect , or exultations on the conclusion of a peace .
I am convinced , that our ministers would shudder at the name of bloodshed and destruction , and that they had rather hear that a thousand merchants were made bankrupts by privateers , or all our allies deprived of their dominions , than that one Spanish ship was sunk or burnt by the navies of Britain .


But , my lords , though they are willing to spare the blood of their enemies , yet surely they might have obstructed their enterprises  they might have withheld those whom they were unwilling to strike , and have endeavoured to fright those whom they determined never to hurt .


To speak in terms more adapted to the subject before us : that the fleet of Spain , a fleet of transports with such a convoy , should lie three weeks in an open road , professedly fitted out against an ally united to us by every tie of nature , and of policy , by the solemnity of treaties , and conformity of interest  that it should lie undisturbed almost within sight of a British navy  that it should lie there not only without danger , but without apprehension of danger , has raised the astonishment of every nation in Europe , has blasted the reputation of our arms , impaired the influence of our counsels , and weakened the credit of our publick faith .


There may be some , my lords , that will impute this absurdity of our conduct , this disregard of our interest , this desertion of our alliances , and this neglect of the most apparent opportunities of success , not to cowardice , but treachery  a cause more detestable , as more atrociously criminal .


This opinion , my lords , I think it not necessary to oppose , both because it can not be charged with improbability , and because I think it may be easily reconciled with my own assertions  for cowardice abroad produces treachery at home , and they become traitors to their country who are hindered by cowardice from the prosecution of her interest , and the opposition of her enemies .


It may however be proper to declare , my lords , that I do not impute this fatal cowardice to those who are intrusted with the command of our navies , but to those from whom they are obliged to receive their instructions , and upon whom they unhappily depend for the advancement of their fortunes .


It is at least reasonable to impute miscarriages rather to those , who are known to have given , formerly , such orders as a brave admiral perished under the ignominious necessity of observing , than to those of whom it can not be said that any former part of their lives has been stained with the reproach of cowardice  at least it is necessary to suspend our judgment , till the truth shall be made apparent by a rigid inquiry  and it is , therefore , proper to offer an address in general terms , by which neither the actions or counsels of any man shall be condemned nor approved .


It would be more unreasonable to charge our soldiers or our sailors with cowardice , because they have shown , even in those actions which have failed of success , that they miscarried rather through temerity than fear  and that whenever they are suffered to attack their enemies , they are ready to march forward even where there is no possibility of returning , and that they are only to be withheld from conquest by obstacles which human prowess can not surmount .


Such , my lords , was the state of those heroes who died under the walls of Carthagena  that died in an enterprise so ill concerted , that I ventured , with no great skill in war , and without the least pretence to prescience , to foretell in this house that it would miscarry .


That it would , that it must miscarry  that it was even intended only to amuse the nation with the appearance of an expedition , without any design of weakening our enemies , was easily discovered  for why else , my lords , was the army composed of men newly drawn from the shop , and from the plough , unacquainted with the use of arms , and ignorant of the very terms of military discipline , when we had among us large bodies of troops long kept up under the appearance of a regular establishment  troops of whom we have long felt the expense , but of which the time is not , it seems , yet come , that we are to know the use .


These men , my lords , who have so long practised the motions of battle , and who have given in the park so many proofs of their dexterity and activity , who have at least learned to distinguish the different sounds of the drum , and know the faces and voices of the subaltern officers , at least , might have been imagined better qualified for an attempt upon a foreign kingdom , than those who were necessarily strangers to every part of the military operations , and might have been sent upon our first declaration of war , while the new-raised forces acquired at home the same arts under the same inspection .


But , my lords , whether it was imagined that new forces would be long before they learned the implicit obedience necessary to a soldier  whether it was imagined that it would not be easy on a sudden to collect troops of men so tall and well proportioned , or so well skilled in the martial arts of curling and powdering their hair  or whether it would have been dangerous to have deprived the other house of the counsels and votes of many worthy members , who had at the same time a seat in the senate , and a commission in the army , it was thought necessary to send out raw forces to attack our enemies , and to keep our disciplined troops at home to awe the nation .


Nor did the minister , my lords , think it sufficient to obstruct the expedition to America by employing new-raised troops , unless they were likewise placed under the command of a man , who , though of undoubted courage , was , with respect to the conduct of an army , as ignorant as themselves .
It was therefore determined , my lords , that all those officers who had gained experience in former wars , and purchased military knowledge by personal danger , should be disappointed and rejected for the sake of advancing a man , who , as he had less skill , was less likely to be successful , and was , therefore , more proper to direct an expedition proposed only to intimidate the British nation .


That the event was such as might be expected from the means , your lordships need not to be informed , nor can it be questioned with what intentions these means were contrived .


I am very far , my lords , from charging our ministers with ignorance , or upbraiding them with mistakes on this occasion , for their whole conduct has been uniform , and all their schemes consistent with each other : nor do I doubt their knowledge of the consequence of their measures , so far as it was to be foreseen by human prudence .


Whether they have carried on negotiations , or made war  whether they have conducted our own affairs , or those of our ally the queen of Hungary , they have still discovered the same intention , and promoted it by the same means .
They have suffered the Spanish fleets to sail first for supplies from one port to another , and then from the coasts of Spain to those of America .
They have permitted the Spaniards , without opposition , to land in Italy , when it was not necessary even to withhold them from it by any actual violence  for had the fleet , my lords , been under my command , I would have only sent the Spanish admiral a prohibition to sail , and am sure it would have been observed .


They have neglected to purchase the friendship of the king of Prussia , which might , perhaps , have been obtained upon easy terms , but which they ought to have gained at whatever rate  and , to conclude , we have been lately informed that the neutrality is signed .


Such , my lords , is the conduct of the ministry , by which it can not be denied that we are involved in many difficulties , and exposed to great contempt  but from this contempt we may recover , and disentangle ourselves from these difficulties , by a vigorous prosecution of measures opposite to those by which we have been reduced to our present state .


If we consider , without that confusion which fear naturally produces , the circumstances of our affairs , it will appear that we have opportunities in our hands of recovering our losses , and reestablishing our reputation  those losses which have been suffered while we had two hundred ships of war at sea , which have permitted three hundred merchant-ships to be taken  and that reputation which has been destroyed when there was no temptation either to a compliance with our enemies , or to a desertion of our friends .


It is well known , my lords , that we make war at present rather with the queen than the people of Spain  and it is reasonable to conclude , that a war carried on contrary to the general good , and against the general opinion , can not be lasting .


It is certain that the Spaniards , whenever they have been attacked by men acquainted with the science of war , and furnished with necessary stores for hostile attempts , have discovered either ignorance or cowardice , and have either fled meanly , or resisted unskilfully .


It is , therefore , probable , my lords , that either our enemies will desist from the prosecution of a war , which few of them approve  or that we shall , by vigorous descents upon their coasts , and their colonies , the interruption of their trade , and the diminution of their forces , soon compel them to receive peace upon our own terms .


But these advantages , my lords , are only to be expected from a change of conduct , which change can never be produced by a seeming approbation of the past measures .
I am therefore of opinion , that we ought to address the throne in general terms , according to the ancient practice of this house .


In considering the address proposed , I can not but conclude that it is too much diffused , and that it would be more forcible if it was more concise : to shorten it will be no difficult task , by the omission of all the clauses that correspond with particular parts of his majesty 's speech , which I can not discover the necessity of repeating .


In the congratulation to his majesty upon his return to his once glorious dominions , no lord shall concur more readily or more zealously than myself  nor shall I even deny to extend my compliments to the ministry , when it shall appear that they deserve them  but I am never willing to be lavish of praise , because it becomes less valuable by being prodigally bestowed  and on occasions so important as this , I can never consent to praise before I have examined , because inquiry comes too late after approbation .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY rose next , and spoke to this effect : -- My lords , if the dangers that threaten our happiness and our safety be such as they have been represented  if ambition has extended her power almost beyond a possibility of resistance , and oppression , elated with success , begins to design no less than the universal slavery of mankind  if the powers of Europe stand aghast at the calamities which hang over them , and listen with helpless confusion to that storm which they can neither avoid nor resist , how ought our conduct to be influenced by this uncommon state of affairs ?
Ought we not to catch the alarm while it is possible to make preparation against the danger ?
Ought we not to improve , with the utmost diligence , the important interval ?
to unite our counsels for the protection of liberty , and exert all our influence against the common enemies of society , the unwearied disturbers of the tranquillity of mankind ?


To what purpose , my lords , are the miseries that the present distractions of Europe may bring upon us , so pathetically described , and so accurately enumerated , if they are to produce no effect upon our counsels ?
And what effect can be wished from them , but unanimity , with that vigour and despatch which are its natural consequences , and that success with which steadiness and expedition are generally rewarded ?


It might be hoped , my lords , that those who have so clear a view of our present embarrassments , and whose sagacity and acuteness expose them to a sensibility of future miseries , perhaps more painful than would be excited by any present and real calamities , should not be thus tortured to no purpose .
Every passion , my lords , has its proper object by which it may be laudably gratified , and every disposition of mind may be directed to useful ends .
The true use of that foresight of future events , with which some great capacities are so eminently endowed , is that of producing caution and suggesting expedients .
What advantage , my lords , would it be to navigators , that their pilot could , by any preternatural power , discover sands or rocks , if he was too negligent or too stubborn to turn the vessel out of the danger ?


Or how , my lords , to pursue the comparison , would that pilot be treated by the crew , who , after having informed them of their approach to a shoal or whirlpool , and set before them , with all his rhetorick , the horrours of a shipwreck , should , instead of directing them to avoid destruction , and assisting their endeavours for their common safety , amuse them with the miscarriages of past voyages , and the blunders and stupidity of their former pilot ?


Whether any parallel can be formed between such ill-timed satire , and wild misconduct , and the manner in which your lordships have been treated on this occasion , it is not my province to determine .
Nor have I any other design than to show that the only proper conduct in time of real danger , is preparation against it  and that wit and eloquence themselves , if employed to any other purpose , lose their excellence , because they lose their propriety .


It does not appear , my lords , that the address now proposed includes any approbation of past measures , and therefore it is needless to inquire , on this occasion , whether the conduct of our ministers or admirals deserves praise or censure .


It does not appear , my lords , that by censuring any part of our late conduct , however detrimental to the publick it may at present be imagined , any of our losses will be repaired , or any part of our reputation retrieved  and , therefore , such proceedings would only retard our counsels , and divert our thoughts from more important considerations  considerations which his majesty has recommended to us , and which can not be more strongly pressed upon us than by the noble lord who opposed the motion  for he most powerfully incites to unanimity and attention , who most strongly represents the danger of our situation .


Of the good effects of publick consultations , I need not observe , my lords , that they arise from the joint endeavour of many understandings cooperating to the same end  from the reasonings and observations of many individuals of different studies , inclinations , and experience , all directed to the illustration of the same question , which is , therefore , so accurately discussed , so variously illustrated , and so amply displayed , that a more comprehensive view is obtained of its relations and consequences , than can be hoped from the wisdom or knowledge of any single man .


But this advantage , my lords , can only be expected from union and concurrence  for when the different members of a national council enter with different designs , and exert their abilities not so much to promote any general purposes , as to obviate the measures , and confute the arguments of each other , the publick is deprived of all the benefit that might be expected from the collective wisdom of assemblies , whatever may be the capacity of those who compose them .
The senate thus divided and disturbed , will , perhaps , conclude with less prudence than any single member , as any man may more easily discover truth without assistance , than when others of equal abilities are employed in perplexing his inquiries , and interrupting the operations of his mind .


Thus , my lords , it might be safer for a nation , even in time of terrour and disorder , to be deprived of the counsels of this house , than to confide in the determinations of an assembly not uniform in its views , nor connected in its interests  an assembly from which little can be hoped by those who observe that it can not , without a tedious debate , prolonged with all the heat of opposition , despatch the first and most cursory part of publick business , -- an address to his majesty .


It has been for a long time a practice too frequent , to confound past with present questions , to perplex every debate by an endless multiplication of objects , and to obstruct our determinations by substituting one inquiry in the place of another .


The only question , my lords , now before us is , whether the address which the noble lord proposed , implies any commendation of past measures , not whether those measures deserve to be commended  which is an inquiry not at present to be pursued , because we have not now before us the means of attaining satisfaction in it , and which ought , therefore , to be delayed till it shall be your lordships ' pleasure to appoint a day for examining the state of the nation , and to demand those letters , instructions , and memorials , which are necessary to an accurate and senatorial disquisition .


In the mean time , since it is at least as expedient for me to vindicate , as for others to accuse those of whose conduct neither they nor I have yet any regular cognizance , and I may justly expect from the candour of your lordships , that you will be no less willing to hear an apologist than a censurer , I will venture to suspend the true question a few moments , to justify that conduct which has been so wantonly and so contemptuously derided .


That the preservation of the house of Austria , my lords , ought to engage the closest attention of the British nation , is freely confessed .
It is evident that by no other means our commerce , our liberty , or our religion can be secured , or the house of Bourbon restrained from overwhelming the universe .
It is allowed that the queen of Hungary has a claim to our assistance by other ties than those of interest  that it was promised upon the faith of treaties , and it is demanded by the loudest calls of honour , justice and compassion .
And did it not appear too juvenile and romantick , I might add , that her personal excellencies are such as might call armies to her assistance from the remotest corners of the earth  that her constancy in the assertion of her rights might animate every generous mind with equal firmness  and her intrepidity in the midst of danger and distress , when every day brings accounts of new encroachments , and every new encroachment discourages those from whom she may claim assistance from declaring in her favour , might inspire with ardour for her preservation all those in whom virtue can excite reverence , or whom calamities unjustly inflicted can touch with indignation .


Nor am I afraid to affirm , my lords , that the condition of this illustrious princess raised all these emotions in the court of Britain , and that the vigour of our proceedings will appear proportioned to our ardour for her success .
No sooner was the true state of affairs incontestably known , than twelve thousand auxiliary troops were hired , and commanded to march to her assistance , but her affairs making it more eligible for her to employ her own subjects in her defence , and the want of money being the only obstacle that hindered her from raising armies proportioned to those of her enemies , she required , that instead of troops , a supply of money might be sent her , with which his majesty willingly complied .


The British ministers in the mean time endeavoured , by the strongest arguments and most importunate solicitations , to animate her allies to equal vigour , or to procure her assistance from other powers whose interest was more remotely affected by her distress : if the effects of their endeavours are not yet manifest , it can not be imputed to the want either of sincerity or diligence  and if any other powers should be persuaded to arm in the common cause , it ought to be ascribed to the influence of the British counsels .


In the prosecution of the war with Spain , it does not appear , my lords , that any measures have been neglected , which prudence , or bravery , or experience , could be expected to dictate .
If we have suffered greater losses than we expected , if our enemies have been sometimes favoured by the winds , or sometimes have been so happy as to conceal their designs , and elude the diligence of our commanders , who is to be censured ?
or what is to be concluded , but that which never was denied , that the chance of war is uncertain , that men are inclined to make fallacious calculations of the probabilities of future events , and that our enemies may sometimes be as artful , as diligent , and as sagacious as ourselves ?


It was the general opinion of the British people , my lords , if the general opinion may be collected from the clamours and expectations which every man has had opportunities of observing , that in declaring war upon Spain , we only engaged to chastise the insolence of a nation of helpless savages , who might , indeed , rob and murder a defenceless trader , but who could only hold up their hands and cry out for mercy , or sculk in secret creeks and unfrequented coasts , when ships of war should be fitted out against them .
They imagined that the fortifications of the Spanish citadels would be abandoned at the first sound of cannon , and that their armies would turn their backs at the sight of the standard of Britain .


It was not remembered , my lords , that the greatest part of our trade was carried on in sight of the Spanish coasts , and that our merchants must be consequently exposed to incessant molestation from light vessels , which our ships of war could not pursue over rocks and shallows .
It was not sufficiently considered , that a trading nation must always make war with a nation that has fewer merchants , under the disadvantage of being more exposed to the rapacity of private adventurers .
How much we had to fear on this account was shown us by the late war with France , in which the privateers of a few petty ports , injured the commerce of this nation , more than their mighty navies and celebrated admirals .


My lords , it would very little become this august assembly , this assembly so renowned for wisdom , and for justice , to confound want of prudence with want of success  since on many occasions the wisest measures may be defeated by accidents which could not be foreseen  since they may sometimes be discovered by deserters , or spies , and sometimes eluded by an enemy equally skilful with ourselves in the science of war .


That any of these apologies are necessary to the administration , I am far from intending to insinuate , for I know not that we have failed of success in any of our designs , except the attack of Carthagena , of which the miscarriage can not , at least , be imputed to the ministry  nor is it evident that any other causes of it are to be assigned than the difficulty of the enterprise  and when , my lords , did any nation make war , without experiencing some disappointments ?


These considerations , my lords , I have thought myself obliged , by my regard to truth and justice , to lay before you , to dissipate those suspicions and that anxiety which might have arisen from a different representation of our late measures  for I can not but once more observe , that a vindication of the conduct of the ministry is by no means a necessary preparative to the address proposed .


The address which was so modestly offered to your lordships , can not be said to contain any more than a general answer to his majesty 's speech , and such declarations of our duty and affection , as are always due to our sovereign , and always expected by him on such occasions .


If our allies have been neglected or betrayed , my lords , we shall be still at liberty to discover and to punish negligence so detrimental , and treachery so reproachful to the British nation .
If in the war against Spain we have failed of success , we shall still reserve in our own hands the right of inquiring whether we were unsuccessful by the superiority of our enemies , or by our own fault  whether our commanders wanted orders , or neglected to obey them  for what clause can be produced in the address by which any of these inquiries can be supposed to be predetermined ?


Let us , therefore , remember , my lords , the danger of our present state , and the necessity of steadiness , vigour , and wisdom , for our own preservation and that of Europe  let us consider that publick wisdom is the result of united counsels , and steadiness and vigour , of united influence  let us remember that our example may be of equal use with our assistance , and that both the allies and the subjects of Great Britain will be conjoined by our union , and distracted by our divisions  and let us , therefore , endeavour to promote the general interest of the world , by an unanimous address to his majesty , in the terms proposed by the noble lord .


Lord TALBOT spoke in the following manner : -- My lords , after the display of the present state of Europe , and the account of the measures of the British ministers , which the noble lord who spoke against the motion has laid before you , there is little necessity for another attempt to convince you that our liberty and the liberty of Europe are in danger , or of disturbing your reflections by another enumeration of follies and misfortunes .


To mention the folly of our measures is superfluous likewise , for another reason .
They who do not already acknowledge it , may be justly suspected of suppressing their conviction  for how can it be possible , that they who can not produce a single instance of wisdom or fortitude , who can not point out one enterprise wisely concerted and successfully executed , can yet sincerely declare , that nothing has been omitted which our interest required ?


The measures , my lords , which are now pursued , are the same which for twenty months have kept the whole nation in continual disturbance , and have raised the indignation of every man , whose private interest was not promoted by them .
These measures can not be said to be rashly censured , or condemned before they are seen in their full extent , or expanded into all their consequences  for they have been prosecuted , my lords , with all the confidence of authority and all the perseverance of obstinacy , without any other opposition than fruitless clamours , or petitions unregarded .
And what consequences have they produced ?
What but poverty and distractions at home , and the contempt and insults of foreign powers ?
What but the necessity of retrieving by war the losses sustained by timorous and dilatory negotiations  and the miscarriages of a war , in which only folly and cowardice have involved us ?


Nothing , my lords , is more astonishing , than that it should be asserted in this assembly that we have no ill success to complain of .
Might we not hope for success , if we have calculated the events of war , and made a suitable preparation ?
And how is this to be done , but by comparing our forces with that of our enemy , who must , undoubtedly , be more or less formidable according to the proportion which his treasures and his troops bear to our own ?


Upon the assurance of the certainty of this practice , upon the evidence , my lords , of arithmetical demonstration , we were inclined to believe , that the power of Britain was not to be resisted by Spain , and therefore demanded that our merchants should be no longer plundered , insulted , imprisoned , and tortured by so despicable an enemy .


That we did not foresee all the consequences of this demand , we are now ready to confess  we did not conjecture that new troops would be raised for the invasion of the Spanish dominions , only that we might be reduced to the level with our enemies .
We did not imagine that the superiority of our naval force would produce no other consequence than an inequality of expense , and that the royal navies of Britain would be equipped only for show , only to harass the sailors with the hateful molestation of an impress , and to weaken the crews of our mercantile vessels , that they might be more easily taken by the privateers of Spain .


We did not expect , my lords , that our navies would sail out under the command of admirals renowned for bravery , knowledge , and vigilance , and float upon the ocean without design , or enter ports and leave them , equally inoffensive as a packet-boat , or petty trader .


But not to speak any longer , my lords , in terms so little suited to the importance of the question which I am endeavouring to clear , or to the enormity of the conduct which I attempt to expose  the success of war is only to be estimated by the advantages which are gained , in proportion to the loss which is suffered  of which loss the expenses occasioned by the war are always the chief part , and of which it is , therefore , usual , at the conclusion of a peace , for the conquered power to promise the payment .


Let us examine , my lords , in consequence of this position , the success of our present war against Spain  let us consider what each nation has suffered , and it will easily appear how justly we boast of our wisdom and vigour .


It is not on this occasion necessary to form minute calculations , or to compute the expense of every company of soldiers and squadron of ships  it is only necessary to assert , what will , I hope , not be very readily denied , even by those whom daily practice of absurd apologies has rendered impregnable by the force of truth , that such expenses as have neither contributed to our own defence , nor to the disadvantage of the Spaniards , have been thrown away .


If this be granted , my lords , it will appear , that no nation ever beheld its treasures so profusely squandered , ever paid taxes so willingly , and so patiently saw them perverted  for it can not , my lords , be proved , that any part of our preparations has produced a proportionate effect  but it may be readily shown how many fleets have been equipped only that the merchants might want sailors , and that the public stores might be consumed .


As to our ill success in America , which has been imputed only to the chance of war , it will be reasonable , my lords , to ascribe to other causes , so much of it as might have been prevented by a more speedy reinforcement of Vernon , or may be supposed to have arisen from the inexperience of our troops , and the escape of the Spaniards from Ferrol .


If our fleets had been sent more early into that part of the world , the Spaniards would have had no time to strengthen their garrisons  had our troops been acquainted with discipline , the attack would have been made with greater judgment  and had not the Spaniards escaped from Ferrol , we should have had no enemy in America to encounter .
Had all our ministers and all our admirals done their duty , it is evident that not only Carthagena had been taken , but that half the dominions of Spain might now have owned the sovereignty of the crown of Britain .


This , my lords , may be observed of the only enterprise , which it is reasonable to believe was in reality intended against the Spaniards , if even of this our ministers had not before contrived the defeat .
But of all the rest of our armaments it does not appear that any effect has been felt but by ourselves , it can not be discovered that they even raised any alarms or anxiety either in our enemies or their allies , by whom perhaps it was known that they were only designed as punishments for the merchants of Britain .


That our merchants have already been severely chastised for their insolence in complaining of their losses , and their temerity in raising in the nation a regard for its commerce , its honour , and its rights , is evident from a dreadful list of three hundred ships taken by the Spaniards , some of which were abandoned by their convoys , and others seized within sight of the coasts of Britain .


It may be urged , my lords , that the Spaniards have likewise lost a great number of vessels  but what else could they expect when they engaged in a war against the greatest naval power of the universe ?
And it is to be remembered , that the Spaniards have this consolation in their misfortunes , that of their ships none have been deserted by their convoys , or wilfully exposed to capture by being robbed of their crews , to supply ships of war with idle hands .


The Spaniards will likewise consider , that they have not harassed their subjects for the protection of their trade  that they have not fitted out fleets only to amuse the populace .
They comfort themselves with the hope , that the Britons will soon be reduced to a state of weakness below themselves , and wait patiently for the time in which the masters of the sea shall receive from them the regulation of their commerce and the limits of their navigation .


Nor can it be doubted , my lords , but that by adhering to these measures , our ministers will in a short time gratify their hopes  for whatsoever be the difference between the power of two contending nations , if the richer spends its treasures without effect , and exposes its troops to unhealthy climates and impracticable expeditions , while the weaker is parsimonious and prudent , they must soon be brought to an equality  and by continuing the same conduct , the weaker power must at length prevail .


That this has been hitherto the state of the war between Britain and Spain , it is not necessary to prove to your lordships  it is apparent , that the expenses of the Spaniards have been far less than those of Britain  and , therefore , if we should suppose the actual losses of war equal , we are only wearing out our force in useless efforts , and our enemies grow every day comparatively stronger .


But , my lords , let us not flatter ourselves that our actual losses have been equal  let us , before we determine this question , accurately compare the number and the value of our ships and cargoes with those of the Spaniards , and see on which side the loss will fall .


And let us not forget , what in all the calculations which I have yet seen on either part has been totally overlooked , the number of men killed , or captives in the British and Spanish dominions .
Men , my lords , are at once strength and riches  and , therefore , it is to be considered , that the most irreparable loss which any nation can sustain is the diminution of its people : money may be repaid , and commerce may be recovered  even liberty may be regained , but the loss of people can never be retrieved .
Even the twentieth generation may have reason to exclaim , How much more numerous and more powerful would this nation have been , had our ancestors not been betrayed in the expedition to Carthagena !


What loss , my lords , have the Spaniards sustained which can be put in balance with that of our army in America , an army given up to the vultures of an unhealthy climate , and of which those who perished by the sword , were in reality rescued from more lingering torments ?


What equivalent can be mentioned for the liberty of multitudes of Britons , now languishing in the prisons of Spain , or obliged by hardships and desperation to assist the enemies of their country ?
What have the Spaniards suffered that can be opposed to the detriment which the commerce of this nation feels from the detention of our sailors ?


These , my lords , are losses not to be paralleled by the destruction of Porto Bello , even though that expedition should be ascribed to the ministry .
These are losses which may extend their consequences to many ages , which may long impede our commerce , and diminish our shipping .


It is not to be imagined , my lords , that in this time of peculiar danger , parents will destine their children to maritime employments , or that any man will engage in naval business who can exercise any other profession  and therefore the death or captivity of a sailor leaves a vacuity in our commerce , since no other will be ready to supply his place .
Thus , by degrees , the continuance of the war will contract our trade , and those parts of it which we can not occupy , will be snatched by the French or Dutch , from whom it is not probable that they will ever be recovered .


This , my lords , is another circumstance of disadvantage to which the Spaniards are not exposed  for their traffick being only from one part of their dominions to another , can not be destroyed , but will , after the short interruption of a war , be again equally certain and equally profitable .


It appears , therefore , my lords , that we have hitherto suffered more than the Spaniards , more than the nation which we have so much reason to despise  it appears that our fleets have been useless , and that our troops have been only sent out to be destroyed  and it will , therefore , surely be allowed me to assert , that the war has not been hitherto successful .


I am , therefore , of opinion , my lords , that as the address now proposed , can not but be understood both by his majesty and the nation , to imply , in some degree , a commendation of that conduct which can not be commended , which ought never to be mentioned but with detestation and contempt , it will be unworthy of this house , offensive to the whole nation , and unjust to his majesty .


His majesty , my lords , has summoned us to advise him in this important juncture , and the nation expects from our determinations its relief or its destruction : nor will either have much to hope from our counsels , if , in our first publick act , we endeavour to deceive them .


It seems , therefore , proper to change the common form of our addresses to the throne , to do once , at least , what his majesty demands and the people expect , and to remember that no characters are more inconsistent , than those of a counsellor of the king , and a flatterer of the ministry .


Then lord ABINGDON spoke to this effect : -- My lords , I have always observed that debates are prolonged , and inquiries perplexed , by the neglect of method  and therefore think it necessary to move , That the question may be read , that the noble lords who shall be inclined to explain their sentiments upon it , may have always the chief point in view , and not deviate into foreign considerations .


[ It was read accordingly . ]


Lord CARTERET spoke next , to the purpose following : -- My lords , I am convinced of the propriety of the last motion by the advantage which it has afforded me of viewing more deliberately and distinctly the question before us  the consideration of which has confirmed me in my own opinion , that the address now proposed is only a flattering repetition of the speech , and that the speech was drawn up only to betray us into an encomium on the ministry  who , as they certainly have not deserved any commendations , will , I hope , not receive them from your lordships .
For what has been the result of all their measures , but a general confusion , the depression of our own nation and our allies , and the exaltation of the house of Bourbon ?


It is universally allowed , my lords , and therefore it would be superfluous to prove , that the liberties of Europe are now in the utmost danger  that the house of Bourbon has arrived almost at that exalted pinnacle of authority , from whence it will look down with contempt upon all other powers , to which it will henceforward prescribe laws at pleasure , whose dominions will be limited by its direction , and whose armies will march at its command .


That Britain will be long exempted from the general servitude , that we shall be able to stand alone against the whole power of Europe , which the French may then bring down upon us , and preserve ourselves independent , while every other nation acknowledges the authority of an arbitrary conqueror , is by no means likely , and might be , perhaps , demonstrated to be not possible .


How long we might be able to retain our liberty , it is beyond the reach of policy to determine , but as it is evident , that when the empire is subdued , the Dutch will quickly fall under the same dominion , and that all their ports and all their commerce will then be in the hands of the French , it can not be denied that our commerce will quickly be at an end .
We shall then lose the dominion of the sea , and all our distant colonies and settlements , and be shut up in our own island , where the continuance of our liberties can be determined only by the resolution with which we shall defend them .


That this , my lords , must probably , in a few years , be our state , if the schemes of the house of Bourbon should succeed , is certain beyond all controversy  and therefore it is evident , that no man to whom such a condition does not appear eligible , can look unconcerned at the confusion of the continent , or consider the destruction of the house of Austria , without endeavouring to prevent it .


But , my lords , though such endeavours are the duty of all who are engaged in the transaction of publick affairs , though the importance of the cause of the queen of Hungary be acknowledged in the speech to which we are to return an address , it does not appear that the ministers of Britain have once attempted to assist her , or have even forborne any thing which might aggravate her distress .


The only effectual methods by which any efficacious relief could have been procured , were that of reconciling her with the king of Prussia , or that of prevailing upon the Muscovites to succour her .


A reconciliation with the king of Prussia would have been my first care , if the honour of advising on this occasion had fallen to my lot .
To have mediated successfully between them could surely have been no difficult task , because each party could not but know how much it was their common interest to exclude the French from the empire , and how certainly this untimely discord must expose them both to their ancient enemy .


As in private life , my lords , when two friends carry any dispute between them to improper degrees of anger or resentment , it is the province of a third to moderate the passion of each , and to restore that benevolence which a difference of interest or opinion had impaired  so in alliances , or the friendships of nations , whenever it unhappily falls out that two of them forget the general good , and lay themselves open to those evils from which a strict union only can preserve them , it is necessary that some other power should interpose , and prevent the dangers of a perpetual discord .


Whether this was attempted , my lords , I know not  but if any such design was in appearance prosecuted , it may be reasonably imagined from the event , that the negotiators were defective either in skill or in diligence  for how can it be conceived that any man should act contrary to his own interest , to whom the state of his affairs is truly represented ?


But not to suppress what I can not doubt , I am convinced , my lords , that there is in reality no design of assisting the queen of Hungary  either our ministers have not yet recovered from their apprehensions of the exorbitant power of the house of Austria , by which they were frighted some years ago into the bosom of France for shelter , and which left them no expedient but the treaty of Hanover  or they are now equally afraid of France , and expect the pretender to be forced upon them by the power whom they so lately solicited to secure them from him .


Whatever is the motive of their conduct , it is evident , my lords , that they are at present to the unfortunate queen of Hungary , either professed enemies , or treacherous allies  for they have permitted the invasion of her Italian dominions , when they might have prevented it without a blow , only by commanding the Spaniards not to transport their troops .


To argue that our fleet in the Mediterranean was not of strength sufficient to oppose their passage , is a subterfuge to which they can only be driven by the necessity of making some apology , and an absolute inability to produce any which will not immediately be discovered to be groundless .


It is known , my lords , to all Europe , that Haddock had then under his command thirteen ships of the line , and nine frigates , and that the Spanish convoy consisted only of three ships  and yet they sailed before his eyes with a degree of security which nothing could have produced but a passport from the court of Britain , and an assured exemption from the danger of an attack .


It may be urged , that they were protected by the French squadron , and that Haddock durst not attack them , because he was unable to contend with the united fleets  but my lords , even this is known to be false : it is known that they bore no proportion to the strength of the British squadron , that they could not have made even the appearance of a battle , and that our commanders could have been only employed in pursuit and captures .


This , my lords , was well known to our ministers , who were afraid only of destroying the French squadron , and were very far from apprehending any danger from it  but being determined to purchase , on any terms , the continuance of the friendship of their old protectors , consented to the invasion of Italy , and procured a squadron to sail out , under pretence of defending the Spanish transports , that their compliance might not be discovered .


All this , my lords , may reasonably be suspected at the first view of their proceedings  for how could an inferiour force venture into the way of an enemy , unless upon security that they should not be attacked ?
But the late treaty of neutrality has changed suspicion into certainty , has discovered the source of all their measures , and shown that the invasion of Italy is permitted to preserve Hanover from the like calamity .


There is great danger , my lords , lest this last treaty of Hanover should give the decisive blow to the liberties of Europe .
How much it embarrasses the queen of Hungary , by making it necessary for her to divide her forces , is obvious at the first view  but this is not , in my opinion , its most fatal consequence .
The other powers will be incited , by the example of our ministry , to conclude treaties of neutrality in the same manner .
They will distrust every appearance of our zeal for the house of Austria , and imagine that we intend only an hypocritical assistance , and that our generals , our ambassadors , and our admirals , have , in reality , the same orders .


Nothing , my lords , is more dangerous than to weaken the publick faith .
When a nation can be no longer trusted , it loses all its influence , because none can fear its menaces , or depend on its alliance .
A nation no longer trusted , must stand alone and unsupported  and it is certain that the nation which is justly suspected of holding with its open enemies a secret intercourse to the prejudice of its allies , can be no longer trusted .


This suspicion , my lords , this hateful , this reproachful character , is now fixed upon the court of Britain  nor does it take its rise only from the forbearance of our admiral , but has received new confirmation from the behaviour of our ambassador , who denied the treaty of neutrality , when the French minister declared it to the Dutch .
Such now , my lords , is the reputation of the British court , a reputation produced by the most flagrant and notorious instances of cowardice and falsehood , which can not but make all our endeavours ineffectual , and discourage all those powers whose conjunction we might have promoted , from entering into any other engagements than such as we may purchase for stated subsidies .
For who , upon any other motive than immediate interest , would form an alliance with a power which , upon the first appearance of danger , gives up a confederate , to purchase , not a large extent of territory , not a new field of commerce , not a port or a citadel , but an abject neutrality !


But however mean may be a supplication for peace , or however infamous the desertion of an ally , I wish , my lords , that the liberty of invading the queen of Hungary 's dominions without opposition , had been the most culpable concession of our illustrious ministers , of whom it is reasonable to believe , that they have stipulated with the Spaniards , that they shall be repaid the expense of the war by the plunder of our merchants .


That our commerce has been unnecessarily exposed to the ravages of privateers , from which a very small degree of caution might have preserved it  that three hundred trading ships have been taken , and that three thousand British sailors are now in captivity , is a consideration too melancholy to be long dwelt upon , and a truth too certain to be suppressed or denied .


How such havock could have been made , had not our ships of war concluded a treaty of neutrality with the Spaniards , and left the war to be carried on only by the merchants , it is not easy to conceive  for surely it will not be pretended , that all these losses were the necessary consequence of our situation with regard to Spain , which , if it exposed the Portugal traders to hazard , did not hinder us from guarding our own coasts .


And yet on our own coasts , my lords , have multitudes of our ships been taken by the Spaniards  they have been seized by petty vessels as they were entering our ports , and congratulating themselves upon their escape from danger .


In the late war with France , an enemy much more formidable both for power and situation , methods were discovered by which our trade was more efficaciously protected : by stationing a squadron at the mouth of the Channel , of which two or three ships at a time cruized at a proper distance on the neighbouring seas , the privateers were kept in awe , and confined to their own harbours , or seized if they ventured to leave them .


But of such useful regulations in the present war there is little hope  for if the publick papers are of any credit , the king of Spain considers the captures of our merchants as a standing revenue , and has laid an indulto upon them as upon other parts of the Spanish trade .


It is , therefore , to little purpose that measures are proposed in this house , or schemes presented by the merchants for the preservation of our commerce  for the merchants are considered as the determined enemies of our minister , who therefore resolved that they should repent of the war into which he was forced by them , contrary to those favourite schemes and established maxims , which he has pursued till the liberties of mankind are almost extinguished .


There are , indeed , some hopes , my lords , that new measures , resolutely pursued , might yet repair the mischiefs of this absurd and cowardly conduct , and that by resolution and dexterity , the ambition of France might once more be disappointed .
The king of Prussia appears , at length , convinced that he has not altogether pursued his real interest , and that his own family must fall in the ruin of the house of Austria .
The king of Sardinia appears firm in his determination to adhere to the queen of Hungary , and has therefore refused a passage through his dominions to the Spanish troops .
The States of Holland seem to have taken the alarm , and nothing but their distrust of our sincerity can hinder them from uniting against the house of Bourbon .


This distrust , my lords , we may probably remove , by reviving , on this occasion , our ancient forms of address , and declaring at once to his majesty , and to all the powers of Europe , that we are far from approving the late measures .


There is another reason why the short addresses of our ancestors may be preferred to the modern forms , in which a great number of particular facts are often comprehended .
It is evident , that the addresses are presented , before there can be time to examine whether the facts contained in them are justly stated  and they must , therefore , lose their efficacy with the people , who are sufficiently sagacious to distinguish servile compliance from real approbation , and who will not easily mistake the incense of flattery for the tribute of gratitude .


With regard to the propriety of the address proposed to your lordships , which is , like others , only a repetition of the speech , there is , at least , one objection to it too important to be suppressed .


It is affirmed in the speech , in what particular words I can not exactly remember , that since the death of the late German emperour , the interest of the queen of Hungary has been diligently and invariably promoted  an assertion which his majesty is too wise , too equitable , and too generous to have uttered , but at the persuasion of his ministers .


His majesty well knows , that no important assistance has been hitherto given to that unhappy princess  he knows that the twelve thousand men , who are said to have been raised for the defence of the empire , those mighty troops , by whose assistance the enemies of Austria were to be scattered , never marched beyond the territory of Hanover , nor left that blissful country for a single day .
And is it probable that the queen would have preferred money for troops , had she not been informed that it would be more easily obtained ?


Nor was even this pecuniary assistance , though compatible with the security of Hanover , granted her without reluctance and difficulty  of which no other proof is necessary , than the distance between the promise and the performance of it .
The money , my lords , is not yet all paid , though the last payment was very lately fixed .
Such is the assistance which the united influence of justice and compassion has yet procured from the court of Britain .


Our ministers have been , therefore , hitherto , my lords , so far from acting with vigour in favour of the house of Austria , that they have never solicited the court of Muscovy , almost the only court now independent on France , to engage in her defence .
How wisely that mighty power distinguishes her real interest , and how ardently she pursues it , the whole world was convinced in her alliance with the late emperour  nor is it unlikely , that she might have been easily persuaded to have protected his daughter with equal zeal .
But we never asked her alliance lest we should obtain it , and yet we boast of our good offices .


Our governours thought it more nearly concerned them to humble our merchants than to succour our allies , and therefore admitted the Spaniards into Italy  by which prudent conduct they dexterously at once gratified the house of Bourbon , embarrassed the queen of Hungary , and endangered the effects of the British merchants , lying at Leghorn  effects which were lately valued at six hundred thousand pounds , but which , by the seasonable arrival of the Spaniards , are happily reduced to half their price .


I hope , therefore , I need not urge to your lordships the necessity of confining our address to thanks and congratulations , because it is not necessary to say how inconsistent it must be thought with the dignity of this house to echo falsehood , and to countenance perfidy .


Then the duke of NEWCASTLE spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , the manner in which the noble lord who spoke last expresses his sentiments , never fails to give pleasure , even where his arguments produce no conviction  and his eloquence always receives its praise , though it may sometimes be disappointed of its more important effects .


In the present debate , my lords , I have heard no argument , by which I am inclined to change the usual forms of address , or to reject the motion which has been made to us .


The address which has been proposed , is not , in my opinion , justly chargeable either with flattery to the ministers , or with disingenuity with respect to the people  nor can I discover in it any of those positions which have been represented so fallacious and dangerous .
It contains only a general declaration of our gratitude , and an assertion of our zeal  a declaration and assertion to which I hope no lord in this assembly will be unwilling to subscribe .


As an inquiry into the propriety of this address has produced , whether necessarily or not , many observations on the present state of Europe , and many animadversions upon the late conduct , it can not be improper for me to offer to your lordships my opinion of the measures which have been pursued by us , as well in the war with Spain , as with regard to the queen of Hungary , and to propose my conjectures concerning the events which may probably be produced by the distractions on the continent .


This deviation from the question before us , will at least be as easily pardoned in me as in the noble lords who have exhibited so gloomy a representation of our approaching condition , who have lamented the slavery with which they imagine all the states of Europe about to be harassed , and described the insolence and ravages of those oppressors to whom their apprehensions have already given the empire of the world .
For surely , my lords , it is an endeavour no less laudable to dispel terrour , than to excite it  and he who brings us such accounts as we desire to receive , is generally listened to with indulgence , however unelegant may be his expressions , or however irregular his narration .


That the power of the family of Bourbon is arrived at a very dangerous and formidable extent  that it never was hitherto employed but to disturb the happiness of the universe  that the same schemes which our ancestors laboured so ardently and so successfully to destroy , are now formed afresh , and intended to be put in immediate execution  that the empire is designed to be held henceforward in dependence on France  and that the house of Austria , by which the common rights of mankind have been so long supported , is now marked out for destruction , is too evident to be contested .


It is allowed , my lords , that the power of the house of Austria , which there was once reason to dread , lest it might have been employed against us , is now almost extinguished  and that name , which has for so many ages filled the histories of Europe , is in danger of being forgotten .
It is allowed , that the house of Austria can not fall without exposing all those who have hitherto been supported by its alliance , to the utmost danger  and I need not add , that they ought , therefore , to assist it with the utmost expedition , and the most vigorous measures .


It may be suggested , my lords , that this assistance has been already delayed till it is become useless , that the utmost expedition will be too slow , and the most vigorous measures too weak to stop the torrent of the conquests of France : that the fatal blow will be struck , before we shall have an opportunity to ward it off , and that our regard for the house of Austria will be only compassion for the dead .


But these , my lords , I hope , are only the apprehensions of a mind overborne with sudden terrours , and perplexed by a confused survey of complicated danger  for if we consider more distinctly the powers which may be brought in opposition to France , we shall find no reason for despairing that we may once more stand up with success in defence of our religion and the liberty of mankind , and once more reduce those troublers of the world to the necessity of abandoning their destructive designs .


The noble lord has already mentioned the present disposition of three powerful states , as a motive for vigorous resolutions , and a consideration that may , at least , preserve us from despair  and it is no small satisfaction to me to observe , that his penetration and experience incline him to hope upon the prospect of affairs as they now appear  because I doubt not but that hope will be improved into confidence , by the account which I can now give your lordships of the intention of another power , yet more formidable , to engage with us in the great design of repressing the insolence of France .


A treaty of alliance , my lords , has been for some time concerted with the emperour of Muscovy , and has been negotiated with such diligence , that it is now completed , and I doubt not but the last ratifications will arrive at this court in a few days  by which it will appear to your lordships , that the interest of this nation has been vigilantly regarded , and to our allies , that the faith of Britain has never yet been shaken .
It will appear to the French , that they have precipitated their triumphs , that they have imagined themselves masters of nations by whom they will be in a short time driven back to their own confines , and that , perhaps , they have parcelled out kingdoms which they are never likely to possess .


It was affirmed , and with just discernment , that applications ought to be made to this powerful court , as the professed adversary of France  and if it was not hitherto known that their assistance had been assiduously solicited , our endeavours were kept secret only that their success might be more certain , and that they might surprise more powerfully by their effects .


Nor have the two other princes , which were mentioned by the noble lord , been forgotten , whose concurrence is at this time so necessary to us : and I doubt not but that the representations which have been made with all the force of truth , and all the zeal that is awakened by interest and by danger , will in time produce the effects for which they were intended  by convincing those princes that they endanger themselves by flattering the French ambition , that they are divesting themselves of that defence of which they will quickly regret the loss , and that they are only not attacked at present , that they may be destroyed more easily hereafter .


But it is always to be remembered , my lords , that in publick transactions , as in private life , interest acts with less force as it is at greater distance , and that the immediate motive will generally prevail .
Futurity impairs the influence of the most important objects of consideration , even when it does not lessen their certainty  and with regard to events only probable , events which a thousand accidents may obviate , they are almost annihilated , with regard to the human mind , by being placed at a distance from us .
Wherever imagination can exert its power , we easily dwell upon the most pleasing views , and flatter ourselves with those consequences , which though perhaps least to be expected , are most desired .
Wherever different events may arise , which is the state of all human transactions , we naturally promote our hopes , and repress our fears  and in time so far deceive ourselves , as to quiet all our suspicions , lay all our terrours asleep , and believe what at first we only wished .


This , my lords , must be the delusion by which some states are induced to favour , and others to neglect the encroachments of France .
Men are impolitick , as they are wicked  because they prefer the gratification of the present hour to the assurance of solid and permanent , but distant happiness .
The French take advantage of this general weakness of the human mind , and by magnificent promises to one prince , and petty grants to another , reconcile them to their designs .
Each finds that he shall gain more by contracting an alliance with them , than with another state which has no view besides that of preserving to every sovereign his just rights , and which , therefore , as it plunders none , will have nothing to bestow .


This , my lords , is the disadvantage under which our negotiators labour against those of France  we have no kingdoms to parcel out among those whose confederacy we solicit  we can promise them no superiority above the neighbouring princes which they do not now possess  we assume not the province of adjusting the boundaries of dominion , or of deciding contested titles : we promise only the preservation of quiet , and the establishment of safety .


But the French , my lords , oppose us with other arguments , arguments which , indeed , receive their force from folly and credulity  but what more powerful assistance can be desired ?
They promise not mere negative advantages , not an exemption from remote oppression , or an escape from slavery , which , as it was yet never felt , is very little dreaded  they offer an immediate augmentation of dominion , and an extension of power  they propose new tracts of commerce , and open new sources of wealth  they invite confederacies , not for defence , but for conquests  for conquests to be divided among the powers by whose union they shall be made .


Let it not , therefore , be objected , my lords , to our ministers , or our negotiators , that the French obtain more influence than they  that they are more easily listened to , or more readily believed : for while such is the condition of mankind , that what is desired is easily credited , while profit is more powerful than reason , the French eloquence will frequently prevail .


Whether , my lords , our seeming want of success in the war with Spain admits of as easy a solution , my degree of knowledge in military affairs , does not enable me to determine .
An account of this part of our conduct is to be expected from the commissioners of the admiralty , by whom , I doubt not , but such reasons will be assigned for all the operations of our naval forces , and such vindications offered of all those measures , which have been hitherto imputed too precipitately to negligence , cowardice , or treachery , as will satisfy those who have been most vehement in their censures .


But because it does not seem to me very difficult to apologize for those miscarriages which have occasioned the loudest complaints , I will lay before your lordships what I have been able to collect from inquiry , or to conjecture from observation  and doubt not but it will easily appear , that nothing has been omitted from any apparent design of betraying our country , and that our ministers and commanders will deserve , at least , to be heard before they are condemned .


That great numbers of our trading vessels have been seized by the Spaniards , and that our commerce has , therefore , been very much embarrassed and interrupted , is sufficiently manifest  but to me , my lords , this appears one of the certain and necessary consequences of war , which are always to be expected , and to be set in our consultations against the advantages which we propose to obtain .
It is as rational to expect , that of an army sent against our enemies , every man should return unhurt to his acquaintances , as that every merchant should see his ship and cargo sail safely into port .


If we examine , my lords , the late war , of which the conduct has been so lavishly applauded , in which the victories which we obtained have been so loudly celebrated , and which has been proposed to the imitation of all future ministers , it will appear , that our losses of the same kind were then very frequent , and , perhaps , not less complained of , though the murmurs are now forgotten , and the acclamations transmitted to posterity , because we naturally relate what has given us satisfaction , and suppress what we can not recollect without uneasiness .


If we look farther backward , my lords , and inquire into the event of any other war in which we engaged since commerce has constituted so large a part of the interest of this nation , I doubt not but in proportion to our trade will be found our losses  and in all future wars , as in the present , I shall expect the same calamities and the same complaints .
For the escape of any number of ships raises no transport , nor produces any gratitude  but the loss of a few will always give occasion to clamours and discontent .
For vigilance , however diligent , can never produce more safety than will be naturally expected from our incontestable superiority at sea , by which a great part of the nation is so far deceived as to imagine , that because we can not be conquered , we can not be molested .


Nor do I see how it is possible to employ our power more effectually for the protection of our trade than by the method now pursued of covering the ocean with our fleets , and stationing our ships of war in every place where danger can be apprehended .
If it be urged , that the inefficacy of our measures is a sufficient proof of their impropriety , it will be proper to substitute another plan of operation , of which the success may be more probable .
To me , my lords , the loss of some of our mercantile vessels shows only the disproportion between the number of our ships of war , and the extent of the sea , which is a region too vast to be completely garrisoned , and of which the frequenters must inevitably be subject to the sudden incursions of subtle rovers .


The disposition of our squadrons has been such , as was doubtless dictated by the most acute sagacity , and the most enlightened experience .
The squadron which was appointed to guard our coasts has been ridiculed as an useless expense  and its frequent excursions and returns , without any memorable attempt , have given occasion to endless raillery , and incessant exclamations of wonder and contempt .
But it is to be considered , my lords , that the enemies of this nation , either secret or declared , had powerful squadrons in many ports of the Mediterranean , which , had they known that our coasts were without defence , might have issued out on a sudden , and have appeared unexpectedly in our Channel , from whence they might have laid our towns in ruin , entered our docks , burnt up all our preparations for future expeditions , carried into slavery the inhabitants of our villages , and left the maritime provinces of this kingdom in a state of general desolation .


Out of this squadron , however necessary , there was yet a reinforcement of five ships ordered to assist Haddock , that he might be enabled to oppose the designs of the Spaniards , though assisted by their French confederates , whom it is known that he was so far from favouring , that he was stationed before Barcelona to block them up .
Why he departed from that port , and upon what motives of policy , or maxims of war , he suffered the Spaniards to prosecute their scheme , he only is able to inform us .


That the Spaniards have not at least been spared by design , is evident from their sufferings in this war , which have been much greater than ours .
Many of our ships have , indeed , been snatched up by the rapacity of private adventurers , whom the ardour of interest had made vigilant , and whose celerity of pursuit as well as flight , enables them to take the advantage of the situation of their own ports , and those of their friends .
But as none of our ships have been denied convoys , I know not how the loss of them can be imputed to the ministry  and if any of those who sailed under the protection of ships of war have been lost , the commanders may be required to vindicate themselves from the charge of negligence or treachery .


But this inquiry , my lords , must be , in my opinion , reserved for another day , when it may become the immediate subject of our consultations , with which it has at present no coherence , or to which , at least , it is very remotely related .
For I am not able , upon the most impartial and the most attentive consideration of the address now proposed to your lordships , to perceive any necessity of a previous inquiry into the conduct of the war , the transaction of our negotiations , or the state of the kingdom , in order to our compliance with this motion , by which we shall be far from sheltering any crime from punishment , or any doubtful conduct from inquiry  shall be far from obstructing the course of national justice , or approving what we do not understand .


The chief tendency of his majesty 's speech is to ask our advice on this extraordinary conjuncture of affairs  a conduct undoubtedly worthy of a British monarch , and which we ought not to requite with disrespect  but what less can be inferred from an alteration of our established forms of address , by an omission of any part of the speech ?
For what will be imagined by his majesty , by the nation , and by the whole world , but that we did not approve what we did not answer ?


The duke of ARGYLE spoke to the following purpose : -- My lords , it is with great reason that the present time has been represented to us from the throne as a time of uncommon danger and disturbance , a time in which the barriers of kingdoms are broken down , in contempt of every law of heaven and of earth , and in which ambition , rapine , and oppression , seem to be let loose upon mankind  a time in which some nations send out armies and invade the territories of their neighbours , in opposition to the most solemn treaties , of which others , with equal perfidy , silently suffer , or secretly favour the violation .


At a time like this , when treaties are considered only as momentary expedients , and alliances confer no security , it is evident that the preservation of our rights , our interest , and our commerce , must depend only on our natural strength  and that instead of cultivating the friendship of foreign powers , which we must purchase upon disadvantageous conditions , and which will be withdrawn from us whenever we shall need it  we ought , therefore , to collect our own force , and show the world how little we stand in need of assistance , and how little we have to fear from the most powerful of our enemies .


Our country , my lords , seems designed by nature to subsist without any dependence on other nations , and by a steady and resolute improvement of these advantages with which providence has blessed it , may bid defiance to mankind  it might become , by the extension of our commerce , the general centre at which the wealth of the whole earth might be collected together , and from whence it might be issued upon proper occasions , for the diffusion of liberty , the repression of insolence , and the preservation of peace .


But this glory , and this influence , my lords , must arise from domestick felicity  and domestick felicity can only be produced by a mutual confidence between the government and the people .
Where the governours distrust the affections of their subjects , they will not be very solicitous to advance their happiness  for who will endeavour to increase that wealth which will , as he believes , be employed against him ?
Nor will the subjects cheerfully concur even with the necessary measures of their governours , whose general designs they conceive to be contrary to the publick interest  because any temporary success or accidental reputation , will only dazzle the eyes of the multitude , while their liberties are stolen away .


This confidence , my lords , must be promoted where it exists , and regained where it is lost , by the open administration of justice , by impartial inquiries into publick transactions , by the exaltation of those whose wisdom and bravery has advanced the publick reputation , or increased the happiness of the nation , and the censure of those , however elate with dignities , or surrounded with dependants , who by their unskilfulness or dishonesty , have either embarrassed their country or betrayed it .


For this reason , my lords , it is , in my opinion , necessary to gratify the nation , at the present juncture , with the prospect of those measures , without which no people can reasonably be satisfied  and to pacify their resentment of past injuries , and quiet their apprehensions of future miseries , by a possibility , at least , that they may see the authors of all our miscarriages called to a trial in open day , and the merit of those men acknowledged and rewarded , by whose resolution and integrity they imagine that the final ruin of themselves and posterity has been hitherto prevented .


That the present discontent of the British nation is almost universal , that suspicion has infused itself into every rank and denomination of men , that complaints of the neglect of our commerce , the misapplication of our treasure , and the unsuccessfulness of our arms , are to be heard from every mouth , and in every place , where men dare utter their sentiments , I suppose , my lords , no man will deny  for whoever should stand up in opposition to the truth of a fact so generally known , would distinguish himself , even in this age of effrontery and corruption , by a contempt of reputation , not yet known amongst mankind .


And indeed , my lords , it must be confessed that these discontents and clamours are produced by such an appearance of folly , or of treachery , as few ages or nations have ever known  by such an obstinate perseverance in bad measures , as shame has hitherto prevented in those upon whom nobler motives , fidelity to their trust , and love of their country , had lost their influence .


Other ministers , when they have formed designs of sacrificing the publick interest to their own , have been compelled to better measures by timely discoveries , and just representations  they have been criminal only because they hoped for secrecy , and have vindicated their conduct no longer than while they had hopes that their apologies might deceive .


But our heroick ministers , my lords , have set themselves free from the shackles of circumspection , they have disburdened themselves of the embarrassments of caution , and claim an exemption from the necessity of supporting their measures by laborious deductions and artful reasonings  they defy the publick when they can no longer delude it , and prosecute , in the face of the sun , those measures which they have not been able to support , and of which the fatal consequences are foreseen by the whole nation .


When they have been detected in one absurdity , they take shelter in another  when experience has shown that one of their attempts was designed only to injure their country , they propose a second of the same kind with equal confidence , boast again of their integrity , and again require the concurrence of the legislature , and the support of the people .


When they had for a long time suffered our trading vessels to be seized in sight of our own ports , when they had despatched fleets into the Mediterranean , only to lie exposed to the injuries of the weather , and to sail from one coast to another , only to show that they had no hostile intentions , and that they were fitted out by the friends of the Spaniards , only to amuse and exhaust the nation , they at length thought it necessary to lull the impatience of the people , who began to discover that they had hitherto been harassed with taxes and impresses to no purpose , by the appearance of a new effort for the subjection of the enemy , and to divert , by the expectations which an army and a fleet naturally raise , any clamours at their past conduct ' .


For this end , having entered into their usual consultations , they projected an expedition into America , for which they raised forces and procured transports , with all the pomp of preparation for the conquest of half the continent , not so much to alarm the Spaniards , which I conceive but a secondary view , as to fill the people of Britain with amusing prospects of great achievements , of the addition of new dominions to this empire , and an ample reparation for all their damages .


Thus provided with forces sufficient , in appearance , for this mighty enterprise , they embarked them after many delays , and dismissed them to their fate , having first disposed their regulations in such a manner , that it was impossible that they should meet with success .


I can call your lordships to witness , that this impossibility was not discovered by me after the event , for I foretold in this house , that their designs , so conducted , must evidently miscarry .


Nor was this prediction , my lords , the effect of any uncommon sagacity , or any accidental conjecture on future consequences which happened to be right  for to any man who has had opportunities of observing that knowledge in war is necessary to success , and experience is the foundation of knowledge , it was sufficiently plain that our forces must be repulsed .


The forces sent into America , my lords , were newly raised , placed under the direction of officers not less ignorant than themselves , and commanded by a man who never had commanded any troops before  and who , however laudable he might have discharged the duty of a captain , was wholly unacquainted with the province of a general .


Yet was this man , my lords , preferred , not only to a multitude of other officers , to whom experience must have been of small advantage , if it did not furnish them with knowledge far superiour to his , but to five and forty generals , of whom I hope the nation has no reason to suspect that any of them would not gladly have served it on an occasion of so great importance , and willingly have conducted an expedition intended to retrieve the honour of the British name , the terrour of our arms , and the security of our commerce .


When raw troops , my lords , with young officers , are to act under the command of an unskilful general , what is it reasonable to expect , but what has happened -- overthrow , slaughter , and ignominy ?
What but that cheap victories should heighten the insolence , and harden the obstinacy of our enemies  and that we should not only be weakened by our loss , but dispirited by our disgrace  by the disgrace of being overthrown by those whom we have despised , and with whom nothing but our own folly could have reduced us to a level .


The other conjecture which I ventured to propose to your lordships , with regard to the queen of Hungary , was not founded on facts equally evident with the former , though experience has discovered that it was equally true .
It was then asserted , both by other lords and myself , that money would be chosen by that princess as an assistance more useful than forces  an opinion , which the lords who are engaged in the administration vigorously opposed .
In consequence of their determination , forces were hired , for what purpose -- let them now declare , since none but themselves have yet known .


That at least they were not taken into our pay for the service for which they were required , the succour of the house of Austria , is most evident , unless the name of armies is imagined sufficient to intimidate the French , as the Spaniards are to be subdued by the sight of fleets .
They never marched towards her frontiers , never opposed her enemies , or afforded her the least assistance , but stood idle and unconcerned in the territories of Hanover  nor was it known that they existed by any other proof than that remittances were made for their pay .


Such , my lords , was the assistance , asked with so much solicitude , and levied with so much expedition , for the queen of Hungary  such were the effects of the zeal of our illustrious ministers for the preservation of that august house , to whose alliance we are perhaps indebted for the preservation of our religion and our liberties , and to which all Europe must have recourse for shelter from the oppression of France .


When this formidable body of men was assembled , my lords , and reviewed , they were perhaps found too graceful and too well sorted to be exposed to the dangers of a battle  and the same tenderness that has so long preserved our own forces from any other field than the park , might rescue them from the fatigues of accompanying the active hussars in their incursions , or the steady Austrians in their conflicts .


Whatever was the reason , my lords , it is certain that they have been reserved for other opportunities of signalizing their courage  and they slept in quiet , and fattened upon the wealth of Britain , while the enemies of our illustrious , magnanimous , and unfortunate ally , entered her territories without opposition , marched through them uninterrupted , and rather took possession than made conquests .


That in this condition of her affairs , the queen would refuse an offer of twelve thousand men  that when she was driven from one country to another , attended by an army scarcely sufficient to form a flying camp , she would not gladly have accepted a reinforcement so powerful , let those believe , my lords , who have yet never been deceived by ministerial faith .


The real designs of the ministry , my lords , are sufficiently obvious , nor is any thing more certain , than that they had , in requiring this mock assistance for the queen of Hungary , no other design than that of raising her expectations only to deceive them  and to divert her , by confidence in their preparations , from having recourse to more efficacious expedients , that she might become , without resistance , the slave of France .


For this purpose they determined to succour her with forces rather than with money , because many reasons might be pretended , by which the march of the forces might be retarded  but the money , my lords , when granted , must have been more speedily remitted .


At last the queen , weary with delays , and undoubtedly sufficiently informed of those designs , which are now , however generally discovered , confidently denied , desired a supply of money , which might be granted without leaving Hanover exposed to an invasion .
With this demand , which they had no pretence to deny , they have yet found expedients to delay their compliance .
For it does not appear that the whole sum granted has yet been paid  and it would well become those noble lords , whose offices give them an opportunity of observing the distribution of the publick money , to justify themselves from the suspicions of the nation , by declaring openly what has been remitted , and what yet remains to be disbursed for some other purpose .


Is it not , therefore , evident , my lords , that by promising assistance to this unhappy princess , the ministry intended to deceive her ?
That when they flattered her with the approach of auxiliary forces , they designed only to station them where they might garrison the frontiers of Hanover ?
And that when they forced her to solicit for pecuniary aid , they delayed the payment of the subsidy , that it might not be received till it could produce no effect ?


This , my lords , is not only evident from the manifest absurdity of their conduct upon any other supposition , but from the general scheme which has always been pursued by the man whose dictatorial instructions regulate the opinions of all those that constitute the ministry , and of whom it is well known , that it has been the great purpose of his life to aggrandize France , by applying to her for assistance in imaginary distresses from fictitious confederacies , and by sacrificing to her in return the house of Austria , and the commerce of Britain .


How then , my lords , can it be asserted by us , that the house of Austria has been vigilantly supported ?
How can we approve measures , of which we discover no effect but the expense of the nation ?
A double expense , produced first by raising troops , which though granted for the assistance of the Austrians , have been made use of only for the protection of Hanover , and by the grant of money in the place of these troops , which were thus fallaciously obtained , and thus unprofitably employed !


For what purpose these forces were in reality raised , I suppose no man can be ignorant , and no man to whom it is known can possibly approve it .
How then , my lords , can we concur in an address by which the people must be persuaded , that we either are deceived ourselves , or endeavour to impose upon them  that we either dare not condemn any measures , however destructive , or that , at least , we are in haste to approve them , lest inquiry should discover their tendency too plainly to leave us the power of applauding them , without an open declaration of our own impotence , or disregard for the welfare of the publick .


The complaints of the people are already clamorous , and their discontent open and universal  and surely the voice of the people ought , at least , to awake us to an examination of their condition .
And though we should not immediately condemn those whom they censure and detest , as the authors of their miseries , we ought , at least , to pay so much regard to the accusation of the whole community , as not to reject it without inquiry , as a suspicion merely chimerical .


Whether these complaints and suspicions , my lords , proceed from real injuries and imminent dangers , or from false accusations and groundless terrours , they equally deserve the attention of this house , whose great care is the happiness of the people : people equally worthy of your tenderness and regard , whether they are betrayed by one party or another  whether they are plundered by the advocates of the administration , under pretence of supporting the government , or affrighted with unreasonable clamours by the opponents of the court , under the specious appearance of protecting liberty .
The people , my lords , are in either case equally miserable , and deserve equally to be rescued from distress .


By what method , my lords , can this be effected , but by some publick assurance from this house , that the transactions of the nation shall no longer be concealed in impenetrable secrecy  that measures shall be no longer approved without examination  that publick evils shall be traced to their causes  and that disgrace , which they have hitherto brought upon the publick , shall fall for the future only upon the authors of them .


Of giving this assurance , and of quieting by it the clamours of the people  clamours which , whether just or not , are too formidable to be slighted , and too loud not to be heard , we have now the most proper opportunity before us .
The address which the practice of our ancestors requires us to make to his majesty , may give us occasion of expressing at once our loyalty to the crown , and our fidelity to our country  our zeal for the honour of our sovereign , and our regard for the happiness of the people .


For this purpose it is necessary that , as we preserve the practice of our ancestors in one respect , we revive it in another  that we imitate those in just freedom of language whom we follow in the decent forms of ceremony  and show that as we preserve , like them , a due sense of the regal dignity , so , like them , we know likewise how to preserve our own , and despise flattery on one side , as we decline rudeness on the other .


A practice , my lords , has prevailed of late , which can not but be allowed pernicious to the publick , and derogatory from the honour of this assembly  a practice of retaining in our address the words of the speech , and of following it servilely from period to period , as if it were expected that we should always adopt the sentiments of the court  as if we were not summoned to advise , but to approve , and approve without examination .


By such addresses , my lords , all inquiries may be easily precluded  for the minister by whom the speech is compiled , may easily introduce the most criminal transactions in such a manner , as that they may obtain the approbation of this house  which he may plead afterwards at our bar , when he shall be called before it , and either involve us in the disgrace of inconsistency , and expose us to general contempt , or be acquitted by our former suffrages , which it would be reproachful to retract , and yet criminal to confirm .


It is not necessary , my lords , on this occasion to observe , what all parties have long since acknowledged , when it did not promote their interest to deny it , that every speech from the throne is to be considered as the work of the minister , because it is generally written by him  or if composed by the king himself , must be drawn up in pursuance of the information and counsel of the ministry , to whom it is , therefore , ultimately to be referred , and may consequently be examined without any failure of respect to the person of the prince .


This ought , however , to be observed , my lords , that it may appear more plainly how certainly this practice may be imputed to the artifices of ministers , since it does not promote the honour of the prince , and manifestly obstructs the interest of the people  since it is a practice irrational in itself , because it is inconsistent with the great purpose of this assembly , and can , therefore , serve no other purpose than that of procuring indemnity to the ministers , by placing them out of the reach of future animadversion .


Let not , my lords , the uninterrupted continuance of this practice for some reigns be pleaded in its defence  for nothing is more worthy of the dignity of this house , than to prevent the multiplication of dangerous precedents .
That a custom manifestly injurious to the publick has continued long , is the strongest reason for breaking it , because it acquires every year new authority and greater veneration : if when a nation is alarmed and distracted , a custom of twenty years is not to be infringed , it may in twenty years more be so firmly established , that many may think it necessary to be supported , even when those calamities are incontestably felt , which , perhaps , now are only feared .


I shall , therefore , my lords , propose , that of the address moved for , all be left out but the first paragraph  it will then be more consistent with the honour of your lordships , with our regard for the people , and with our duty to the crown , and hope no lord will refuse his concurrence .


Lord HARDWICKE rose next , and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , upon an attentive consideration of the address now proposed , I am not able to discover any objections which can justly hinder the unanimous concurrence of this assembly , since there is not any proposition contained in it either dangerous or uncertain .


The noble lords who have opposed this motion with the most ardent vehemence , are very far from denying what is asserted in it  they readily grant that designs are concerted by many formidable powers against the house of Austria , and that the consequences of the ruin of that family must extend to the utmost parts of Europe , and endanger the liberties of Britain itself  that the power of France will then be without a rival , and that she may afterwards gratify her ambition without fear and without danger .


Nor is it , my lords , less obvious in itself , or less generally allowed , that this is a time which demands the most active vigour , the most invariable unanimity , and the most diligent despatch  that nothing can interrupt the course of our common enemies but the wisest counsels , and the most resolute opposition  and that upon our conduct at this great conjuncture may probably depend the happiness and liberty of ourselves , our allies , and our posterity .


All this , my lords , is allowed to be apparently and indisputably true  I am , therefore , at a loss to conceive what can be the occasion of the debate in which some of your lordships have engaged .
As the causes of the calamities which are said to threaten us are not assigned in the address , we shall leave ourselves at full liberty to charge them upon those who shall appear from future inquiries to deserve so heavy an accusation .


If the ministers of the court have , by any inconstancy in their measures , or folly in their negotiations , given an opportunity to the enemies of Europe to extend their influence , or endangered either our own interest , or that of our allies  if they have by oppression or negligence alienated from his majesty the affections of his people , or the confidence of his confederates , nothing that is contained in the address now before us can be produced by them in justification of their conduct , or secure them from accusation , censure , and punishment .


If the war , my lords , has been hitherto carried on with clandestine stipulations , or treacherous compacts  if our admirals have received orders to retire from the coast of Spain , only to give our enemies an opportunity of invading the dominions of the queen of Hungary , or have , without directions , deserted their stations , and abandoned the protection of our commerce and our colonies  we shall , notwithstanding this address , retain in our hands the privilege of inquiring into their conduct , and the power , if it be found criminal , of inflicting such penalties as justice shall require .


I know not , therefore , my lords , upon what motives the debate is continued , nor what objections they are which hinder our unanimity , at a time when all petty controversies ought to be forgot , and all nominal distinctions laid aside  at a time when general danger may justly claim general attention , and we ought to suspend the assertion of our particular opinions , and the prosecution of our separate interests , and regard only the opposition of France , the support of our allies , and the preservation of our country .


The noble lords who have offered their sentiments on this occasion , have very diffusely expatiated on the miseries that impend over us , and have shown uncommon dexterity and acuteness in tracing them all to one source , the weakness or dishonesty of the British ministry .


For my part , my lords , though , perhaps , I believe that many circumstances of the present distress are to be imputed to accidents which could not be foreseen , and that the conduct of the ministry , however sometimes disappointed of the effects intended by it , was yet prudent and sincere , I shall at present forbear to engage in their defence , because the discussion of a question so complicated must necessarily require much time , and because I think it not so useful to inquire how we were involved in our present difficulties , as by what means we may be extricated from them .


The method by which weak states are made strong , and by which those that are already powerful , are enabled to exert their strength with efficacy , is the promotion of union , and the abolition of all suspicions by which the people may be incited to a distrust of their sovereign , or the sovereign provoked to a disregard of his people .
With this view , my lords , all addresses ought to be drawn up , and this consideration will be sufficient to restrain us from any innovations at a time like this .


If it should be granted , my lords , that the ancient method were better adapted to the general intention of addresses , more correspondent to the dignity of this house , and liable to fewer inconveniencies than that which later times have introduced , yet it will not follow that we can now safely change it .


Nothing in the whole doctrine of politicks is better known , than that there are times when the redress of grievances , inveterate and customary , is not to be attempted  times when the utmost care is barely sufficient to avert extreme calamities , and prevent a total dissolution  and in which the consideration of lighter evils must not be suffered to interrupt more important counsels , or divert that attention which the preservation of the state necessarily demands .


Such , my lords , is the present time , even by the confession of those who have opposed the motion , and of whom , therefore , it may be reasonably demanded , why they waste these important hours in debates upon forms and words ?


For that only forms and words have produced the debate , must be apparent , even to themselves , when the fervour of controversy shall have slackened  when that vehemence , with which the most moderate are sometimes transported , and that acrimony , which candour itself can not always forbear , shall give way to reflection and to reason .
That the danger is pressing , and that pressing dangers require expedition and unanimity , they willingly grant  and what more is asserted in the address ?


That any lord should be unwilling to concur in the customary expressions of thankfulness and duty to his majesty , or in acknowledgments of that regard for this assembly with which he asks our assistance and advice , I am unwilling to suspect  nor can I imagine that any part of the opposition to this proposal can be produced by unwillingness to comply with his majesty 's demands , and to promise that advice and assistance , which it is our duty , both to our sovereign , our country , and ourselves , to offer .


That those , my lords , who have expressed in terms so full of indignation their resentment of the imaginary neglect of the queen of Hungary 's interest , have declared the house of Austria the only bulwark of Europe , and expressed their dread of the encroachments of France with emotions which nothing but real passion can produce , should be unwilling to assert their resolution of adhering to the Pragmatick sanction , and of defending the liberties of the empire , can not be supposed .


And yet , my lords , what other reasons of their conduct can be assigned either by the emperour , or the people , or the allies of Britain  those allies whose claim they so warmly assert , and whose merits they so loudly extol ?
Will it not be imagined in foreign courts , that the measures now recommended by the emperour , are thought not consistent with the interest of the nation ?
Will it not be readily believed , that we propose to abandon those designs of which we can not be persuaded to declare our approbation ?


What will be the consequence of such an opinion artfully propagated by France , and confirmed by appearances so likely to deceive , may easily be foreseen , and safely predicted .
The French will prosecute their schemes with fresh ardour , when they dread no longer any interruption from the only nation able to resist them  and it is well known , my lords , how often confidence , by exciting courage , produces success .


Nor , indeed , can the success of their endeavours , thus animated and quickened , be easily doubted , since the same appearances that encourage them will intimidate their enemies .
Our allies will then think no longer of union against the general enemy  they must imagine their united force insufficient , and the only emulation amongst them will quickly be , which shall first offer his liberty to sale , who shall first pay his court to the masters of the world , and merit mercy by a speedy submission .


Thus , my lords , will the house of Austria , that house so faithful to Britain , and so steady in its opposition to the designs of the French ambition , be finally sunk in irrecoverable ruin , by those who appear to please themselves with declamations in its praise , and resolutions for its defence  and who never speak of the French without rage and detestation .


If on this occasion , my lords , we should give any suspicion of unusual discontent , what could be concluded but that we are unwilling any longer to embarrass ourselves with remote considerations , to load this nation with taxes for the preservation of the rights of other sovereigns , and to hazard armies in the defence of the continent ?
What can our allies think , but that we are at present weary of the burdensome and expensive honour of holding the balance of power in our hands , are content to resign the unquiet province of the arbiters of Europe , and propose to confine our care henceforward to our immediate interest , and shut up ourselves in our own island ?


That this is the real design of any of those noble lords who have opposed the motion , I do not intend to insinuate  for I doubt not but they believe the general interest both of this nation and its allies , most likely to be promoted by the method of address which they recommend , since they declare that they do not think our state desperate , and confess the importance of the affairs on which we are required by his majesty to deliberate , to be such , that nothing ought to repress our endeavours but impossibility of success .


Such is the knowledge and experience of those noble lords , that the hopes which I had formed of seeing the destructive attempts of the French once more defeated , and power restored again to that equipoise which is necessary to the continuance of tranquillity and happiness , have received new strength from their concurrence , and I shall now hear with less solicitude the threats of France .


That the French , my lords , are not invincible , the noble duke who spoke last has often experienced  nor is there any reason for imagining that they are now more formidable than when we encountered them in the fields of Blenheim and Ramillies .
Nothing is requisite but a firm union among those princes who are immediately in danger from their encroachments , to reduce them to withdraw their forces from the countries of their neighbours , and quit , for the defence of their own territories , their schemes of bestowing empires , and dividing dominions .


That such an union is now cultivated , we have been informed by his majesty , whose endeavours will probably be successful , however they may at first be thwarted and obstructed  because the near approach of danger will rouse those whom avarice has stupified , or negligence intoxicated  thus truth and reason will become every day more powerful , and sophistry and artifice be in time certainly detected .


When , therefore , my lords , we are engaged in consultations which may affect the liberties of a great part of mankind , and by which our posterity to many ages may be made happy or miserable  when the daily progress of the enemies of justice and of freedom ought to awaken us to vigilance and expedition , and there are yet just hopes that diligence and firmness may preserve us from ruin , let us not waste our time in unnecessary debates , and keep the nations of Europe in suspense by the discussion of a question , the decision of which may be delayed for years , without any manifest inconvenience .
Let us not embarrass his majesty by an unusual form of address , at a time when he his negotiating alliances , and forming plans for the rescue of the empire .


Nothing , my lords , is more remote from the real end of addresses , than a representation of them as made only to the minister  for if there be any commerce between a prince and his subjects , in which he is the immediate agent , if his personal dignity be interested in any act of government , I think it is not to be denied , that in receiving the addresses of the two houses , he assumes a peculiar and distinct character , which can not be confounded with his council or ministry .


The duke of ARGYLE rose again , and spoke to this effect : -- My lords , if there was now any contest amongst us for superiority of regard to his majesty , of zeal for his honour , or reverence of his person , I should not doubt of proving that no lord in this house can boast of more ardour , fidelity , or respect than myself  and if the chief question now amongst us related to the terms in which he deserves to be addressed by us , I should be unwilling that any man should propose language more submissive and reverend , or more forcible and comprehensive than myself .


But addresses , however they may for present purposes be represented as regarding the personal character of the king , are in reality nothing more than replies to a speech composed by the minister , whose measures , if we should appear to commend , our panegyrick may , in some future proceeding , be cited against us .
Every address , therefore , ought to be considered as a publick record , and to be drawn up , to inform the nation , not to mislead our sovereign .


The address now proposed , is , indeed , equally indefensible to whomsoever it may be supposed to relate .
If it respects the people , it can only drive them to despair  if it be confined to the sovereign , our advice , not our panegyrick , is now required , and Europe is to be preserved from ruin , not by our eloquence , but our sincerity .
Respect to his majesty , my lords , will be best shown by preserving his influence in other nations , and his authority in his own empire .
This can only be done by showing him how the one has been impaired , and how the other may be in time endangered .


By addresses like this which is now proposed , my lords , has his majesty been betrayed into an inadvertent appro bation of measures pernicious to the nation , and dishonourable to himself , and will now be kept ignorant of the despicable conduct of the war , the treacherous connivance at the descent of the Spaniards upon the dominions of the queen of Hungary , and the contempt with which every nation of the continent has heard of the neutrality lately concluded .
By addresses like this , my lords , have the rights of the nation been silently given up , and the invaders of liberty , and violators of our laws , preserved from prosecution  by such addresses have our monarchs been ruined at one time , and our country enslaved at another .


Lord HARRINGTON spoke next , in the following manner : -- My lords , it is necessary to explain that treaty of neutrality which has been mentioned by some lords as an act to the last degree shameful , an act by which the nation has been dishonoured , and the general liberties of Europe have been betrayed  a representation so distant from the truth , that it can only be imputed to want of information .


This treaty of neutrality , my lords , is so far from being reproachful to this nation , that it has no relation to it , being made by his majesty not in the character of emperour of Britain , but elector of Hanover , nor is any thing stipulated by it but security of the dominions of Hanover , from the invasion of the French for a single year .


What part of this transaction , my lords , can be supposed to fall under the cognizance of this assembly ?
Or with what propriety can it be mentioned in our debates , or produce an argument on either side ?
That the dominions of Britain and Hanover are distinct , and independent on each other , has often been asserted , and asserted with truth  and I hope those who so studiously separate their interest on all other occasions , will not now unite them only to reflect maliciously on the conduct of his majesty .


I do not , indeed , charge any lord with a design so malignant and unjust  having already asserted it as my opinion , that these reproaches were produced only by ignorance of the true state of the affair , but can not with equal readiness allow that ignorance to be wholly blameless .


It is necessary , my lords , in common life , to every man who would avoid contempt and ridicule , to refrain from speaking , at least from speaking with confidence , on subjects with which he has not made himself sufficiently acquainted .
This caution , my lords , is more necessary when his discourse tends to the accusation or reproach of another , because he can then only escape contempt himself by bringing it , perhaps unjustly , on him whom he condemns .
It is more necessary still , to him who speaks in the publick council of the nation , and who may , by false reflections , injure the publick interest  and is yet more indispensably required in him who assumes the province of examining the conduct of his sovereign .


Lord ISLAY spoke in substance as follows : -- ` My lords , it appears that all those who have spoke on either side of the present question , however they may generally differ in their opinions , agree at least in one assertion , that the time which is spent in this debate might be far more usefully employed , and that we , in some degree , desert the great cause of liberty , by giving way to trifling altercations .
This , indeed , is an argument of equal force for a concession on either side  but , as in affairs of such importance , no man ought to act in a manner contrary to the convictions of his own reason , it can not be expected that we should be unanimous in our opinions , or that the dispute should be determined otherwise than by the vote .


I have , indeed , heard no arguments against the motion , which require long consideration  for little of what has been urged , has , in my opinion , been very nearly connected with the question before us , which is not whether the ministers have pursued or neglected the interest of the nation , whether the laws have been violated or observed , the war timorously or magnanimously conducted , or our negotiations managed with dexterity or weakness , but whether we shall offer to his majesty the address proposed .


In this address , my lords , it has never yet been proved that any assertions are contained either false or uncertain in themselves , or contrary to the dignity of this assembly  that any act of cowardice or treachery , any crime , or any errour , will be secured by it from detection and from punishment .


That this , my lords , may appear more plainly , I move that the motion may be read  nor do I doubt but that the question will , by a closer examination , be speedily decided .


[ The motion being again read , in order to put the question . ]


Lord BATHURST spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , I know not why the noble lord should expect , that by reading the motion , a more speedy determination of the question would be produced  for if the repeated consideration of it operates upon the minds of the lords that have opposed it , in the same manner as upon mine , it will only confirm their opinion , and strengthen their resolution .


We are required , my lords , to join in an address of thanks to his majesty for his endeavours to maintain the balance of power  in an address , that implies a falsehood open and indisputable , and which will , therefore , only make us contemptible to our fellow-subjects , our allies , and our enemies .


What is meant , my lords , by the balance of power , but such a distribution of dominion , as may keep the sovereign powers in mutual dread of each other , and , by consequence , preserve peace  such an equality of strength between one prince , or one confederacy and another , that the hazard of war shall be nearly equal on each side ?
But which of your lordships will affirm , that this is now the state of Europe ?


It is evident , my lords , that the French are far from imagining that there is now any power which can be put in the balance against their own , and therefore distribute kingdoms by caprice , and exalt emperours upon their own terms .


It is evident , that the continuance of the balance of power is not now to be perceived by its natural consequences , tranquillity and liberty  the whole continent is now in confusion , laid waste by the ravages of armies , subject to one sovereign to-day , and to-morrow to another : there is scarcely any place where the calamities of war are not felt or expected , and where property , by consequence , is not uncertain , and life itself in continual danger .


One happy corner of the world , indeed , is to be found , my lords , secured from rapine and massacre , for one year at least , by a well-timed neutrality , of which , on what terms it was obtained , I would gladly hear , and whether it was purchased at the expense of the honour of Britain , though the advantages of it are confined to Hanover .


But as I am not of opinion , my lords , that the balance of power is preserved by the security of Hanover  or that those territories , however important , will be able to furnish forces equivalent to the power of France , I can not agree to promise , in an address of this house , to assist his majesty in maintaining the balance of power , though I shall cheerfully give my concurrence in every just and vigorous effort to restore it .


But , as it may be urged , that any direct expressions of discontent may be too wide a deviation from the common forms , which for a long time have admitted nothing but submission and adulation , I shall only venture to propose that we may , at least , contract our address , that if we do not in plain language declare all our sentiments , we may , however , affirm nothing that we do not think  and I am confident , that all the praises which can be justly bestowed on the late measures , may be comprised in a very few words .


It has been insinuated , that this change of our style may , perhaps , surprise his majesty , and raise in him some suspicions of discontent and disapprobation  that it may incline him to believe his measures , either not understood by us , or not applauded , and divert him from his present schemes , by the necessity of an inquiry into the reasons of our dislike .


And for what other purpose , my lords , should such a change of our style be proposed ?
Why should we deny on this occasion the encomiastick language which has been of late so profusely bestowed , but to show that we think this time too dangerous for flattery , and the measures now pursued , such as none but the most abject flatterers can commend ?


I should hope , that if it be asked by his majesty to what cause it is to be imputed , that the address of this house is so much contracted , there would be found some amongst us honest enough to answer , that all which can be said with truth is contained in it , and that flattery and falsehood were not consistent with the dignity of the lords of Britain .


I hope , my lords , some one amongst us would explain to his majesty the decency as well as the integrity of our conduct , and inform him that we have hinted our discontent in the most respectful manner  and where there was sufficient room for the loudest censure , have satisfied ourselves with modest silence , with a mere negation of applause .


Should we , my lords , in opposition to the complaints of our countrymen , to the representations of our allies , and all the conviction which our reason can admit , or our senses produce , continue to act this farce of approbation , what can his majesty conceive , but that those measures which we applaud , ought to be prosecuted as the most effectual and safe ?
And what consequence but total ruin can arise from the prosecution of measures , by which we are already reduced to penury and contempt ?


Lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke next to the following purpose : -- My lords , it is never without grief and wonder that I hear any suspicion insinuated of injustice or impropriety in his majesty 's measures , of whose wisdom and goodness I have so much knowledge , as to affirm , with the utmost confidence , that he is better acquainted than any lord in this assembly with the present state of Europe  so that he is more able to judge by what methods tranquillity may be reestablished  and that he pursues the best methods with the utmost purity of intention , and the most incessant diligence and application .


That the justest intentions may be sometimes defeated , and the wisest endeavours fail of success , I shall readily grant  but it will not follow , that we ought not to acknowledge that wisdom and integrity which is exerted in the prosecution of our interest , or that we ought not to be grateful for the benefits which were sincerely intended , though not actually received .


The wisdom of his majesty 's counsels , my lords , is not sufficiently admired , because the difficulties which he has to encounter are not known , or not observed .
Upon his majesty , my lords , lies the task of teaching the powers of the continent to prefer their real to their seeming interest , and to disregard , for the sake of distant happiness , immediate acquisitions and certain advantages .
His majesty is endeavouring to unite in the support of the Pragmatick sanction those powers whose dominions will be enlarged by the violation of it , and whom France bribes to her interest with the spoils of Austria  and who can wonder that success is not easy in attempts like this ?


In such measures we ought , doubtless , to endeavour to animate his majesty , by an address , at least not less expressive of duty and respect than those which he has been accustomed to receive  and , therefore , I shall concur with the noble lords who made and supported the motion .


[ The question , on a division , passed in the affirmative , Content , 89 .
Not Content , 43 . ]


IN PARLIAMENT .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , DECEMBER 8 , 1741 .


DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS .


The commons who attended in the house of lords , having heard his majesty 's speech to both houses , returned to their own house , where a copy of it being this day read to them by the speaker , Mr. H.A. HERBERT moved for an address , in words to this effect :


Sir , to address the throne on the present occasion , is a custom which , as it is founded on reason and decency , has always been observed by the commons of Britain  nor do I suspect this house of any intention to omit those forms of respect to his majesty , which our ancestors always preserved even under princes whose conduct and designs gave them no claim to reverence or gratitude .


To continue , therefore , sir , a practice which the nature of government itself makes necessary , and which can not but be acknowledged to be , in a peculiar degree , proper under a prince whose personal virtues are so generally known , I hope for the indulgence of this house in the liberty which I shall take of proposing an address to this effect :


That we should beg leave to congratulate his majesty , upon his safe and happy return to these his kingdoms , and to return our sincere thanks for his most gracious speech from the throne  and assure him at the same time , that with hearts full of duty and gratitude , we can not but acknowledge his majesty 's regard and attention to the honour and interest of this nation .
To observe that the great and impending dangers that threaten Europe , under the present critical and perplexed situation of affairs , have been represented by his majesty to his parliament , for their advice and assistance , with such paternal concern , and such affection to his people , such confidence in his faithful commons , and such anxiety for the general good of Europe , as can not fail to excite in us a due sense of his majesty 's goodness and condescension  and , therefore , to assure his majesty in the strongest manner , that this house will , as often as these momentous affairs shall come under our consideration , give his majesty such advice as becomes dutiful and faithful subjects , and such assistance and support as shall be most conducive to the honour and true interest of his crown and kingdoms .


That we thank his majesty for his royal care in prosecuting the war with Spain  and that in order to answer these necessary purposes , we will grant such effectual supplies , as shall enable his majesty , not only to be in a readiness to support his friends and allies , at such times and in such manner as the exigency and circumstances of affairs shall require , but to oppose and defeat any attempts that shall be made against his majesty , his crown and kingdoms , or against those , who being equally engaged with his majesty by the faith of treaties , or united by common interest and common danger , shall be willing to concert such measures as shall be found necessary and expedient for maintaining the balance of Europe .


This address , which in my opinion , will contain both a proper answer to his majesty 's speech , and a decent declaration of our gratitude and duty , will not , I hope , be opposed .
For surely it can not be charged with asserting any thing that is either false or mean , with bestowing any unnecessary panegyrick , or with maintaining any fact that is not generally allowed .


Mr. TREVOR seconded him in the manner following : -- Sir , as the necessity of an address to his majesty can not be disputed , the only question on this occasion must be , whether the address now proposed be such as it may become this house to offer in the present conjuncture of affairs .


In an address , sir , it is necessary to preserve at once the respect due to our sovereign , and the dignity which may justly be assumed by the representatives of the people of Britain , a people whose birthright gives them a claim to approach their sovereign , not , indeed , without the utmost respect , but with language , which absolute monarchs never hear from the slaves by whom they are surrounded .


This respect and dignity appear to me to be very happily united in the address now proposed , in which we join with our professions of duty , our offers of advice , and assert our claim to the direction of the national expenses by our promise to grant the necessary supplies .


As there can not , therefore , in my opinion , sir , be any thing added to the address now offered , and there appears to me no necessity of any alteration or omission , I second the motion .


Lord Noel SOMERSET spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , though I am far from intending to repress , by sophistical cavils , or trifling objections , the zeal which the honourable gentleman who proposed the address has shown for promoting the publick business , yet , as it is very inconsistent with the duty of a senator to prefer civility to truth , and to sacrifice to ceremony or complaisance the interest of his country , I think it necessary to declare my opinion , that though the address proposed may admit of many amendments , which I leave to other gentlemen to make , I think the addition of one clause absolutely necessary  that his majesty may be desired not to engage this nation in a war for the preservation of his foreign dominions  dominions which , as they are in themselves independent on the crown of Britain , and governed by different laws , and a different right , have been separated by an express clause from these kingdoms , in the act to which his majesty owes his title to the throne .


This request , sir , is at this time particularly expedient , when the continent is in confusion , and the territories of Hanover are endangered by the approach of the French forces .
Besides , as nothing is more fatal than groundless expectations of assistance , it may contribute to the safety of that people , to show them that they are to depend upon their own strength , to call their forces together , to fortify their towns , and guard their avenues  and that , if they sit indolent and careless , in confidence that the power of Britain will be employed in their defence , they will only give their enemies an easy conquest , and enslave themselves and their posterity to a foreign power : I move , therefore , that his majesty be petitioned in our address , not to engage these kingdoms in a war for the preservation of his foreign dominions .


Mr. SHIPPEN rose and spoke thus : -- Sir , I know not with what success I may assert , in this senate , positions , for which I have formerly been censured , and which few other members have hitherto maintained  but I rise with confidence that I shall be at least acknowledged to act consistently with myself in seconding the noble person who spoke last  and I am convinced , that many of those who differ from me in opinion , would gladly be able to boast of resembling me in congruity of principles , and steadiness of conduct .


But steadiness , sir , is the effect only of integrity , and congruity the consequence of conviction : he that speaks always what he thinks , and endeavours by diligent inquiry to think aright before he ventures to declare his sentiments  he that follows , in his searches , no leader but reason , nor expects any reward from them but the advantage of discovering truth , and the pleasure of communicating it , will not easily change his opinion , because it will seldom be easy to show that he who has honestly inquired after truth , has failed to attain it .


For my part , I am not ashamed nor afraid to affirm , that thirty years have made no change in any of my political opinions  I am now grown old in this house , but that experience which is the consequence of age , has only confirmed the principles with which I entered it many years ago  time has verified the predictions which I formerly uttered , and I have seen my conjectures ripened into knowledge .


I should be , therefore , without excuse , if either terrour could affright , or the hope of advantage allure me from the declaration of my opinions  opinions which I was not deterred from asserting , when the prospect of a longer life than I can now expect might have added to the temptations of ambition , or aggravated the terrours of poverty and disgrace  opinions for which I would willingly have suffered the severest censures , even when I had espoused them only in compliance with reason , without the infallible certainty of experience .


Of truth it has been always observed , sir , that every day adds to its establishment , and that falsehoods , however specious , however supported by power , or established by confederacies , are unable to stand before the stroke of time .
Against the inconveniencies and vexations of long life , may be set the pleasure of discovering truth , perhaps the only pleasure that age affords .
Nor is it a slight satisfaction to a man not utterly infatuated or depraved , to find opportunities of rectifying his notions , and regulating his conduct by new lights .


But much greater is the happiness of that man to whom every day brings a new proof of the reasonableness of his former determinations , and who finds , by the most unerring test , that his life has been spent in promotion of doctrines beneficial to mankind .
This , sir , is the happiness which I now enjoy , and for which those who never shall attain it , must look for an equivalent in lucrative employments , honorary titles , pompous equipages , and splendid palaces .


These , sir , are the advantages which are to be gained by a seasonable variation of principles , and by a ready compliance with the prevailing fashion of opinions  advantages which I , indeed , can not envy when they are purchased at so high a price , but of which age and observation has too frequently shown me the unbounded influence  and to which I can not deny that I have always ascribed the instability of conduct , and inconsistency of assertions , which I have discovered in many men , whose abilities I have no reason to depreciate , and of whom I can not but believe they would easily distinguish truth , were not falsehood recommended to them by the ornaments of wealth .


If there are in this new senate any men devoted to their private interest , any who prefer the gratification of their passions to the safety and happiness of their country , who can riot without remorse in the plunder of their constituents , who can forget the anguish of guilt in the noise of a feast , the pomp of a drawing-room , or the arms of a strumpet , and think expensive wickedness and the gaieties of folly equivalent to the fair fame of fidelity and the peace of virtue , to them I shall speak to no purpose  for I am far from imagining any power in my language to gain those to truth who have resigned their hearts to avarice or ambition , or to prevail upon men to change opinions , which they have indeed never believed , though they are hired to assert them .
There is a degree of wickedness which reproof or argument can not reclaim , as there is a degree of stupidity which instruction can not enlighten .


If my country , sir , has been so unfortunate as , once more , to commit her interest to those who propose to themselves no advantage from their trust , but that of selling it , I may perhaps fall , once more , under censure for declaring my opinion , and be , once more , treated as a criminal for asserting what they who punish me can not deny  for maintaining the inconsistency of Hanover maxims with the happiness of this nation , and for preserving the caution which was so strongly inculcated by the patriots that drew up the act of settlement , and gave the present imperial family their title to the throne .


These men , sir , whose wisdom can not be disputed , and whose zeal for his majesty 's family was equal to their knowledge , thought it requisite to provide some security against the prejudices of birth and education .
They were far from imagining , that they were calling to the throne a race of beings exalted above the frailties of humanity , or exempted by any peculiar privileges from errour or from ignorance .


They knew that every man was habitually , if not naturally , fond of his own nation , and that he was inclined to enrich it and defend it at the expense of another , even , perhaps , of that to which he is indebted , for much higher degrees of greatness , wealth and power  for every thing which makes one state of life preferable to another  and which , therefore , if reason could prevail over prejudice , and every action were regulated by strict justice , might claim more regard than that corner of the earth in which he only happened to be born .


They knew , sir , that confidence was not always returned , that we most willingly trust those whom we have longest known , and caress those with most fondness , whose inclinations we find by experience to correspond with our own , without regard to particular circumstances which may entitle others to greater regard , or higher degrees of credit , or of kindness .


Against these prejudices , which their sagacity enabled them to foresee , their integrity incited them to secure us , by provisions which every man then thought equitable and wise , because no man was then hired to espouse a contrary opinion .


To obviate the disposition which a foreign race of princes might have to trust their original subjects , it was enacted that none of them should be capable of any place of trust or profit in these kingdoms .
And to hinder our monarchs from transferring the revenues of Britain to Hanover , and enriching it with the commerce of our traders , and the labours of our husbandmen  from raising taxes to augment the splendour of a petty court , and increasing the garrisons of their mountains by misapplying that money which this nation should raise for its own defence , it was provided that the emperour of Britain should never return to his native dominions , but reside always in this kingdom , without any other care than that of gaining the affections of his British subjects , preserving their rights , and increasing their power .


It was imagined by that senate , that the electorate of Hanover , a subordinate dignity , held by custom of homage to a greater power , ought to be thought below the regard of the emperor of Britain , and that the sovereign of a nation like this ought to remember a lower state only to heighten his gratitude to the people by whom he was exalted .
They were far from imagining that Britain and Hanover would in time be considered as of equal importance , and that their sovereign would divide his years between one country and the other , and please himself with exhibiting in Hanover the annual show of the pomp and dignity of a British emperor .


This clause , sir , however , a later senate readily repealed  upon what motives I am not able to declare , having never heard the arguments which prevailed upon their predecessors to enact it , confuted or invalidated  nor have I found that the event has produced any justification of their conduct , or that the nation has received any remarkable advantage from the travels of our emperours .


There is another clause in that important act which yet the senate has not adventured to repeal , by which it is provided , that this nation shall not be engaged in war for the defence of the Hanoverian dominions  dominions of which we can have no interest in the protection or preservation  dominions , perhaps , of no great value , into whatever hands chance and negligence may throw them , which their situation has made entirely useless to a naval power  but which , though they can not benefit , may injure us , by diverting the attention of our sovereign , or withholding his affections .


Whether this clause , sir , has not sometimes been eluded , whether the six thousand Hessians , which we once supported , were of use to any of the British dominions , and whether a double number of the same nation , now paid with our money for the defence of the queen of Hungary , have not been stationed only where they might defend Hanover , without the least advantage to our confederates  whether the nation has not been condemned to double expenses in the support of this alliance , by raising , for the queen 's service , troops , which were only employed in the protection of Hanover , and then in succouring her with pecuniary supplies , it is , perhaps , at present unnecessary , though , I hope , not yet too late , to inquire .


It is at present unnecessary , because the clause which is proposed can not be denied to be equally proper , whether the act of settlement has been hitherto observed or violated  for the violation of it ought to engage us in some measures that may secure us for the future from the like injury  and the observation of it is a manifest proof how much it is approved by all parties , since , in so many deviations from this settlement , and an inconstancy of conduct of which an example is scarcely to be found , this law has been esteemed sacred , the bulwark of our rights , and the boundary which the sovereign power has not dared to overleap .


As his majesty , sir , has , in a very solemn manner , called upon us for our advice and assistance , what can be more proper than to lay before him our opinion on this important question ?
War is , next to slavery , one of the greatest calamities  and an unnecessary war , therefore , the greatest error of government , an error which can not be too cautiously obviated , or too speedily reformed .


If we consider , sir , the present state of the continent , there is nothing more probable than that the subjects of the elector of Hanover may solicit the assistance of the emperor of Britain , and , therefore , it is necessary to inform them , that their solicitations will be vain .
If we inquire into the suspicions of our fellow-subjects , we shall find them generally disturbed with fears that they shall be sacrificed to the security of foreign dominions , and , therefore , it is necessary to recall their affection to his majesty where it is impaired , and confirm their confidence where it has been hitherto preserved , by showing , in the most publick manner , how vainly they have been disquieted , and how grossly they have been mistaken .


It is certainly our duty , sir , to give such advice as may most truly inform his majesty of the sentiments of his people , and most effectually establish in the people an adherence to his majesty  as it is certain that no advice will be seconded by greater numbers than that which is proposed , nor can his majesty , by any act of goodness , so much endear his government , as by a ready promise to this nation of an exemption from any war in defence of Hanover .


I hope , sir , it will not be objected , that by such request a suspicion will be insinuated of designs detrimental to the British nation , and repugnant to the conditions on which his majesty ascended the throne , because an objection of equal force may rise against any advice whatever that shall be offered by the senate .


It may be always urged , sir , that to recommend any measures , is to suppose that they would not have been suggested to his majesty by his own wisdom , and , by consequence , that he is defective either in knowledge or in goodness , that he either mistakes or neglects the interest of his people .


Thus , sir , may the most laudable conduct be charged with sedition , and the most awful regard be accused of disrespect , by forced consequences , and exaggerated language  thus may senates become useless , lest they should appear to be wiser than their sovereign , and the sovereign be condemned to act only by the information of servile ministers , because no publick advice can safely be given him .


That kings must act upon the information of others , that they can see little with their own eyes through the mists which flattery is continually employed in raising before them , and that they are , therefore , most happy who have , by the constitution of the country which they govern , an opportunity of knowing the opinions of their people without disguise , has yet never been denied by any who do not separate the interest of the king from that of the people , and leave mankind no political distinction but that of tyrants and slaves .


This , sir , is the happiness of the emperour of Britain beyond other monarchs , an advantage by which he may be always enabled to contemplate the happy and flourishing state of his subjects , and to receive the blessings and acclamations of millions , that owe to his care their wealth and their security .


Of this advantage he can not be deprived , but by the cowardice or the treachery of those men who are delegated by the people , as the guardians of their liberties  and surely it requires no uncommon penetration to discover , that no act of treason can be equal in malignity to that perfidy which deprives the king of the affections of his subjects , by concealing from him their sentiments and petitions .
He that makes his monarch hated , must , undoubtedly , make him unhappy  and he that destroys his happiness , might more innocently take away his life .


To exempt myself , therefore , from such guilt , to discharge the trust conferred on me by my country , and to perform the duty which I owe to my king , I stand up to second this motion .


Mr. GYBBON spoke next , to the following purpose : -- Sir , as it is not easy to remember all the parts of an address by only once hearing it , and hearing it in a form different from that in which it is to be presented , I think it necessary to a more accurate consideration of it , that it should be read distinctly to the house .
We may otherwise waste our time in debates , to which only our own forgetfulness gives occasion  we may raise objections without reason , and propose amendments where there is no defect .
[ The address was accordingly read , and Mr. GYBBON proceeded . ]


Having now heard the address , I find by experience the propriety of my proposal  having remarked a clause , which , in my opinion , is necessary to be amended , and which I had not observed when it was repeated before .


It is well known , that the speeches from the throne , though pronounced by the king , are always considered as the compositions of the ministry , upon whom any false assertions would be charged , as the informers and counsellors of the crown .


It is well known , likewise , that whenever this house returns thanks to the king for any measures that have been pursued , those measures are supposed to be approved by them  and that approbation may be pleaded by the minister in his defence , whenever he shall be required to answer for the event of his counsels .


It is , therefore , in my opinion , extremely unreasonable to propose , that thanks should be returned to his majesty for his royal care in prosecuting the war against Spain  for what has been the consequence of that care , for which our thanks are to be , with so much solemnity , returned , but defeats , disgrace , and losses , the ruin of our merchants , the imprisonment of our sailors , idle shows of armaments , and useless expenses ?


What are the events which are to be recorded in an impartial account of this war  a war provoked by so long a train of insults and injuries , and carried on with so apparent an inequality of forces ?
Have we destroyed the fleets of our enemies , fired their towns , and laid their fortresses in ruins ?
Have we conquered their colonies , and plundered their cities , and reduced them to a necessity of receding from their unjust claims , and repaying the plunder of our merchants ?
Are their ambassadors now soliciting peace at the court of Britain , or applying to the neighbouring princes to moderate the resentment of their victorious enemies ?


I am afraid that the effects of our preparations , however formidable , are very different  they have only raised discontent among our countrymen , and contempt among our enemies .
We have shown that we are strong indeed , but that our force is made ineffectual by our cowardice  that when we threaten most loudly , we perform nothing  that we draw our swords but to brandish them , and only wait an opportunity to sheath them in such a manner , as not plainly to confess that we dare not strike .


If we consider , therefore , what effect our thanks for conduct like this must naturally produce , it will appear that they can only encourage our enemies , and dispirit our fellow-subjects .
It will be imagined that the Spaniards are a powerful nation , which it was the highest degree of temerity to attack  a nation by whom it is honour sufficient not to be overcome , and from whom we can not be defended without the most vigilant caution , and the most extensive knowledge both of politicks and war .


It will readily be perceived by the proud Spaniards , that it is only necessary to prosecute their views a little longer , to intimidate us with new demands , and amuse us with new preparations  and that we , who are always satisfied with our success , shall soon be weary of a war from which it is plain that we never expected any advantage , and therefore shall , in a short time , willingly receive such terms as our conquerors will grant us .


It is always to be remembered , how much all human affairs depend upon opinion , how often reputation supplies the want of real power , by making those afraid who can not be hurt , and by producing confidence where there is no superiority .
The opinion of which the senate ought to endeavour the promotion , is confidence in their steadiness , honesty , and wisdom .
Confidence which will not be much advanced by an address of thanks for the conduct of the war against Spain .


How justly may it be asked , when this address is spread over the world , what were the views with which the senate of Britain petitioned their sovereign to declare war against Spain ?


If their design was , as they then asserted , to procure security for the commerce of America , and reparation for the injuries which their merchants had received , by what fluctuation of counsels , by what prevalence of new opinions , have they now abandoned it ?
For that they have no longer the same intentions , that they now no more either propose security , or demand recompense , is evident  since though they have obtained neither , yet are they thankful for the conduct of the war .


To what can this apparent instability be imputed , but to the want either of wisdom to balance their own power with that of their enemies , and discern the true interest of their country , or to a mean compliance with the clamours of the people , to whom they durst not refuse the appearance of a war , though they had no expectation of honour or success ?


But in far other terms , sir , will the Spaniards speak of the address which is now proposed .
`` Behold , say our boasting enemies , the spirit and wisdom of that assembly , whose counsels hold the continent in suspense , and whose determinations change the fate of kingdoms  whose vote transfers sovereignty , covers the ocean with fleets , prescribes the operation of distant wars , and fixes the balance of the world .
Behold them amused with idle preparations , levying money for mockeries of war , and returning thanks for the pleasure of the show .
Behold them looking with wonderful tranquillity on the loss of a great number of their ships , which have been seized upon their own coasts by our privateers , and congratulating themselves and their monarch that any have been preserved .
How great would have been the exultation , and how loud the applauses , had they succeeded in any of their designs  had they obstructed the departure of our fleets , or hindered our descent upon the dominions of the queen of Hungary  had they confined our privateers in our harbours , defeated any of our troops , or overrun any of our colonies !
In what terms would they have expressed their gratitude for victory , who are thus thankful for disappointments and disgrace ? ''


Such , sir , must be the remarks of our enemies upon an address like that which is now proposed  remarks which we and our allies must be condemned to hear , without attempting a reply .
For what can be urged to extenuate the ridicule of returning thanks where we ought either to express resentment , offer consolations , and propose the means of better success , or cover our grief and shame with perpetual silence ?


When it shall be told in foreign nations , that the senate of Britain had returned thanks for the escape of the Spaniards from Ferrol , their uninterrupted expedition to Italy , the embarrassment of their own trade , the captivity of their sailors , and the destruction of their troops , what can they conclude , but that the senate of Britain is a collection of madmen , whom madmen have deputed to transact the publick affairs ?
And what must be the influence of such a people , and such a senate , will be easily conceived .


If I have given way , sir , in these observations , to any wanton hyperbole , or exaggerated assertions , they will , I hope , be pardoned by those who shall reflect upon the real absurdity of the proposal , which I am endeavouring to show in its true state , and by all who shall consider , that to return thanks for the management of the war , is to return thanks for the carnage of Carthagena , for the ruin of our merchants , for the loss of our reputation , and for the exaltation of the family of Bourbon .


I hope no man will be so unjust , or can be so ignorant , as to insinuate or believe , that I impute any part of our miscarriages to the personal conduct of his majesty , or that I think his majesty 's concern for the prosperity of his people unworthy of the warmest and sincerest gratitude .
If the address were confined to the inspection of our sovereign alone , I should be very far from censuring or ridiculing it  for his majesty has not the event of war in his power , nor can confer upon his ministers or generals that knowledge which they have neglected to acquire , or that capacity which nature has denied them .
He may perform more than we have a right to expect , and yet be unsuccessful  he may deserve the utmost gratitude , even when , by the misconduct of his servants , the nation is distressed .


But , sir , in drawing up an address , we should remember that we are declaring our sentiments not only to his majesty , but to all Europe  to our allies , our enemies , and our posterity  that this address will be understood , like all others  that thanks offered in this manner , by custom , signify approbation  and that , therefore , we must at present repress our gratitude , because it can only bring into contempt our sovereign and ourselves .


Sir Robert WALPOLE spoke next , to this effect : -- Sir , I am very far from thinking that the war against Spain has been so unsuccessful as some gentlemen have represented it  that the losses which we have suffered have been more frequent than we had reason to expect from the situation of our enemies , and the course of our trade  or our defeats , such as the common chance of war does not often produce , even when the inequality of the contending powers is incontestable , and the ultimate event as near to certainty , as the nature of human affairs ever can admit .


Nor am I convinced , sir , even though it should be allowed that no exaggeration had been made of our miscarriages , that the impropriety of an address of thanks to his majesty for his regal care in the management of the war , is gross or flagrant .
For if it be allowed that his majesty may be innocent of all the misconduct that has produced our defeats , that he may have formed schemes wisely , which were unskilfully prosecuted  that even valour and knowledge concurring , will not always obtain success  and that , therefore , some losses may be suffered , and some defeats received , though not only his majesty gave the wisest direction , but his officers executed them with the utmost diligence and fidelity  how will it appear from our ill success , that our sovereign does not deserve our gratitude ?
And if it shall appear to us that our thanks are merited , who shall restrain us from offering them in the most publick and solemn manner ?


For my part , I think no consideration worthy of regard in competition with truth and justice , and , therefore , shall never forbear any expression of duty to my sovereign , for fear of the ridicule of our secret , or the reproaches of our publick enemies .


With regard to the address under our consideration , if it be allowed either that we have not been unsuccessful in any opprobrious degree , or that ill success does not necessarily imply any defect in the conduct of his majesty , or debar us from the right of acknowledging his goodness and his wisdom , I think , sir , no objection can be made to the form of expression now proposed , in which all sounding and pompous language , all declamatory exaggeration , and studied figures of speech , all appearance of exultation , and all the farce of rhetorick are carefully avoided , and nothing inserted that may disgust the most delicate , or raise scruples in the most sincere .


Yet , sir , that we may not waste our time upon trivial disputes , when the nation expects relief from our counsels , that we may not suspend the prosecution of the war by complaints of past defeats , or retard that assistance and advice which our sovereign demands , by inquiring whether it may be more proper to thank , or to counsel him , I am willing , for the sake of unanimity , that this clause should be omitted  and hope that no other part of the address can give any opportunity for criticism , or for objections .


Sir , it is no wonder that the right honourable gentleman willingly consents to the omission of this clause , which could be inserted for no other purpose than that he might sacrifice it to the resentment which it must naturally produce , and by an appearance of modesty and compliance , pass easily through the first day and obviate any severe inquiries that might be designed .


He is too well acquainted with the opinion of many whom the nation has chosen to represent them , and with the universal clamours of the people , too accurately informed of the state of our enemies , and too conscious how much his secret machinations have hindered our success , to expect or hope that we should meet here to return thanks for the management of the war  of a war in which nothing has been attempted by his direction that was likely to succeed , and in which no advantage has been gained , but by acting without orders , and against his hopes .


That I do not charge him , sir , without reason , or invent accusations only to obstruct his measures , or to gratify my own resentment  that I do not eagerly catch flying calumnies , prolong the date of casual reproaches , encourage the malignity of the envious , or adopt the suspicions of the melancholy  that I do not impose upon myself by a warm imagination , and endeavour to communicate to others impressions which I have only received myself from prejudice and malignity , will be proved from the review of his conduct since the beginning of our dispute with Spain , in which it will be found that he has been guilty , not of single errours , but of deliberate treachery  that he has always cooperated with our enemies , and sacrificed to his private interest the happiness and the honour of the British nation .


How long our merchants were plundered , our sailors enslaved , and our colonies intimidated without resentment  how long the Spaniards usurped the dominion of the seas , searched our ships at pleasure , confiscated the cargoes without control , and tortured our fellow-subjects with impunity , can not but be remembered .
Not only every gentleman in this house , but every man in the nation , however indolent , ignorant , or obscure , can tell what barbarities were exercised , what ravages were committed , what complaints were made , and how they were received .
It is universally known that this gentleman , and those whom he has seduced by pensions and employments , treated the lamentations of ruined families , and the outcries of tortured Britons , as the clamours of sedition , and the murmurs of malignity suborned to inflame the people , and embarrass the government .


It is known , sir , that our losses were at one time ridiculed as below the consideration of the legislature , and the distress of the most useful and honest part of mankind was made the subject of merriment and laughter  the awkward wit of all the hirelings of the town was exerted to divert the attention of the publick , and all their art was employed to introduce other subjects into conversation , or to still the complaints which they heard with a timely jest .


But their wit was not more successful on this , than on other occasions  their imaginations were soon exhausted , and they found , as at other times , that they must have recourse to new expedients .
The first artifice of shallow courtiers is to elude with promises those complaints which they can not confute , a practice that requires no understanding or knowledge , and therefore has been generally followed by the administration .
This artifice they quickly made use of , when they found that neither the merchants nor the nation were to be silenced by an affectation of negligence , or the sallies of mirth  that it was no longer safe to jest upon the miseries of their countrymen , the destruction of our trade , and the violation of our rights , they condescended , therefore , to some appearances of compassion , and promised to exert all their influence to procure redress and security .


That they might not appear , sir , to have made this promise only to free themselves from present importunity , they set negotiations on foot , despatched memorials , remonstrances , propositions , and computations , and with an air of gravity and importance , assembled at proper times to peruse the intelligence which they received , and to concert new instructions for their ministers .


While this farce was acted , sir , innumerable artifices were made use of to reconcile the nation to suspense and delay .
Sometimes the distance of the Spanish dominions in America retarded the decision of our claims .
Sometimes the dilatory disposition of the Spaniards , and the established methods of their courts , made it impossible to procure a more speedy determination .
Sometimes orders were despatched to America in favour of our trade , and sometimes those orders were neglected by the captains of the Spanish ships , and the governours of their provinces  and when it was inquired why those captains and governours were not punished or recalled , we were treated with contempt , for not knowing what had been so lately told us of the dilatory proceedings of the Spanish courts .


In the mean time our merchants were plundered , and our sailors thrown into dungeons  our flag was insulted , and our navigation restrained , by men acting under the commission of the king of Spain  we perceived no effect of our negotiations but the expense , and our enemies not only insisted on their former claims , but prosecuted them with the utmost rigour , insolence , and cruelty .


It must , indeed , sir , be urged in favour of our minister , that he did not refuse any act of submission , or omit any method of supplication by which he might hope to soften the Spaniards  he solicited their favour at their own court , he sent commissaries into their country , he assisted them in taking possession of dominions , to which neither we nor they have proved a right  and he employed the navies of Britain to transport into Italy the prince on whom the new-erected kingdom was to be conferred .


Well might he expect that the Spaniards would be softened by so much kindness and forbearance , and that gratitude would at length induce them to spare those whom no injuries or contempt had been able to alienate from them , and to allow those a free course through the seas of America , to whom they had been indebted for an uninterrupted passage to the possession of a kingdom .


He might likewise urge , sir , that when he was obliged to make war upon them , he was so tender of their interest , that the British admiral was sent out with orders rather to destroy his own fleet than the galleons , which , in appearance , he was sent to take , and to perish by the inclemency of the climate , rather than enter the Spanish ports , terrify their colonies , or plunder their towns .


But to little purpose , sir , did our minister implore the compassion of the Spaniards , and represent the benefits by which we might claim it  for his compliance was by the subtle Spaniards attributed , not to kindness , but to fear  and it was therefore determined to reduce him to absolute slavery , by the same practices which had already sunk him to so abject a state .


They therefore treated our remonstrances with contempt , continued their insolence and their oppressions , and while our agent was cringing at their court with fresh instructions in his hand , while he was hurrying with busy looks from one grandee to another , and , perhaps , dismissed without an audience one day , and sent back in the midst of his harangue on another , the guardships of the Spaniards continued their havock , our merchants were ruined , and our sailors tortured .


At length , sir , the nation was too much inflamed to be any longer amused with idle negotiations , or trifling expedients  the streets echoed with the clamours of the populace , and this house was crowded with petitions from the merchants .
The honourable person , with all his art , found himself unable any longer to elude a determination of this affair .
Those whom he had hitherto persuaded that he had failed merely for want of abilities , began now to suspect that he had no desire of better success  and those who had hitherto cheerfully merited their pensions by an unshaken adherence to all his measures , who had extolled his wisdom and his integrity with all the confidence of security , began now to be shaken by the universality of the censures which the open support of perfidy brought upon them .
They were afraid any longer to assert what they neither believed themselves , nor could persuade others to admit .
The most indolent were alarmed , the most obstinate convinced , and the most profligate ashamed .


What could now be done , sir , to gain a few months , to secure a short interval of quiet , in which his agents might be employed to disseminate some new falsehood , bribe to his party some new vindicators , or lull the people with the opiate of another expedient , with an account of concessions from the court of Spain , or a congress to compute the losses , and adjust the claims of our merchants ?


Something was necessarily to be attempted , and orders were therefore despatched by our minister , to his slave at the court of Spain , to procure some stipulations that might have at least the appearance of a step towards the conclusion of the debate .
His agent obeyed him with his usual alacrity and address , and in time sent him , for the satisfaction of the British people , the celebrated convention .


The convention , sir , has been so lately discussed , is so particularly remembered , and so universally condemned , that it would be an unjustifiable prodigality of time to expatiate upon it .
There were but few in the last senate , and I hope there are none in this , who did not see the meanness of suffering incontestable claims to be disputed by commissaries , the injustice of the demand which was made upon the South-sea company , and the contemptuous insolence of amusing us with the shadow of a stipulation , which was to vanish into nothing , unless we purchased a ratification of it , by paying what we did not owe .


The convention , therefore , sir , was so far from pacifying , that it only exasperated the nation , and took from our minister the power of acting any longer openly in favour of the Spaniards  of whom it must be confessed , that their wisdom was overpowered by their pride , and that , for the sake of showing to all the powers of Europe the dependence in which they held the court of Britain , they took from their friends the power of serving them any longer , and made it unsafe for them to pay that submission to which they were inclined .


The Spaniards did not sufficiently distinguish between the nation and the ministry of Britain , nor suspected that their interests , inclinations , and opinions were directly opposite  and that those who were caressed , feared , and reverenced by the ministry , were by the people hated , despised , and ridiculed .


By enslaving our ministry , they weakly imagined that they had conquered our nation  nor , perhaps , sir , would they quickly have discovered their mistake , had they used their victory with greater moderation , condescended to govern their new province with less rigour , and sent us laws in any other form than that of the convention .


But the security which success excites , produced in them the same effects as it has often done in others , and destroyed , in some degree , the advantages of the conquest by which it was inspired .
The last proof of their contempt of our sovereign and our nation , was too flagrant to be palliated , and too publick not to be resented .
The cries of the nation were redoubled , the solicitations of the merchants renewed , the absurdity of our past conduct exposed , the meanness of our forbearance reproached , and the necessity of more vigorous measures evidently proved .


The friends of Spain discovered , sir , at length , that war was necessarily to be proclaimed , and that it would be no longer their interest to act in open opposition to justice and reason , to the policy of all ages , and remonstrances of the whole nation .


The minister , therefore , after long delays , after having run round the circle of all his artifices , and endeavouring to intimidate the nation by false representations of the power of our enemies , and the danger of an invasion from them , at length suffered war to be proclaimed , though not till he had taken all precautions that might disappoint us of success .


He knew that the state of the Spanish dominions exposed them in a particular manner to sudden incursions by small parties , and that in former wars against them , our chief advantage had been gained by the boldness and subtilty of private adventurers , who by hovering over their coasts in small vessels , without raising the alarms which the sight of a royal navy necessarily produces , had discovered opportunities of landing unexpectedly , and entering their towns by surprise , of plundering their wealthy ships , or enriching themselves by ransoms and compositions  he knew what inconsiderable bodies of men , incited by private advantage , selected with care for particular expeditions , instructed by secret intelligence , and concealed by the smallness of their numbers , had found means to march up into the country , through ways which would never have been attempted by regular forces , and have brought upon the Spaniards more terrour and distress than could have been produced by a powerful army , however carefully disciplined or however skilfuly commanded .


It was , therefore , sir , his first care to secure his darling Spaniards from the pernicious designs of private adventurers  he knew not but some of Elizabeth 's heroes might unfortunately revive , and terrify , with an unexpected invasion , the remotest corners of the Spanish colonies , or appear before their ports with his nimble sloops , and bid defiance to their navies and their garrisons .
When , therefore , a bill was introduced into this house , by which encouragement was given to the subjects of this kingdom to fit out privateers , and by which those who should conquer any of the colonies of the Spaniards , were confirmed in the possession of them for ever , it can not be forgotten with what zeal he opposed , and with what steadiness he rejected it , though it is not possible to assign any disadvantage which could have been produced by passing it , and the utmost that could be urged against it was , that it was unnecessary and useless .


Having thus discouraged that method of war which was most to be dreaded by our enemies , and left them little to fear but from national forces and publick preparations , his next care was to secure them from any destructive blow , by giving them time to equip their fleets , collect their forces , repair their fortifications , garrison their towns , and regulate their trade  for this purpose he delayed , as long as it was possible , the despatch of our navies , embarrassed our levies of sailors by the violence of impresses  violence , which proper encouragement and regulations might have made unnecessary  and suffered the privateers of the enemy to plunder our merchants without control , under pretence that ships of war could not be stationed , nor convoys provided for their protection .


At length several fleets were fitted out , Vernon was sent to America , and Haddock into the Mediterranean , with what coqsequences it is well known  nor should I mention them at this time , had I not been awakened to the remembrance of them by a proposal of thanks for the conduct of the war .


The behaviour of the two admirals was very different  though it has not yet appeared but that their orders were the same .
Vernon with six ships destroyed those fortifications , before which Hosier formerly perished , in obedience to the commands of our ministry .
How this success was received by the minister and his adherents , how much they were offended at the exultations of the populace , how evidently they appeared to consider it as a breach of their scheme , and a deviation from their directions , the whole nation can relate .


Nor is it to be forgotten , sir , how invidiously the minister himself endeavoured to extenuate the honour of that action , by attempting to procure in the address , which was on that occasion presented to his majesty , a suppression of the number of the ships with which he performed it .


In the mean time , sir , the nation expected accounts of the same kind from the Mediterranean , where Haddock was stationed with a very considerable force  but instead of relations of ports bombarded , and towns plundered , of navies destroyed , and villages laid in ashes , we were daily informed of the losses of our merchants , whose ships were taken almost within sight of our squadrons .


We had , indeed , once the satisfaction of hearing that the fleet of Spain was confined in the port of Cadiz , unprovided with provisions , and it was rashly reported that means would either be found of destroying them in the harbour , or that they would be shut up in that unfruitful part of the country , till they should be obliged to disband their crews .


We , therefore , sir , bore with patience the daily havock of our trade , in expectation of the entire destruction of the royal navy of Spain , which would reduce them to despair of resistance , and compel them to implore peace .
But while we were flattering ourselves with those pleasing dreams , we were wakened on a sudden with an astonishing account that the Spaniards had left Cadiz , and , without any interruption from the Britons , were taking in provisions at Ferrol .


This disappointment of our expectations did , indeed , discourage us , but not deprive us of hope  we knew that the most politick are sometimes deceived , and that the most vigilant may sometimes relax their attention  we did not expect in our commanders any exemption from human errours , and required only that they should endeavour to repair their failures , and correct their mistakes  and , therefore , waited without clamour , in expectation that what was omitted at Cadiz would be performed at Ferrol .


But no sooner , sir , had the Spaniards stored their fleet , than we were surprised with a revolution of affairs yet more wonderful .
Haddock , instead of remaining before Ferrol , was drawn off by some chimerical alarm to protect Minorca , and the Spaniards in the mean time sailed away to America , in conjunction with the French squadron that had been for some time ready for the voyage .


If we consider the absurdity of this conduct , it can not but be imagined that our minister must send Haddock false intelligence and treacherous directions , on purpose that the Spanish fleet might escape without interruption .
For how can it be conceived that the Spaniards could have formed any real design of besieging port Mahon ?
Was it probable that they would have sent an army , in defenceless transports , into the jaws of the British fleet ?
and it was well known that they had no ships of war to protect them .
It was not very agreeable to common policy to land an army upon an island , an island wholly destitute of provisions for their support , while an hostile navy was in possession of the sea , by which the fortress which their troops were destined to besiege might be daily supplied with necessaries , and the garrison augmented with new forces , while their army would be itself besieged in a barren island , without provisions , without recruits , without hope of succour , or possibility of success .


But such was the solicitude of our admiral for the preservation of Minorca , that he abandoned his station , and suffered the Spaniards to join their confederates of France , and prosecute their voyage to America without hinderance or pursuit .


In America they remained for some time masters of the sea , and confined Vernon to the ports  but want of provisions obliging the French to return , no invasion of our colonies was attempted , nor any of those destructive measures pursued which we had reason to fear , and of which our minister , notwithstanding his wonderful sagacity , could not have foretold that they would have been defeated by an unexpected scarcity of victuals .


The Spaniards , however , gained , by this expedient , time to repair their fortifications , strengthen their garrisons , and dispose their forces in the most advantageous manner  and therefore , though they were not enabled to attack our dominions , had at least an opportunity of securing their own .


At length , sir , lest it should be indisputably evident that our minister was in confederacy with the Spaniards , it was determined , that their American territories should be invaded  but care was taken to disappoint the success of the expedition by employing new-raised troops , and officers without experience , and to make it burdensome to the nation by a double number of officers , of which no use could be discovered , but that of increasing the influence , and multiplying the dependants of the ministry .


It was not thought sufficient , sir , to favour the designs of the Spaniards by the delay which the levy of new troops necessarily produced , and to encourage them by the probability of an easy resistance against raw forces  nor was the nation , in the opinion of the minister , punished for its rebellion against him with adequate severity , by being condemned to support a double number of troops .
Some other methods were to be used for embarrassing our preparations and protracting the war .


The troops , therefore , sir , being , by the accident of a hard winter , more speedily raised than it was reasonable to expect , were detained in this island for several months , upon trivial pretences  and were at length suffered to embark at a time when it was well known that they would have much more formidable enemies than the Spaniards to encounter  when the unhealthy season of the American climate must necessarily destroy them by thousands  when the air itself was poison , and to be wounded certainly death .


These were the hardships to which part of our fellow-subjects have been exposed by the tyranny of the minister  hardships which caution could not obviate , nor bravery surmount  they were sent to combat with nature , to encounter with the blasts of disease , and to make war against the elements .
They were sent to feed the vultures of America , and to gratify the Spaniards with an easy conquest .


In the passage the general died , and the command devolved upon a man who had never seen an enemy , and was , therefore , only a speculative warriour  an accident , which , as it was not unlikely to happen , would have been provided against by any minister who wished for success .
The melancholy event of this expedition I need not mention , it was such as might be reasonably expected  when our troops were sent out without discipline , without commanders , into a country where even the dews are fatal , against enemies informed of their approach , secured by fortifications , inured to the climate , well provided , and skilfully commanded .


In the mean time , sir , it is not to be forgotten what depredations were made upon our trading vessels , with what insolence ships of very little force approached our coasts , and seized our merchants in sight of our fortifications  it is not to be forgotten that the conduct of some of those who owed their revenues and power to the minister , gave yet stronger proofs of a combination .


It is not to be forgotten with what effrontery the losses of our merchants were ridiculed , with what contemptuous triumph of revenge they were charged with the guilt of this fatal war , and how publickly they were condemned to suffer for their folly .


For this reason , sir , they were either denied the security of convoys , or forsaken in the most dangerous parts of the sea , by those to whose protection they were , in appearance , committed .
For this reason , they were either hindered from engaging in their voyage by the loss of those men who were detained unactive in the ships of war , or deprived of their crews upon the high seas , or suffered to proceed only to become a prey to the Spaniards .


But it was not , sir , a sufficient gratification of our implacable minister , that the merchants were distressed for alarming the nation  it was thought , likewise , necessary to punish the people for believing too easily the reports of the merchants , and to warn them for ever against daring to imagine themselves able to discern their own interest , or to prescribe other measures to the ministers , than they should be themselves inclined to pursue  our minister was resolved to show them , by a master-stroke , that it was in his power to disappoint their desires , by seeming to comply , and to destroy their commerce and their happiness , by the very means by which they hoped to secure them .


For this purpose , sir , did this great man summon all his politicks together , and call to council all his confidants and all his dependants  and it was , at length , after mature deliberation , determined , by their united wisdom , to put more ships into commission , to aggravate the terrours of the impress by new violence and severity , to draw the sailors by the promise of large rewards from the service of the merchants , to collect a mighty fleet , and to despatch it on a secret expedition .


A secret expedition , sir , is a new term of ministerial art , a term which may have been , perhaps , formerly made use of by soldiers , for a design to be executed without giving the enemy an opportunity of providing for their defence  but is now used for a design with which the enemy is better acquainted than those to whom the execution of it is committed .
A secret expedition is now an expedition of which every one knows the design , but those at whose expense it is undertaken .
It is a kind of naval review , which excels those of the park in magnificence and expense , but is equally useless , and equally ridiculous .


Upon these secret expeditions , however , were fixed for a long time the expectations of the people  they saw all the appearances of preparation for real war  they were informed , that the workmen in the docks were retained by uncommon wages to do double duty  they saw the most specious encouragement offered to the sailors  they saw naval stores accumulated with the utmost industry , heard of nothing but the proof of new cannon , and new contracts for provision  and how much reason soever they had to question the sincerity of the great man who had so long engrossed the management of all affairs , they did not imagine that he was yet so abandoned to levy forces only to exhaust their money , and equip fleets only to expose them to ridicule .


When , therefore , sir , after the usual delays , the papers had informed the people that the great fleet was sailed , they no longer doubted that the Spaniards were to be reduced to our own terms  they expected to be told , in a few days , of the destruction of fleets , the demolition of castles , and the plunder of cities  and everyone envied the fortune of those who , by being admitted into their formidable fleet , were entitled to the treasures of such wealthy enemies .


When they had for some time indulged these expectations , an account was brought , that the fleet was returned without the least action , or the least attempt , and that new provisions were to be taken in , that they might set out upon another secret expedition .


But , sir , this wonder-working term had now lost its efficacy , and it was discovered , that secret expeditions , like all other secret services , were only expedients to drain the money of the people , and to conceal the ignorance or villany of the minister .


Such has been the conduct for which we are desired to return thanks in an humble and dutiful address , such are the transactions which we are to recommend to the approbation of our constituents , and such the triumphs upon which we must congratulate our sovereign .


For my part , sir , I can not but think that silence is a censure too gentle of that wickedness which no language can exaggerate , and for which , as it has , perhaps , no example , human kind have not yet provided a name .
Murder , parricide , and treason , are modest appellations when referred to that conduct by which a king is betrayed , and a nation ruined , under pretence of promoting its interest , by a man trusted with the administration of publick affairs .


Let us , therefore , sir , if it be thought not proper to lay before his majesty the sentiments of his people in their full extent , at least not endeavour to conceal them from him  let us , at least , address him in such a manner as may give him some occasion to inquire into the late transactions , which have for many years been such , that to inquire into them is to condemn them .


Sir Robert WALPOLE rose again , and spoke to this effect : -- Sir , though I am far from being either confounded or intimidated by this atrocious charge  though I am confident , that all the measures which have been so clamorously censured , will admit of a very easy vindication , and that whenever they are explained they will be approved  yet as an accusation so complicated can not be confuted without a long recapitulation of past events , and a deduction of many particular circumstances , some of which may require evidence , and some a very minute and prolix explication , I can not think this a proper day for engaging in the controversy , because it is my interest that it may be accurately discussed .


At present , sir , I shall content myself with bare assertions , like those of him by whom I am accused , and hope they will not be heard with less attention , or received with less belief .
For surely it was never denied to any man to defend himself with the same weapons with which he is attacked .


I shall , therefore , sir , make no scruple to assert , that the treasure of the publick has been employed with the utmost frugality , to promote the purposes for which it was granted  that our foreign affairs have been transacted with the utmost fidelity , in pursuance of long consultations  and shall venture to add , that our success has not been such as ought to produce any suspicion of negligence or treachery .


That our design against Carthagena was defeated , can not be denied  but what war has been one continued series of success ?
In the late war with France , of which the conduct has been so lavishly celebrated , did no designs miscarry ?
If we conquered at Ramillies , were we not in our turn beaten at Almanza ?
If we destroyed the French ships , was it not always with some loss of our own ?
And since the sufferings of our merchants have been mentioned with so much acrimony , do not the lists of the ships taken in that war , prove that the depredations of privateers can not be entirely prevented ?


The disappointment , sir , of the publick expectation by the return of the fleets , has been charged upon the administration , as a crime too enormous to be mentioned without horrour and detestation .
That the ministry have not the elements in their power , that they do not prescribe the course of the wind , is a sufficient proof of their negligence and weakness : with as much justice is it charged upon them , that the expectations of the populace , which they did not raise , and to which , perhaps , the conquest of a kingdom had not been equal , failed of being gratified .


I am very far from hoping or desiring that the house should be satisfied with a defence like this  I know , by observing the practice of the opponents of the ministry , what fallacy may be concealed in general assertions , and am so far from wishing to evade a more exact inquiry , that if the gentleman who has thus publickly and confidently accused the ministry , will name a day for examining the state of the nation , I will second his motion .


[ The address was at length agreed to , without a division . ]


Mr. PULTENEY then moved , that the state of the nation should be considered six weeks hence  sir Robert WALPOLE seconded the motion , and it was unanimously agreed , that this house will , on the 21st of next month , resolve itself into a committee of the whole house , to consider of the state of the nation .
But when that day came , sir Robert WALPOLE having been able to defeat a motion which was to refer some papers to a secret committee , the consideration of the state of the nation was put off for a fortnight  but on the eve of that day , both houses adjourned for fourteen days , during which , sir Robert WALPOLE resigned his employments of first lord of the treasury , and chancellor and under treasurer of his majesty 's exchequer  and was created a peer , by the title of lord WALPOLE , and earl of ORFORD .


HOUSE OF COMMONS , MARCH 9 , 1741-2 .


ON A MOTION FOR INQUIRING INTO THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS AT HOME AND ABROAD , DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS .


Lord LIMERICK rose , and spoke in the following manner : -- Sir , as I am about to offer to the house a motion of the highest importance to the honour and happiness of our country , to the preservation of our privileges , and the continuance of our constitution , I make no doubt of a candid attention from this assembly , and hope for such a determination as shall be the result not of external influence , but of real conviction .


I can not but congratulate myself and all lovers of their country , that we are arrived at a time , in which such hopes may be rationally indulged , that we shall soon see the triumph of liberty , and the renovation of senatorial freedom .
It is not without the highest satisfaction , that I find my life protracted to that happy day , in which the yoke of dependence has been shaken off , and the shackles of oppression have been broken  in which truth and justice have once more raised up their heads , and obtained that regard which had so long been paid to splendid wickedness and successful rapine .


The time is now past , in which it was meritorious to harden the heart against pity , and the forehead against shame  to plunder the people by needless taxes , and insult them by displaying their spoils before their eyes , in luxurious riot , and boundless magnificence  when the certain method of obtaining what the greatest part , even of good men , can not but sometimes wish to acquire , interest , affluence , and honour , was an implicit resignation to authority , a desertion of all principles , defiance of all censure , and an open declaration against any other motives of action , than the sole pleasure of an arbitrary minister .


It is now , sir , no longer considered as an instance of disaffection to the government , to represent the miseries and declare the opinions of the people  to propose their interest as the great basis of government , the general end of society , and the parent of law .
It is now no longer criminal to affirm , that they have a right to complain when they are , in their own opinion , injured , and to be heard when they complain .
It may now be with safety asserted , that those who swell with the pride of office , and glitter with the magnificence of a court , however they may display their affluence , or boast their titles  with whatever contempt they may have learned of late to look upon their fellow-subjects , who have no possessions but what they have obtained by their industry , nor any honours but what are voluntarily paid to their understanding and their virtue  with whatever authority they may dictate to their dependants , or whatever reverence they may exact from a long subordination of hirelings , are , amidst all their pomp and influence , only the servants of the people , intrusted by them with the administration of their affairs , and accountable to them for the abuse of trust .


That trusts of the highest importance have been long abused , that the servants of the people , having long thought themselves out of the reach of justice , and above examination , have very ill discharged the offices in which they have been engaged , that the publick advantage has been wholly disregarded , that treaties have been concluded without any regard to the interest of Britain , and that our foreign and domestick affairs have been managed with equal ignorance , negligence , or wickedness , the present state of Europe , and the calamities of this country , will sufficiently inform us .


If we survey the condition of foreign nations , we shall find , that the power and dominions of the family of Bourbon , a family which has never had any other designs than the extirpation of true religion , and the universal slavery of mankind , have been daily increased .
We shall find that they have increased by the declension of the house of Austria , which treaties and our interest engage us to support .


But had their acquisitions been made only by the force of arms , had they grown stronger only by victories , and more wealthy only by plunder , our ministers might , with some appearance of reason , have imputed their success to accident , and informed us , that we gained , in the mean time , a sufficient counterbalance to those advantages , by an uninterrupted commerce , and by the felicity of peace  peace , which , in every nation , has been found to produce affluence , and of which the wisest men have thought that it could scarcely be too dearly purchased .


But peace has , in this nation , by the wonderful artifices of our ministers , been the parent of poverty and misery  we have been so far from finding our commerce extended by it , that we have enjoyed it only by a contemptible patience of the most open depredations , by a long connivance at piracy , and by a continued submission to insults , which no other nation would have borne .


We have been so far from seeing any part of our taxes remitted , that we have been loaded with more rigorous exactions to support the expenses of peace , than were found necessary to defray the charges of a war against those , whose opulence and power had incited them to aspire to the dominion of the world .


How these taxes have been employed , and why our trade has been neglected , why our allies have been betrayed , and why the ancient enemies of our country have been suffered to grow powerful by our connivances , it is now time to examine  and therefore I move , that a committee be appointed to inquire into the conduct of affairs at home and abroad during the last twenty years .


Sir John ST. AUBIN then spoke as follows : -- Sir , I rise up to second this motion  and , as the noble lord has opened it in so full and proper a manner , and as I do not doubt but that other gentlemen are ready to support it , more practised in speaking , of greater abilities and authority than myself , I am the less anxious about the injury it may receive from the part I bear in it .
I think the proposition is so evident , that it wants no enforcement  it comes to you from the voice of the nation , which , thank God , has at last found admittance within these walls .


Innocence is of so delicate a nature , that it can not bear suspicion , and therefore will desire inquiry  because it will always be justified by it .
Guilt , from its own consciousness , will use subterfuges , and fly to concealment  and the more righteous and authoritative the inquiry , the more it will be avoided  because the greater will be the dread of punishment .


In private life , I am contented with men 's virtues only , without seeking for opportunities of blame .
In a publick character , when national grievances cry aloud for inquiry and justice , it is our duty to pursue all the footsteps of guilt  and the loud , the pathetick appeal of my constituents , is more forcibly persuasive than any motive of private tenderness .
This appeal is not the clamour of faction , artfully raised to disturb the operation of government , violent for a while , and soon to be appeased .
It is the complaint of long and patient sufferings , a complaint not to be silenced  and which all endeavours to suppress it , would only make more importunate and clamorous .
It is the solemn appeal of the whole people , of the united body of our constituents , in this time of national calamity , earnestly beseeching you , in a legal parliamentary way , to redress their grievances , to revive your ancient right of inquiry , to explore the most remote and hidden sources of iniquity , to detect the bold authors of their distress , that they may be made examples of national justice .


It is to you they appeal , the true , the genuine representatives of the people .
Not like former parliaments , an instrument of state , the property of a minister , purchased by the missionaries of corruption , who have been dispersed through the kingdom , and furnished with the publick money to invade all natural interest , by poisoning the morals of the people .
Upon this rotten foundation has been erected a towering fabrick of corruption : a most dangerous conspiracy has been carried on against the very essence of our constitution , a formidable system of ministerial power has been formed , fallaciously assuming , under constitutional appearances , the name of legal government .


In this system we have seen the several offices of administration meanly resolving themselves under the direction and control of one man : while this scheme was pursued , the nation has been ingloriously patient of foreign indignities  our trade has been most shamefully neglected , or basely betrayed  a war with an impotent enemy , most amply provided for , unsuccessfully carried on  the faith of treaties broke  our natural allies deserted , and weakened even by that power , which we now dread for want of their assistance .


It is not the bare removal from office that will satisfy the nation , especially if such removal is dignified with the highest marks of royal favour .
This only gives mankind a reasonable fear that his majesty has rather condescended to the importunities , than adopted the opinion of his people .
It is , indeed , a most gracious condescension , a very high instance of his majesty 's just intentions to remove any of his servants upon national suspicion  but it will give his majesty a most unfavourable opinion of his people , if he is not satisfied that this suspicion was just .
It is the unfortunate situation of arbitrary kings , that they know the sentiments of their people only from whisperers in their closet .
Our monarchy has securer establishments .
Our sovereign is always sure of knowing the true sense of his people , because he may see it through the proper , the constitutional medium : but then this medium must be pure , it must transmit every object in its real form and its natural colours .
This is all that is now contended for .
You are called to the exercise of your just right of inquiry , that his majesty may see what reason there is for this general inquietude .


This motion is of a general nature  whom it may more particularly affect , I shall not determine .
But there is a great person , lately at the head of the administration , who stands foremost , the principal object of national suspicion .
He surely will not decline this inquiry , it is his own proposition  he has frequently , in the name of the whole administration , thrown down his gauntlet here  has desired your inquiries , and has rested his fate on your justice .
The nation accepts the challenge , they join issue with him , they are now desirous to bring this great cause in judgment before you .


It must be imputed to the long intermission of this right of inquiry , that the people have now this cause of complaint  had the administration of this great person been submitted to the constitutional controls , had his conduct undergone strict and frequent inquiries , he had parts and abilities to have done great honour and service to this country .
But the will , uncontrouled , for ever must and will produce security and wantonness  nor can moderation and despotick power subsist long together .


In vain do we admire the outlines of our constitution , in vain do we boast of those wise and salutary restraints , which our ancestors , at the expense of their blood and treasure , have wisely imposed upon monarchy itself , if it is to be a constitution in theory only , if this evasive doctrine is to be admitted , that a fellow-subject of our own , perhaps of the lowest rank among us , may be delegated by the crown to exercise the administration of government , with absolute , uncontroulable dominion over us  which must be the case , if ministerial conduct is not liable to parliamentary inquiries .


If I did not think this motion agreeable to the rules and proceedings of the senate  if I thought it was meant to introduce any procedure which was not strictly consonant to the laws and constitution of my country , I do most solemnly protest I would be against , it .
But as I apprehend it to arise from the nature and spirit of our constitution , as it will defend the innocent , and can be detrimental only to the guilty , I do most heartily second the motion .


The hon. Henry PELHAM opposed the motion to the following effect : -- Sir , if it was not daily to be observed , how much the minds of the wisest and most moderate men are elated with success , and how often those , who have been able to surmount the strongest obstacles with unwearied diligence , and to preserve their fortitude unshaken amidst hourly disappointments , have been betrayed by slight advantages into indecent exultations , unreasonable confidence , and chimerical hopes  had I not long remarked the infatuation of prosperity , and the pride of triumph , I should not have heard the motion which has been now made without , astonishment .


It has been long the business or the amusement of the gentlemen , who , having for some time conferred upon themselves the venerable titles of patriots , advocates for the people , and defenders of the constitution , have at length persuaded part of the nation to dignify them with the same appellation , to display in the most pathetick language , and aggravate with the most hyperbolical exaggerations , the wantonness with which the late ministry exercised their power , the exorbitance of their demands , and the violence of their measures .
They have indulged their imaginations , which have always been sufficiently fruitful in satire and invective , by representing them as men in whom all regard to decency or reputation was extinguished , men who no longer submitted to wear the mask of hypocrisy , or thought the esteem of mankind worth their care  who had ceased to profess any regard to the welfare of their country , or any desire of advancing the publick happiness  and who no longer desired any other effects of their power , than the security of themselves and the conquest of their opponents .


Such , sir , has been the character of the ministry , which , by the incessant endeavours of these disinterested patriots , has been carried to the remotest corners of the empire , and disseminated through all the degrees of the people .
Every man , whom they could enlist among their pupils , whom they could persuade to see with their eyes , rather than his own , and who was not so stubborn as to require proofs of their assertions , and reasons of their conduct  every man who , having no sentiments of his own , hoped to become important by echoing those of his instructors , was taught to think and to say , that the court was filled with open corruption  that the greatest and the wisest men of the kingdom set themselves publickly to sale , and held an open traffick for votes and places  that whoever engaged in the party of the minister , declared himself ready to support his cause against truth , and reason , and conviction , and was no longer under the restraint of shame or virtue .


These assertions , hardy as they were , they endeavoured to support by instances of measures , which they described as having no other tendency , than to advance the court to absolute authority , to enslave the nation , or to betray it : and more happily would they have propagated their system , and much sooner would they have obtained a general declaration of the people in their favour , had they been able to have produced a motion like this .


Should the influence of these men increase , should they grow secure in the possession of their power , by any new methods of deluding the people , what wonderful expedients , what unheard-of methods of government may not be expected from them ?
What degrees of violence may they not be supposed to practise , who have flushed their new authority by a motion which was never projected since the first existence of our government , or offered by the most arbitrary minister in all the confidence of an established majority .


It may , perhaps , be imagined by many of those who are unacquainted with senatorial affairs , as many of the members of this house may without any reproach be supposed to be , that I have made use of those arts against the patriots which they have so long practised against the court  that I have exaggerated the enormity of the motion by unjust comparisons , or rhetorical flights  and that there will be neither danger nor inconvenience in complying with it to any but those who have betrayed their trust , or neglected their duty .


I doubt not , but many of those with whom this motion has been concerted , have approved it without seeing all its consequences  and have been betrayed into that approbation by a laudable zeal for their country , and an honest indignation against corruption and treachery , by a virtuous desire of detecting wickedness , and of securing our constitution from any future dangers or attacks .


For the sake , therefore , of these gentlemen , whom I can not but suppose willing to follow the dictates of their own consciences , and to act upon just motives , I shall endeavour to lay open the nature of this extraordinary motion , and doubt not but that when they find it , as it will unquestionably appear , unreasonable in itself , and dangerous to posterity , they will change their opinion for the same reasons as they embraced it , and prefer the happiness of their country to the prosperity of their party .


Against an inquiry into the conduct of all foreign and domestick affairs for twenty years past , it is no weak argument that it is without precedent  that neither the zeal of patriotism , nor the rage of faction , ever produced such a motion in any former age .
It can not be doubted by those who have read our histories , that formerly our country has produced men equally desirous of detecting wickedness , and securing liberty , with those who are now congratulating their constituents on the success of their labours  and that faction has swelled in former times to a height , at which it may reasonably be hoped it will never arrive again , is too evident to be controverted .


What then can we suppose was the reason , that neither indignation , nor integrity , nor resentment , ever before directed a motion like this ?
Was it not , because it neither will serve the purposes of honesty , nor wickedness  that it would have defeated the designs of good , and betrayed those of bad men  that it would have given patriotism an appearance of faction , rather than have vested faction with the disguise of patriotism .


It can not be supposed , that the sagacity of these gentlemen , however great , has enabled them to discover a method of proceeding which escaped the penetration of our ancestors , so long celebrated for the strength of their understanding , and the extent of their knowledge .
For it is evident , that without any uncommon effort of the intellectual faculties , he that proposes an inquiry for a year past , might have made the same proposal with regard to a longer time  and it is therefore probable , that the limitation of the term is the effect of his knowledge , rather than of his ignorance .


And , indeed , the absurdity of an universal inquiry for twenty years past is such , that no man , whose station has given him opportunities of being acquainted with publick business , could have proposed it , had he not been misled by the vehemence of resentment , or biassed by the secret operation of some motives different from publick good  for it is no less than a proposal for an attempt impossible to be executed , and of which the execution , if it could be effected would be detrimental to the publick .


Were our nation , sir , like some of the inland kingdoms of the continent , or the barbarous empire of Japan , without commerce , without alliances , without taxes , and without competition with other nations  did we depend only on the product of our own soil to support us , and the strength of our own arms to defend us , without any intercourse with distant empire , or any solicitude about foreign affairs , were the same measures uniformly pursued , the government supported by the same revenues , and administered with the same views , it might not be impracticable to examine the conduct of affairs , both foreign and domestick , for twenty years  because every year would afford only a transcript of the accounts of the last .


But how different is the state of Britain , a nation whose traffick is extended over the earth , whose revenues are every year different , or differently applied , which is daily engaging in new treaties of alliance , or forming new regulations of trade with almost every nation , however distant , which has undertaken the arduous and intricate employments of superintending the interests of all foreign empires , and maintaining the equipoise of the French powers , which receives ambassadors from all the neighbouring princes , and extends its regard to the limits of the world .


In such a nation , every year produces negotiations of peace , or preparations for war , new schemes and different measures , by which expenses are sometimes increased , and sometimes retrenched .
In such a nation , every thing is in a state of perpetual vicissitude  because its measures are seldom the effects of choice , but of necessity , arising from the change of conduct in other powers .


Nor is the multiplicity and intricacy of our domestick affairs less remarkable or particular .
It is too well known that our debts are great , and our taxes numerous  that our funds , appropriated to particular purposes , are at some times deficient , and at others redundant  and that therefore the money arising from the same imposts , is differently applied in different years .
To assert that this fluctuation produces intricacy , may be imagined a censure of those to whose care our accounts are committed  but surely it must be owned , that our accounts are made necessarily less uniform and regular , and such as must require a longer time for a complete examination .


Whoever shall set his foot in our offices , and observe the number of papers with which the transactions of the last twenty years have filled them , will not need any arguments against this motion .
When he sees the number of writings which such an inquiry will make necessary to be perused , compared , and extracted , the accounts which must be examined and opposed to others , the intelligence from foreign courts which must be considered , and the estimates of domestick expenses which must be discussed  he will own , that whoever is doomed to the task of this inquiry , would be happy in exchanging his condition with that of the miners of America  and that the most resolute industry , however excited by ambition , or animated by patriotism , must sink under the weight of endless labour .


If it be considered how many are employed in the publick offices , it must be confessed , either that the national treasure is squandered in salaries upon men who have no employment , or that twenty years may be reasonably supposed to produce more papers than a committee can examine  and , indeed , if the committee of inquiry be not more numerous than has ever been appointed , it may be asserted , without exaggeration , that the inquiry into our affairs for twenty years past , will not be accurately performed in less than twenty years to come  in which time those whose conduct is now supposed to have given the chief occasion to this motion , may be expected to be removed for ever from the malice of calumny , and the rage of persecution .


But if it should be imagined by those who , having never been engaged in publick affairs , can not properly judge of their intricacy and extent , that such an inquiry is in reality so far from being impossible , that it is only the work of a few months , and that the labour of it will be amply recompensed by the discoveries which it will produce , let them but so long suspend the gratification of their curiosity , as to consider the nature of that demand by which they are about to satisfy it .
A demand , by which nothing less is required than that all the secrets of our government should be made publick .


It is known in general to every man , whose employment or amusement it has been to consider the state of the French kingdoms , that the last twenty years have been a time not of war , but of negotiations  a period crowned with projects , and machinations often more dangerous than violence and invasions  and that these projects have been counteracted by opposite schemes , that treaties have been defeated by treaties , and one alliance overbalanced by another .


Such a train of transactions , in which almost every court of France has been engaged , must have given occasion to many private conferences , and secret negotiations  many designs must have been discovered by informers who gave their intelligence at the hazard of their lives , and been defeated , sometimes by secret stipulations , and sometimes by a judicious distribution of money to those who presided in senates or councils .


Every man must immediately be convinced , that by the inquiry now proposed , all these secrets will be brought to light  that one prince will be informed of the treachery of his servants , and another see his own cowardice or venality exposed to the world .
It is plain , that the channels of intelligence will be for ever stopped , and that no prince will enter into private treaties with a monarch who is denied by the constitution of his empire , the privilege of concealing his own measures .
It is evident , that our enemies may hereafter plot our ruin in full security , and that our allies will no longer treat us with confidence .


Since , therefore , the inquiry now demanded is impossible , the motion ought to be rejected , as it can have no other tendency than to expose the senate and the nation to ridicule  and since , if it could be performed , it would produce consequences fatal to our government , as it would expose our most secret measures to our enemies , and weaken the confidence of our allies .
I hope every man who regards either his own reputation , or that of the senate , or professes any solicitude for the publick good , will oppose the motion .


Lord QUARENDON spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I am always inclined to suspect a man who endeavours rather to terrify than persuade .
Exaggerations and hyperboles are seldom made use of by him who has any real arguments to produce .
The reasonableness of this motion ( of which I was convinced when I first heard it , and of which , I believe , no man can doubt who is not afraid of the inquiry proposed by it ) is now , in my opinion , evinced by , the weak opposition which has been made by the honourable gentleman , to whose abilities I can not deny this attestation , that the cause which he can not defend , has very little to hope from any other advocate .


And surely he can not , even by those who , whenever he speaks , stand prepared to applaud him , be thought to have produced any formidable argument against the inquiry , who has advanced little more than that it is impossible to be performed .


Impossibility is a formidable sound to ignorance and cowardice  but experience has often discovered , that it is only a sound uttered by those who have nothing else to say  and courage readily surmounts those obstacles that sink the lazy and timorous into despair .


That there are , indeed , impossibilities in nature , can not be denied .
There may be schemes formed which no wise man will attempt to execute , because he will know that they can not succeed  but , surely , the examination of arithmetical deductions , or the consideration of treaties and conferences , can not be admitted into the number of impossible designs  unless , as it may sometimes happen , the treaties and calculations are unintelligible .


The only difficulty that can arise , must be produced by the confusion and perplexity of our publick transactions , the inconsistency of our treaties , and the fallaciousness of our estimates  but I hope no man will urge these as arguments against the motion .
An inquiry ought to be promoted , that confusion may be reduced to order , and that the distribution of the publick money may be regulated .
If the examination be difficult , it ought to be speedily performed , because those difficulties are daily increasing  if it be impossible , it ought to be attempted , that those methods of forming calculations may be changed , which make them impossible to be examined .


Mr. FOWKES replied in the manner following : -- Sir , to treat with contempt those arguments which can not readily be answered , is the common practice of disputants  but as it is contrary to that candour and ingenuity which is inseparable from zeal for justice and love of truth , it always raises a suspicion of private views , and of designs , which , however they may be concealed by specious appearances , and vehement professions of integrity and sincerity , tend in reality to the promotion of some secret interest , or the gratification of some darling passion .
It is reasonable to imagine , that he , who in the examination of publick questions , calls in the assistance of artifice and sophistry , is actuated rather by the rage of persecution , than the ardour of patriotism  that he is pursuing an enemy , rather than detecting a criminal  and that he declaims against the abuse of power in another , only that he may more easily obtain it himself .


In senatorial debates , I have often known this method of easy confutation practised , sometimes with more success , and sometimes with less .
I have often known ridicule of use , when reason has been baffled , and seen those affect to despise their opponents , who have been able to produce nothing against them but artful allusions to past debates , satirical insinuations of dependence , or hardy assertions unsupported by proofs .
By these arts I have known the young and unexperienced kept in suspense  I have seen the cautious and diffident taught to doubt of the plainest truths  and the bold and sanguine persuaded to join in the cry , and hunt down reason , after the example of their leaders .


But a bolder attempt to disarm argument of its force , and to perplex the understanding , has not often been made , than this which I am now endeavouring to oppose .
A motion has been made and seconded for an inquiry , to which it is objected , not that it is illegal , not that it is inconvenient , not that it is unnecessary , but that it is impossible .
An objection more formidable can not , in my opinion , easily be made  nor can it be imagined that those men would think any other worthy of an attentive examination , who can pass over this as below their regard  yet even this has produced no answer , but contemptuous raillery , and violent exclamation .


What arguments these gentlemen require , it is not easy to conjecture  or how those who disapprove their measures , may with any hope of success dispute against them .
Those impetuous spirits that break so easily through the bars of impossibility , will scarcely suffer their career to be stopped by any other restraint  and it may be reasonably feared , that arguments from justice , or law , or policy , will have little force upon these daring minds , who in the transports of their newly acquired victory , trample impossibility under their feet , and imagine that to those who have vanquished the ministry , every thing is practicable .


That this inquiry would be the work of years  that it will employ greater numbers than were ever deputed by this house on such an occasion before  that it would deprive the nation of the counsels of the wisest and most experienced members of this house , ( for such only ought to be chosen , ) at a time when all Europe is in arms , when our allies are threatened not only with subjection , but annihilation  when the French are reviving their ancient schemes , and projecting the conquest of the continent  and that it will , therefore , interrupt our attention to more important affairs , and disable us from rescuing our confederates , is incontestably evident  nor can the wisest or the most experienced determine how far its consequences may extend , or inform us , whether it may not expose our commerce to be destroyed by the Spaniards , and the liberties of all the nations round us to be infringed by the French  whether it may not terminate in the loss of our independence , and the destruction of our religion .


Such are the effects which may be expected from an attempt to make the inquiry proposed  effects , to which no proportionate advantages can be expected from it , since it has been already shown , that it can never be completed  and to which , though the indefatigable industry of curiosity or malice should at length break through all obstacles , and lay all the transactions of twenty years open to the world , no discoveries would be equivalent .


That any real discoveries of misconduct would be made , that the interest of our country would be found ever to have been lazily neglected , or treacherously betrayed , that any of our rights have been either yielded by cowardice , or sold by avarice , or that our enemies have gained any advantage over us by the connivance or ignorance of our ministers , I am indeed very far from believing  but as I am now endeavouring to convince those of the impropriety of this motion , who have long declared themselves of a different opinion , it may not be improper to ask , what advantage they propose by detecting errours of twenty years , which are now irretrievable  of inquiring into fraudulent practices , of which the authors and the agents are now probably in their graves  and exposing measures , of which all the inconveniencies have been already felt , and which have now ceased to affect us .


If it be wise to neglect our present interest for the sake of inquiring into past miscarriages , and the inquiry now proposed be in itself possible , I have no objections to the present motion  but as I think the confused state of Europe demands our utmost attention , and the prosecution of the war against Spain is in itself of far more importance than the examination of all past transactions , I can not but think , that the duty which I owe to my country requires that I should declare myself unwilling to concur in any proposal , that may unnecessarily divert our thoughts or distract our councils .


Lord PERCIVAL then rose and spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , to discourage good designs by representations of the danger of attempting , and the difficulty of executing them , has been , at all times , the practice of those whose interest has been threatened by them .
A pirate never fails to intimidate his pursuers by exaggerating the number and resolution of his crew , the strength of his vessels , and the security of his retreats .
A cheat discourages a prosecution by dwelling upon his knowledge of all the arts and subterfuges of the law , the steadiness of his witnesses , and the experience of his agents .


To raise false terrours by artful appearances is part of the art of war , nor can the general be denied praise , who by an artful disposition of a small body , discourages those enemies from attacking him by whom he would certainly be overcome  but then , surely the appearance ought to be such as may reasonably be expected to deceive  for a stratagem too gross only produces contempt and confidence , and adds the vexation of being ridiculous to the calamity of being defeated .


Whether this will be the fate of the advocates for the ministry , I am not able to determine  but surely they have forgot the resolution with which their enemies bore up for many years against their superiority , and the conduct by which at last they defeated the united influence of power and money  if they hope to discourage them from an attack , by representing the bulk and strength of their paper fortifications .
They have lost all memory of the excise and the convention , who can believe their eloquence sufficiently powerful to evince , that the inquiry now proposed ought to be numbered among impossibilities .


Whoever , sir , is acquainted with their methods of negotiation , will , indeed , easily believe the papers sufficiently numerous , and the task of examining them such as no man would willingly undertake  for it does not appear for what end the immense sums which late senates have granted , were expended , except for the payment of secretaries , and ministers , and couriers .
But whatever care has been employed to perplex every transaction with useless circumstances , and to crowd every office with needless papers , it will be long before they convince us , that it is impossible to examine them .
They may , doubtless , be in time perused , though , perhaps , they can never be understood .


The utmost inconvenience , sir , that can be feared , is the necessity of engaging a greater number of hands than on former occasions  and it will be no disagreeable method to the publick , if we employ some of the clerks which have been retained only for the sake of gratifying the leaders of boroughs , or advancing the distant relations of the defenders of the ministry , in unravelling those proceedings which they have been hitherto hired only to embarrass , and in detecting some of those abuses to which the will of their masters has made them instrumental  that they may at last deserve , in some degree , the salaries which they have enjoyed , may requite the publick for their part of its spoils , by contributing to the punishment of the principal plunderers , and leave their offices , of which I hope the number will be quickly diminished , with the satisfaction of having deserved at last the thanks of their country .


By this expedient , sir , the inquiry will be made at least possible , and I hope , though it should still remain difficult , those who have so long struggled for the preservation of their country , and who have at last seen their labours rewarded with success , will not be discouraged from pursuing it .


The necessity of such an inquiry will grow every day more urgent  because wicked men will be hardened in confidence of impunity , and the difficulty , such as it is , will be increased by every delay  for what now makes an inquiry difficult , or in the style of these mighty politicians impossible , but the length of time that has elapsed since the last exertion of this right of the senate , and the multitude of transactions which are necessarily to be examined ?


What is this year an irksome and tedious task , will in another year require still more patience and labour  and though I can not believe that it will ever become impossible , it will undoubtedly in time be sufficient to weary the most active industry , and to discourage the most ardent zeal .


The chief argument , therefore , that has been hitherto employed to discourage us from an inquiry , ought rather , in my opinion , to incite us to it .
We ought to remember , that while the enemies of our country are fortifying themselves behind an endless multiplicity of negotiations and accounts , every day adds new strength to their intrenchments , and that we ought to force them while they are yet unable to resist or escape us .


Sir William YONGE then spoke to the following effect : -- Sir , however I may be convinced in my own opinion of the impracticability of the inquiry now proposed , whatever confidence I may repose in the extensive knowledge and long experience of those , by whom it has been openly pronounced not only difficult but impossible , I think there are arguments against the motion , which though , perhaps , not stronger in themselves , ( for what objection can be stronger than impossibility , ) ought at least more powerfully to incite us to oppose it .


Of the impossibility of executing this inquiry , those who have proposed it well deserve to be convinced , not by arguments but experience  they deserve not to be diverted by persuasions from engaging in a task , which they have voluntarily determined to undergo  a task , which neither honour , nor virtue , nor necessity has imposed upon them , and to which it may justly be suspected , that they would not have submitted upon any other motives , than those by which their conduct has hitherto been generally directed , ambition and resentment .


Men who , upon such principles , condemn themselves to labours which they can not support , surely deserve to perish in the execution of their own projects , to be overwhelmed by the burdens which they have laid upon themselves , and to suffer the disgrace which always attends the undertakers of impossibilities  and from which the powers of raillery and ridicule , which they have so successfully displayed on this occasion , will not be sufficient to defend them .


They have , indeed , sir , with great copiousness of language , and great fertility of imagination , shown the weakness of supposing this inquiry impossible  they have proposed a method of performing it , which they hope will at once confute and irritate their opponents  but all their raillery and all their arguments have in reality been thrown away upon an attempt to confute what never was advanced .
They have first mistaken the assertion which they oppose , and then exposed its absurdity  they have introduced a bugbear , and then attempted to signalize their courage and their abilities , by showing that it can not fright them .


The honourable gentleman , sir , who first mentioned to you the impossibility of this inquiry , spoke only according to the common acceptation of words , and was far from intending to imply natural and philosophical impossibility .
He was far from intending to insinuate , that to examine any series of transactions , or peruse any number of papers , implied an absurdity , or contrariety to the established order of nature  he did not intend to rank this design with those of building in the air , or pumping out the ocean  he intended only to assert a moral or popular impossibility , to show that the scheme was not practicable but by greater numbers than could be conveniently employed upon it , or in a longer space of time than it was rational to assign to it  as we say it is impossible to raise groves upon rocks , or build cities in deserts  by which we mean only to imply , that there is no proportion between the importance of the effect , and the force of the causes which must operate to produce it  that the toil will be great , and the advantage little .


In this sense , sir , and nothing but malice or perverseness could have discovered any other , the motion may be truly said to be impossible  but its impossibility ought to be rather the care of those who make , than of those that oppose it  and , therefore , I shall lay before the house other reasons , which , unless they can be answered , will determine me to vote against it .


It can not be doubted , but the papers which must on this occasion be examined , contain a great number of private transactions , which the interest of the nation , and the honour of our sovereign require to be concealed .
The system of policy which the French have , within the last century , introduced into the world , has made negotiation more necessary than in any preceding time .
What was formerly performed by fleets and armies , by invasions , sieges , and battles , has been of late accomplished by more silent methods .
Empires have been enlarged without bloodshed , and nations reduced to distress without the ravages of hostile armies , by the diminution of their commerce , and the alienation of their allies .


For this reason , sir , it has been necessary frequently to engage in private treaties , to obviate designs sometimes justly , and at other times , perhaps , unreasonably suspected .
It has been proper to act upon remote suppositions , and to conclude alliances which were only to be publickly owned , in consequence of measures taken by some other powers , which measures were sometimes laid aside , and the treaty , therefore , was without effect .
In some of these provisionary contracts , it is easy to conceive , that designs were formed not to the advantage of some powers , whom yet we do not treat as enemies , which were only to be made publick by the execution of them : in others , perhaps , some concessions were made to us , in consideration of the assistance that we promised , by which the weakness of our allies may be discovered , and which we can not disclose without making their enemies more insolent , and increasing that danger from which they apply to us for security and protection .


If to this representation of the nature of the papers , with which our offices have been filled by the negotiations of the last twenty years , any thing were necessary to be added , it may be farther alleged , that it has long been the practice of every nation on this side of the globe , to procure private intelligence of the designs and expectations of the neighbouring powers , to penetrate into the councils of princes and the closets of ministers , to discover the instructions of ambassadours , and the orders of generals , to learn the intention of fleets before they are equipped , and of armies before they are levied , and to provide not only against immediate and visible hostilities , but to obviate remote and probable dangers .


It need not be declared in this assembly , that this can not always be done without employing men who abuse the confidence reposed in them , a practice on which I shall not at this time trouble the house with my opinion , nor interrupt the present debate , by any attempt to justify or condemn it .
This , I think , may be very reasonably alleged  that whether the employment of such persons be defensible by the reciprocal practice of nations , or not , it becomes at least those that corrupt them and pay them for their treachery , not to expose them to vengeance , to torture , or to ruin  not to betray those crimes which they have hired them to commit , or give them up to punishment , to which they have made themselves liable only by their instigation , and for their advantage .


That private compacts between nations and sovereigns ought to be kept inviolably secret , can not be doubted by any man who considers , that secrecy is one of the conditions of those treaties , without which they had not been concluded  and , therefore , that to discover them is to violate them , to break down the securities of human society , to destroy mutual trust , and introduce into the world universal confusion .
For nothing less can be produced by a disregard of those ties which link nations in confederacies , and produce confidence and security , and which enable the weak , by union , to resist the attacks of powerful ambition .


How much it would injure the honour of our sovereign to be charged with the dissolution of concord , and the subversion of the general bulwarks of publick faith , it is superfluous to explain .
To know the condition to which a compliance with this motion would reduce the British nation , we need only turn our eyes downwards upon the hourly scenes of common life  we need only attend to the occurrences which crowd perpetually upon our view , and consider the calamitous state of that man , of whom it is generally known that he can not be trusted , and that secrets communicated to him are in reality scattered among mankind .


Every one knows that such a man can expect none of the advantages or pleasures of friendship , that he can not transact affairs with others upon terms of equality , that he must purchase the favours of those that are more powerful than himself , and frighten those into compliance with his designs who have any thing to fear from him  that he must give uncommon security for the performance of his covenants , that he can have no influence but that of money , which will probably become every day less , that his success will multiply his enemies , and that in misfortunes he will be without refuge .


The condition of nations collectively considered is not different from that of private men , their prosperity is produced by the same conduct , and their calamities drawn upon them by the same errours , negligences , or crimes  and therefore , since he that betrays secrets in private life , indisputably forfeits his claim to trust , and since he that can be no longer trusted is on the brink of ruin , I can not but conclude that , as by this motion all the secrets of our government must be inevitably betrayed , my duty to his majesty , my love of my country , and my obligations to discharge with fidelity the trust which my constituents have conferred upon me , oblige me to oppose it .


Mr. LITTLETON then rose , and spoke to this effect : -- Sir , it always portends well to those who dispute on the side of truth and reason , when their opponents appear not wholly to be hardened against the force of argument , when they seem desirous to gain the victory , not by superiority of numbers but of reason , and attempt rather to convince , than to terrify or bribe .
For though men are not in quest of truth themselves , nor desirous to point it out to others  yet , while they are obliged to speak with an appearance of sincerity , they must necessarily afford the unprejudiced and attentive an opportunity of discovering the right .
While they think themselves under a necessity of reasoning , they can not but show the force of a just argument , by the unsuccessfulness of their endeavours to confute it , and the propriety of an useful and salutary motion , by the slight objections which they raise against it .
They can not but find themselves sometimes forced to discover what they can never be expected to acknowledge , the weakness of their own reasons , by deserting them when they are pressed with contrary assertions , and seeking a subterfuge in new arguments equally inconclusive and contemptible .
They show the superiority of their opponents , like other troops , by retreating before them , and forming one fortification behind another , in hopes of wearying those whom they can not hope to repulse .


Of this conduct we have had already an instance in the present debate  a debate managed with such vigour , order , and resolution , as sufficiently shows the advantage of regular discipline long continued , and proves , that troops may retain their skill and spirit , even when they are deprived of that leader , to whose instructions and example they were indebted for them .
When first this motion was offered , it seems to have been their chief hope to divert us from it by outcries of impossibility , by representing it as the demand of men unacquainted with the state of our offices , or the multiplicity of transactions , in which the indefatigable industry of our ministers has been employed  and they have therefore endeavoured to persuade us , that they are only discouraging us from an insuperable labour , and advising us to desist from measures which we can not live to accomplish .


But when they found , sir , that their exaggerations produced merriment instead of terrour , that their opponents were determined to try their strength against impossibility , that they were resolved to launch out into this boundless ocean of inquiry  an ocean of which they have been boldly told , that it has neither shore nor bottom , and that whoever ventures into it must be tost about for life  when they discovered that this was not able to shake our resolution , or move us to any other disposition , they thought it proper to explain away their assertion of impossibility , by making a kind of distinction between things impossible , and things which can not be performed  and finding it necessary to enlarge their plea , they have now asserted , that this inquiry is both impossible and inexpedient .


Its impossibility , sir , has been already sufficiently discussed , and shown to mean only a difficulty which the unskilfulness of our ministers has produced  for transactions can only produce difficulties to the inquirer , when they are confused  and confusion can only be the effect of ignorance or neglect .


Artifice is , indeed , one more source of perplexity : it is the interest of that man whose cause is bad to speak unintelligibly in the defence of it , and of him whose actions can not bear to be examined , to hide them in disorder , to engage his pursuers in a labyrinth , that they may not trace his steps and discover his retreat  and what intricacies may be produced by fraud cooperating with subtilty , it is not possible to tell .


I do not , however , believe , that all the art of wickedness can elude the inquiries of a British senate , quickened by zeal for the publick happiness .
The sagacity of our predecessors has often detected crimes concealed with more policy than can be ascribed to those whose conduct is now to be examined , and dragged the authors of national calamities to punishment from their darkest retreats .
The expediency , therefore , of this motion , is now to be considered , and surely it will not require long reflection to prove that it is proper , when the nation is oppressed with calamities , to inquire by what misconduct they were brought upon it  when immense sums have been raised by the most oppressive methods of exaction , to ask why they were demanded , and how they were expended  when penal laws have been partially executed , to examine by what authority they were suspended , and by what they were enforced  and when the senate has for twenty years implicitly obeyed the direction of one man , when it has been known throughout the nation , before any question was proposed , how it would be decided , to search out the motive of that regular compliance , and to examine whether the minister was reverenced for his wisdom and virtue , or feared for his power , or courted for the publick money  whether he owed his prevalence to the confidence or corruption of his followers ?


It can not surely be thought inexpedient , to inquire into the reasons for which our merchants were for many years suffered to be plundered , or for which a war , solicited by the general voice of the whole nation , was delayed  into the reasons for which our fleets were fitted out only to coast upon the ocean , and connive at the departure of squadrons and the transportation of armies , to suffer our allies to be invaded , and our traders ruined and enslaved .


It is , in my opinion , convenient to examine with the utmost rigour , why time was granted to our enemies to fortify themselves against us , while a standing army preyed upon our people ?
Why forces unacquainted with the use of arms were sent against them , under the command of leaders equally ignorant ?
And why we have suffered their privateers in the mean time to rove at large over the ocean , and insult us upon our own coasts ?
Why we did not rescue our sailors from captivity , when opportunities of exchange were in our power ?
And why we robbed our merchants of their crews by rigorous impresses , without employing them either to guard our trade , or subdue our enemies ?


If the senate is not to be suffered to inquire into affairs like these , it is no longer any security to the people , that they have the right of electing representatives  and unless they may carry their inquiries back as far as they shall think it necessary , the most acute sagacity may be easily eluded  causes may be very remote from their consequences , the original motives of a long train of wicked measures may lie hid in some private transaction of former years , and those advantages which our enemies have been of late suffered to obtain , were perhaps sold them at some forgotten congress by some secret article .


Such are , probably , the private transactions which the honourable gentleman is so much afraid of exposing to the light  transactions in which the interest of this nation has been meanly yielded up by cowardice , or sold by treachery  in which Britain has been considered as a province subordinate to some other country , or in which the minister has enriched himself by the sacrifice of the publick rights .


It has been , indeed , alleged with some degree of candour , that many of our treaties were provisions against invasions which perhaps were never intended , and calculated to defeat measures which only our own cowardice disposed us to fear .
That such treaties have , indeed , been made , Hanover is a sufficient witness  but however frequently they may occur , they may surely be discovered with very little disadvantage to the nation  they will prove only the weakness of those that made them , who were at one time intimidated by chimerical terrours , and at another , lulled into confidence by airy security .


The concessions from foreign powers , which have been likewise mentioned , ought surely not to be produced as arguments against the motion  for what could more excite the curiosity of the nation , if , indeed , this motion were in reality produced by malevolence or resentment  if none were expected to concur in it but those who envied the abilities , or had felt the power of the late minister , it might be , perhaps , defeated by such insinuations  for nothing could more certainly regain his reputation , or exalt him to more absolute authority , than proofs that he had obtained for us any concessions from foreign powers .


If any advantageous terms have been granted us , he must be confessed to have so far discharged his trust to his allies , that he has kept them with the utmost caution from the knowledge of the people , who have heard , during all his administration , of nothing but subsidies , submission , and compliances paid to almost every prince on the continent who has had the confidence to demand them  and if by this inquiry any discovery to the disadvantage of our allies should be struck out , he may with great sincerity allege , that it was made without his consent .


Another objection to this inquiry is , that the spies which are retained in foreign courts may be detected by it , that the canals of our intelligence will be for ever stopped , and that we shall henceforth have no knowledge of the designs of foreign powers , but what may be honestly attained by penetration and experience .
Spies are , indeed , a generation for whose security I have not much regard , but for whom I am on this occasion less solicitous , as I believe very few of them will be affected by this motion .


The conduct of our ministers has never discovered such an acquaintance with the designs of neighbouring princes , as could be suspected to be obtained by any uncommon methods , or they have very little improved the opportunities which early information put into their power  for they have always been baffled and deceived .
Either they have employed no spies , or their spies have been directed to elude them by false intelligence , or true intelligence has been of no use  and if any of these assertions be true , the publick will not suffer by the motion .


It was justly observed , by the honourable gentleman , that a parallel may be properly drawn between a nation and a private man , and , by consequence , between a trading nation and a trader .
Let us , therefore , consider what must be the state of that trader who shall never inspect or state his accounts , who shall suffer his servants to traffick in the dark with his stock , and on his credit , and who shall permit them to transact bargains in his name , without inquiring whether they are advantageous , or whether they are performed .


Every man immediately marks out a trader thus infatuated , as on the brink of bankruptcy and ruin  every one will easily foresee , that his servants will take advantage of his credulity , and proceed hourly to grosser frauds  that they will grow rich by betraying his interest , that they will neglect his affairs to promote their own , that they will plunder him till he has nothing left , and seek then for employment among those to whom they have recommended themselves by selling their trust .
His neighbours , who easily foresee his approaching misery , retire from him by degrees , disunite their business from his , and leave him to fall , without involving others in his ruin .


Such must be the fate of a trader whom idleness , or a blind confidence in the integrity of others , hinders from attending to his own affairs , unless he rouses from his slumber , and recovers from his infatuation .
And what is to be done by the man who , having for more than twenty years neglected so necessary an employment , finds , what must necessarily be found in much less time , his accounts perplexed , his credit depressed , and his affairs disordered ?
What remains , but that he suffer that disorder to proceed no farther , that he resolutely examine all the transactions which he has hitherto overlooked , that he repair those errours which are yet retrievable , and reduce his trade into method  that he doom those servants , by whom he has been robbed or deceived , to the punishment which they deserve , and recover from them that wealth which they have accumulated by rapacity and fraud .


By this method only can the credit of the trader or the nation be repaired , and this is the method which the motion recommends  a motion with which , therefore , every man may be expected to comply , who desires that his country should once more recover its influence and power , who wishes to see Britain again courted and feared , and her monarch considered as the arbiter of the world , the protector of the true religion , and the defender of the liberties of mankind .


Mr. PHILLIPS spoke in substance as follows : -- Sir , I am so far from believing that there is danger of exposing the spies of the government to the resentment of foreign princes , by complying with this motion , that I suspect the opposition to be produced chiefly from a consciousness , that no spies will be discovered to have been employed , and that the secret service for which such large sums have been required , will appear to have been rather for the service of domestick than of foreign traitors , and to have been performed rather in this house than in foreign courts .


Secret service has been long a term of great use to the ministers of this nation  a term of art to which such uncommon efficacy has been hitherto annexed , that the people have been influenced by it to pay taxes , without expecting to be informed how they were applied , having been content with being told , when they inquired after their properties , that they were exhausted and dissipated in secret service .


Secret service I conceive to have originally implied transactions , of which the agents were secret , though the effects were visible .
When MARLBOROUGH defeated the French , when he counteracted all their stratagems , obviated all their designs , and deceived all their expectations , he charged the nation with large sums for secret service , which were , indeed , cheerfully allowed , because the importance and reality of the service were apparent from its effects .
But what advantages can our ministers boast of having obtained in twenty years by the means of their intelligence ?
Or by whom have they , within that period , not been deceived by false appearances ?
When we purchase secret service at so dear a rate , let it appear that we really obtain what we pay for , though the means by which it is obtained are kept impenetrably secret .
Wherever the usefulness of the intelligence is not discoverable , it is surely just to inquire , whether our money is not demanded for other purposes , whether we are not in reality hiring with our own money armies to enslave , or senators to betray us  or enriching an avaricious minister , while we imagine ourselves contributing to the publick security ?


Colonel CHOLMONDELEY replied to the following effect : -- Sir , it has been in all foregoing ages the custom for men to speak of the government with reverence , even when they opposed its measures , or projected its dissolution  nor has it been thought , in any time before our own , decent or senatorial , to give way to satire or invective , or indulge a petulant imagination , to endeavour to level all orders by contemptuous reflections , or to court the populace , by echoing their language , or adopting their sentiments .


This method of gaining the reputation of patriotism , has been unknown till the present age , and reserved for the present leaders of the people , who will have the honour to stand recorded as the original authors of anarchy , the great subverters of order , and the first men who dared to pronounce , that all the secrets of government ought to be made publick .


It has been hitherto understood in all nations , that those who were intrusted with authority , had likewise a claim to respect and confidence  that they were chosen for the superiority of their abilities , or the reputation of their virtue  and that , therefore , it was reasonable to consign to their management , the direction of such affairs as by their own nature require secrecy .


But this ancient doctrine , by which subordination has been so long preserved , is now to be set aside for new principles , which may flatter the pride , and incite the passions of the people  we are now to be told , that affairs are only kept secret , because they will not bear examination  that men conceal not those transactions in which they have succeeded , but those in which they have failed  that they are only inclined to hide their follies or their crimes , and that to examine their conduct in the most open manner , is only to secure the interest of the publick .


Thus has the nation been taught to expect , that the counsels of the cabinet should be dispersed in the publick papers  that their governours should declare the motives of their measures , and discover the demands of our allies , and the scheme of our policy  and that the people should be consulted upon every emergence , and enjoy the right of instructing not only their own representatives , but the ministers of the crown .


In this debate , the mention of secret treaties has been received with contempt and ridicule  the ministers have been upbraided with chimerical fears , and unnecessary provisions against attacks which never were designed  they have been alleged to have no other interest in view than their own , when they endeavour to mislead inquirers , and to have in reality nothing to keep from publick view but their own ignorance or wickedness .


It can not surely be seriously asserted by men of knowledge and experience , that there are no designs formed by wise governments , of which the success depends upon secrecy  nor can it be asserted , that the inquiry now proposed will betray nothing from which our enemies may receive advantage .


If we should suppose , that all our schemes are either fully accomplished , or irretrievably defeated , it will not even then be prudent to discover them , since they will enable our enemies to form conjectures of the future from the past , and to obviate , hereafter , the same designs , when it shall be thought necessary to resume them .


But , in reality , nothing is more irrational than to suppose this a safer time than any other for such general discoveries  for why should it be imagined , that our engagements are not still depending , and our treaties yet in force ?
And what can be more dishonourable or imprudent , than to destroy at once the whole scheme of foreign policy , to dissolve our alliances , and destroy the effects of such long and such expensive negotiations , without first examining whether they will be beneficial or detrimental to us ?


Nor is it only with respect to foreign affairs that secrecy is necessary  there are , undoubtedly , many domestick transactions which it is not proper to communicate to the whole nation .
There is still a faction among us , which openly desires the subversion of our present establishment  a faction , indeed , not powerful , and which grows , I hope , every day weaker , but which is favoured , or at least imagines itself favoured , by those who have so long distinguished themselves by opposing the measures of the government .
Against these men , whose hopes are revived by every commotion , who studiously heighten every subject of discontent , and add their outcries to every clamour , it is not doubted but measures are formed , by which their designs are discovered , and their measures broken  nor can it be supposed , that this is done without the assistance of some who are received with confidence amongst them , and who probably pass for the most zealous of their party .


Many other domestick occasions of expense might be mentioned  of expense which operates in private , and produces benefits which are only not acknowledged , because they are not known , but which could no longer be applied to the same useful purposes , if the channels through which it passes were laid open .
I can not , therefore , forbear to offer my opinion , that this motion , by which all the secrets of our government will be discovered , will tend to the confusion of the present system of Europe , to the absolute ruin of our interest in foreign courts , and to the embarrassment of our domestick affairs .
I can not , therefore , conceive how any advantages can be expected by the most eager persecutors of the late ministry , which can , even in their opinion , deserve to be purchased at so dear a rate .


Mr. PITT then spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , I know not by what fatality the adversaries of the motion are impelled to assist their adversaries , and contribute to their own overthrow , by suggesting , whenever they attempt to oppose it , new arguments against themselves .


It has been long observed , that when men are drawing near to destruction , they are apparently deprived of their understanding , and contribute by their own folly to those calamities with which they are threatened , but which might , by a different conduct , be sometimes delayed .
This has surely now happened to the veteran advocates for an absolute and unaccountable ministry , who have discovered on this occasion , by the weakness of their resistance , that their abilities are declining  and I can not but hope , that the omen will be fulfilled , and that their infatuation will be quickly followed by their ruin .


To touch in this debate on our domestick affairs , to mention the distribution of the publick money , and to discover their fears , lest the ways in which it has been disbursed , should by this inquiry be discovered  to recall to the minds of their opponents the immense sums which have been annually demanded , and of which no account has been yet given , is surely the lowest degree of weakness and imprudence .


I am so far from being convinced that any danger can arise from this inquiry , that I believe the nation can only be injured by a long neglect of such examinations  and that a minister is easily formidable , when he has exempted himself by a kind of prescription from exposing his accounts , and has long had an opportunity of employing the publick money in multiplying his dependants , enriching his hirelings , enslaving boroughs , and corrupting senates .


That those have been , in reality , the purposes for which the taxes of many years have been squandered , is sufficiently apparent without an inquiry .
We have wasted sums with which the French , in pursuance of their new scheme of increasing their influence , would have been able to purchase the submission of half the nations of the earth , and with which the monarchs of Europe might have been held dependant on a nod  these they have wasted only to sink our country into disgrace , to heighten the spirit of impotent enemies , to destroy our commerce , and distress our colonies .
We have patiently suffered , during a peace of twenty years , those taxes to be extorted from us , by which a war might have been supported against the most powerful nation , and have seen them ingulfed in the boundless expenses of the government , without being able to discover any other effect from them than the establishment of ministerial tyranny .


There has , indeed , been among the followers of the court a regular subordination , and exact obedience  nor has any man been found hardy enough to reject the dictates of the grand vizier .
Every man who has received his pay , has with great cheerfulness complied with his commands  and every man who has held any post or office under the crown , has evidently considered himself as enlisted by the minister .


But the visible influence of places , however destructive to the constitution , is not the chief motive of an inquiry  an inquiry implies something secret , and is intended to discover the private methods of extending dependence , and propagating corruption  the methods by which the people have been influenced to choose those men for representatives whose principles they detest , and whose conduct they condemn  and by which those whom their country has chosen for the guardians of its liberties , have been induced to support , in this house , measures , which in every other place they have made no scruple to censure .


When we shall examine the distribution of the publick treasure , when we shall inquire by what conduct we have been debarred from the honours of war , and at the same time deprived of the blessings of peace , to what causes it is to be imputed , that our debts have continued during the long-continued tranquillity of Europe , nearly in the state to which they were raised by fighting , at our own expense , the general quarrel of mankind  and why the sinking fund , a kind of inviolable deposit appropriated to the payment of our creditors , and the mitigation of our taxes , has been from year to year diverted to very different uses  we shall find that our treasure has been exhausted , not to humble foreign enemies , or obviate domestick insurrections  not to support our allies , or suppress our factions  but for ends which no man , who feels the love of his country yet unextinguished , can name without horrour , the purchase of alliances , and the hire of votes , the corruption of the people , and the exaltation of France .


Such are the discoveries which I am not afraid to declare that I expect from the inquiry , and therefore , I can not but think it necessary .
If those to whom the administration of affairs has been for twenty years committed , have betrayed their trust , if they have invaded the publick rights with the publick treasure , and made use of the dignities which their country has conferred upon them , only to enslave it , who will not confess , that they ought to be delivered up to speedy justice ?
That they ought to be set as landmarks to posterity , to warn those who shall hereafter launch out on the ocean of affluence and power , not to be too confident of a prosperous gale , but to remember , that there are rocks on which whoever rushes must inevitably perish ?
If they are innocent , and far be it from me to declare them guilty without examination , whom will this inquiry injure ?
Or what effects will it produce , but that which every man appears to desire , the reestablishment of the publick tranquillity , a firm confidence in the justice and wisdom of the government , and a general reconciliation of the people to the ministers .


Colonel MORDAUNT spoke then , in substance as follows : -- Sir , notwithstanding the zeal with which the honourable gentleman has urged the necessity of this inquiry , a zeal of which , I think , it may at least be said , that it is too vehement and acrimonious to be the mere result of publick spirit , unmixed with interest or resentment  he has yet been so far unsuccessful in his reasoning , that he has not produced in me any conviction , or weakened any of the impressions which the arguments of those whom he opposes had made upon me .


He has contented himself with recapitulating some of the benefits which may be hoped for from the inquiry  he has represented in the strongest terms , the supposed misconduct of the ministry  he has aggravated all the appearances of wickedness or negligence , and then has inferred the usefulness of a general inquiry for the punishment of past offences , and the prevention of the like practices in future times .


That he has discovered great qualifications for invective , and that his declamation was well calculated to inflame those who have already determined their opinion , and who are , therefore , only restrained from such measures as are now recommended by natural caution and sedateness , I do not deny  but , surely he does not expect to gain proselytes by assertions without proof , or to produce any alteration of sentiments , without attempting to answer the arguments which have been offered against his opinion .


It has been urged with great appearance of reason , that an inquiry , such as is now proposed , with whatever prospects of vengeance , of justice , or of advantage , it may flatter us at a distance , will be in reality detrimental to the publick  because it will discover all the secrets of our government , lay all our negotiations open to the world , will show what powers we most fear , or most trust , and furnish our enemies with means of defeating all our schemes , and counteracting all our measures .


This appears to me , sir , the chief argument against the motion , an argument of which the force can not but be discovered by those whose interest it is to confute it , and of which , therefore , by appearing to neglect it , they seem to confess that it is unanswerable  and therefore , since I can not find the motion justified otherwise than by loud declarations of its propriety , and violent invectives against the ministry , I hope that I shall escape at least the censure of the calm and impartial , though I venture to declare , that I can not approve it  and with regard to the clamorous and the turbulent , I have long learned to despise their menaces , because I have hitherto found them only the boasts of impotence .


Mr. CORNWALL made answer to the following purport : -- Sir , if to obtain the important approbation of the gentleman that spoke last , it be necessary only to answer the argument on which he has insisted , and nothing be necessary to produce an inquiry but his approbation , I shall not despair that this debate may be concluded according to the wishes of the nation , that secret wickedness may be detected , and that our posterity may be secured from any invasion of their liberty , by examples of the vengeance of an injured people .


[ The house divided .
-- The yeas went forth .
-- For the question , 242  against it , 244 : so that it passed in the negative , by a majority of two . ]


HOUSE OF LORDS , MAY 20 , 1742 .


Debate On A Motion For Indemnifying Evidence Relating To The Conduct Of The Earl Of ORFORD .


The following debate having been produced by an occasion very uncommon and important , it is necessary to give an account of such transactions as may contribute to illustrate it .


The prime minister being driven out of the house of commons , by the prevalence of those who , from their opposition to the measures of the court , were termed the country party , it was proposed that a committee should be appointed , `` to inquire into the conduct of publick affairs , at home and abroad , during the last twenty years  '' but the motion was rejected .


It was afterwards moved , `` that a committee should be appointed to inquire into the conduct of Robert , earl of ORFORD , during the last ten years in which he was first commissioner of the treasury , and chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer , '' which was carried by 252 to 245 .


A committee of one-and-twenty being chosen by ballot , and entering upon the inquiry , called before them Mr. Gibbon , who declared himself agent to J. Botteler , and said , that Botteler , being a candidate for Wendover , and finding that no success was to be expected without five hundred pounds , sent a friend to N. Paxton , with a letter , and that he saw him return with a great number of papers , in which he said were bills for five hundred pounds .


Botteler and his friend being examined , confirmed the testimony of Gibbon  and Botteler added , that he sent to Paxton as an officer of the treasury , acquainted with those who had the disposal of money  that his claim to the favour which he asked arose from a disappointment in a former election  that he never gave for the money any security or acknowledgment , nor considered himself indebted for it to Paxton or any other person .


Paxton being then examined , refused to return any answer to the question of the committee , because the answer might tend to accuse himself .
Which reason was alleged by others for a like refusal .


The committee finding their inquiries eluded , by this plea for secrecy , which the laws of Britain allow to be valid , reported to the commons the obstacles that they met with  for the removal of which a bill was brought in like that of indemnity  which , having passed the commons , produced , in the house of lords , a debate , in which the greatest men of each party exerted the utmost force of their reason and eloquence .


The bill being read a second time , and a motion made for its being referred to a committee .


Lord CARTERET spoke to this effect : -- My lords , as the question now before us is of the highest importance both to the present age and to posterity , as it may direct the proceedings of the courts of justice , prescribe the course of publick inquiries , and , by consequence , affect the property or life of every lord in this assembly  I hope it will be debated amongst us without the acrimony which arises from the prejudice of party , or the violence which is produced by the desire of victory , and that the controversy will be animated by no other passion than zeal for justice , and love of truth .


For my part , my lords , I have reason to believe , that many professions of my sincerity will not be necessary on this occasion , because I shall not be easily suspected of any partiality in favour of the noble lord to whom this bill immediately relates .
It is well known to your lordships how freely I have censured his conduct , and how invariably I have opposed those measures by which the nation has been so far exasperated , that the bill , now under our consideration , has been thought necessary by the commons , to pacify the general discontent , to restore the publick tranquillity , and to recover that confidence in the government , without which no happiness is to be expected , without which the best measures will always be obstructed by the people , and the justest remonstrances disregarded by the court .


But however laudable may be the end proposed by the commons , I can not , my lords , be so far dazzled by the prospect of obtaining it , as not to examine the means to which we are invited to concur , and inquire with that attention which the honour of sitting in this house has made my duty , whether they are such as have been practised by our ancestors , such as are prescribed by the law , or warranted by prudence .


The caution , my lords , with which our ancestors have always proceeded in inquiries by which life or death , property or reputation , was endangered  the certainty , or at least the high degree of probability , which they required in evidence , to make it a sufficient ground of conviction , is universally known  nor is it necessary to show their opinion by particular examples , because , being no less solicitous for the welfare of their posterity than for their own , they were careful to record their sentiments in laws and statutes , and to prescribe , with the strongest sanctions , to succeeding governments , what they had discovered by their own reflections , or been taught by their predecessors .


They considered , my lords , not only how great was the hardship of being unjustly condemned , but likewise how much a man might suffer by being falsely accused  how much he might be harassed by a prosecution , and how sensibly he might feel the disgrace of a trial .
They knew that to be charged with guilt implied some degree of reproach , and that it gave room , at least , for an inference that the known conduct of the person accused was such as made it probable that he was still more wicked than he appeared  they knew that the credulity of some might admit the charge upon evidence that was rejected by the court , and that difference of party , or private quarrels , might provoke others to propagate reports once published , even when in their own opinion they were sufficiently confuted  and that , therefore , an innocent man might languish in infamy by a groundless charge , though he should escape any legal penalty .


It has , therefore , my lords , been immemorially established in this nation , that no man can be apprehended , or called into question for any crime till there shall be proof .


First , that there is a corpus delicti , a crime really and visibly committed  thus before a process can be issued out for inquiring after a murderer , it must be apparent that a murder has been perpetrated , the dead body must be exposed to a jury , and it must appear to them that he died by violence .
It is not sufficient that a man is lost , and that it is probable that he is murdered , because no other reason of his absence can be assigned  he must be found with the marks of force upon him , or some circumstances that may make it credible , that he did not perish by accident , or his own hand .


It is required , secondly , my lords , that he who apprehends any person as guilty of the fact thus apparently committed , must suspect him to be the criminal  for he is not to take an opportunity , afforded him by the commission of an illegal act , to gratify any secret malice , or wanton curiosity  or to drag to a solemn examination , those against whom he can not support an accusation .


And , my lords , that suspicion may not ravage the reputation of Britons without control  that men may not give way to the mere suggestions of malevolence , and load the characters of those with atrocious wickedness , whom , perhaps , they have no real reason to believe more depraved than the bulk of mankind , and whose failings may have been exaggerated in their eyes by contrariety of opinion , or accidental competition , it is required in the third place , my lords , that whoever apprehends or molests another on suspicion of a crime , shall be able to give the reasons of his suspicion , and to prove them by competent evidence .


These , my lords , are three essentials which the wisdom of our ancestors has made indispensable previous to the arrest or imprisonment of the meanest Briton  it must appear , that there is a crime committed , that the person to be seized is suspected of having committed it , and that the suspicion is founded upon probability .
Requisites so reasonable in their own nature , so necessary to the protection of every man 's quiet and reputation , and , by consequence , so useful to the security and happiness of society , that , I suppose , they will need no support or vindication .
Every man is interested in the continuance of this method of proceeding , because no man is secure from suffering by the interruption or abolition of it .


Such , my lords , is the care and caution which the law directs in the first part of any criminal process , the detainment of the person supposed guilty  nor is the method of trial prescribed with less regard to the security of innocence .


It is an established maxim , that no man can be obliged to accuse himself , or to answer any questions which may have any tendency to discover what the nature of his defence requires to be concealed .
His guilt must appear either by a voluntary and unconstrained confession , which the terrours of conscience have sometimes extorted , and the notoriety of the crime has at other times produced , or by the deposition of such witnesses as the jury shall think worthy of belief .


To the credibility of any witness it is always requisite that he be disinterested , that his own cause be not involved in that of the person who stands at the bar , that he has no prospect of advancing his fortune , clearing his reputation , or securing his life .
For it is made too plain by daily examples , that interest will prevail over the virtue of most men , and that it is not safe to believe those who are strongly tempted to deceive .


There are cases , my lords , where the interest of the person offering his evidence is so apparent , that he is not even admitted to be heard  and any benefit which may possibly be proposed , is admitted as an objection to evidence , and weakens it in a measure proportionate to the distance of the prospect and the degree of profit .


Such are the rules hitherto followed in criminal proceedings , the violation of which has been always censured as cruelty and oppression , and perhaps always been repented even by those who proposed and defended it , when the commotions of party have subsided , and the heat of opposition and resentment has given way to unprejudiced reflection .


Of these rules , my lords , it is not necessary to produce any defence from the practice of distant nations , because it is sufficient in the present case , that they are established by the constitution of this country , to which every Briton has a right to appeal  for how can any man defend his conduct , if having acted under one law , he is to be tried by another ?


Let us , therefore , my lords , apply these rules to the present bill , and inquire what regard appears to have been paid to them by the commons , and how well we shall observe them by concurring in their design .


With respect to the first , by which it is required , that there be a known and manifest crime , it does not appear to have engaged the least attention in the other house  for no fact is specified in the bill , upon which a prosecution can be founded , and , therefore , to inquire after evidence is somewhat preposterous  it is nothing less than to invite men to give their opinion without a subject , and to answer without a question .


It may be urged , indeed , that there is a universal discontent over the whole nation  that the clamour against the person mentioned in the bill , has been continued for many years  that the influence of the nation is impaired in foreign countries  that our treasury is exhausted  that our liberties have been attacked , our properties invaded , and our morals corrupted  but these are yet only rumours , without proof , and without legal certainty  which may , indeed , with great propriety give occasion to an inquiry , and , perhaps , by that inquiry some facts may be ascertained which may afford sufficient reasons for farther procedure .


But such , my lords , is the form of the bill now before us , that if it should pass into a statute , it would , in my opinion , put a stop to all future inquiry , by making those incapable of giving evidence , who have had most opportunities of knowing those transactions , which have given the chief occasion of suspicion , and from whom , therefore , the most important information must naturally be expected .


The first requisite qualification of a witness , whether we consult natural equity and reason , or the common law of our own country , is disinterestedness  an indifference , with regard to all outward circumstances , about the event of the trial at which his testimony is required .
For he that is called as a witness where he is interested , is in reality giving evidence in his own cause .


But this qualification , my lords , the bill now before us manifestly takes away  for every man who shall appear against the person into whose conduct the commons are inquiring , evidently promotes , in the highest degree , his own interest by his evidence , as he may preclude all examination of his own behaviour , and secure the possession of that wealth which he has accumulated by fraud and oppression , or , perhaps , preserve that life which the justice of the nation might take away .


Nothing , my lords , is more obvious , than that this offer of indemnity may produce perjury and false accusation  nothing is more probable , than that he who is conscious of any atrocious villanies , which he can not certainly secure from discovery , will snatch this opportunity of committing one crime more , to set himself free from the dread of punishment , and blot out his own guilt for ever , by charging lord ORFORD as one of his accomplices .


It may be urged , my lords , that he who shall give false evidence , forfeits the indemnity to which the honest witness is entitled  but let us consider why this should be now , rather than in any former time , accounted a sufficient security against falsehood and perjury .
It is at all times criminal , and at all times punishable , to commit perjury  and yet it has been hitherto thought necessary , not only to deter it by subsequent penalties , but to take away all previous temptations  no man 's oath will be admitted in his own cause , though offered at the hazard of the punishment inflicted upon perjury .
To offer indemnity to invite evidence , and to deter them from false accusations by the forfeiture of it , even though we should allow to the penal clause all the efficacy which can be expected by those who proposed it , is only to set one part of the bill at variance with the other , to erect and demolish at the same time .


But it may be proved , my lords , that the reward will have more influence than the penalty  and that every man who can reason upon the condition in which he is placed by this bill , will be more incited to accuse lord ORFORD , however unjustly , by the prospect of security , than intimidated by the forfeiture incurred by perjury .


For , let us suppose , my lords , a man whose conduct exposes him to punishment , and who knows that he shall not long be able to conceal it  what can be more apparently his interest , than to contrive such an accusation as may complicate his own wickedness with some transactions of the person to whom this bill relates ?
He may , indeed , be possibly confuted , and lose the benefit offered by the state  but the loss of it will not place him in a condition more dangerous than that which he was in before  he has already deserved all the severity to which perjury will expose him , and by forging a bold and well-connected calumny , he has at least a chance of escaping .


Let us suppose , my lords , that the bill now under our consideration , assigned a pecuniary reward to any man who should appear against this person , with a clause by which he that should accuse him falsely should be dismissed without his pay  would not this appear a method of prosecution contrary to law , and reason , and justice ?
Would not every man immediately discover , that the witnesses were bribed , and therefore they would deserve no credit ?
And what is the difference between the advantage now offered and any other consideration , except that scarcely any other reward can be offered so great , and consequently so likely to influence ?


It is to be remembered , that the patrons of this bill evidently call for testimony from the abandoned and the profligate , from men whom they suppose necessarily to confess their own crimes in their depositions  and surely wretches like these ought not to be solicited to perjury by the offer of a reward .


How cruel must all impartial spectators of the publick transactions account a prosecution like this ?
What would be your lordships ' judgment , should you read , that in any distant age , or remote country , a man was condemned upon the evidence of persons publickly hired to accuse him , and who , by their own confession , were traitors to their country ?


That wickedness , my lords , should be extirpated by severity , and justice rigorously exercised upon publick offenders , is the uncontroverted interest of every country  and therefore it is not to be doubted , that in all ages the reflections of the wisest men have been employed upon the most proper methods of detecting offences  and since the scheme now proposed has never been practised , or never but by the most oppressive tyrants , in the most flagitious times , it is evident , that it has been thought inconsistent with equity , and of a tendency contrary to publick happiness .


I am very far , my lords , from desiring that any breach of national trust should escape detection , or that a publick office should afford security to bribery , extortion , or corruption .
I am far from intending to patronise the conduct of the person mentioned in the present bill .
Let the commons proceed with the utmost severity , but let them not deviate from justice .
If he has forfeited his fortune , his honours , or his life , let them by a legal process be taken from him  but let it always be considered , that he , like every other man , is to be allowed the common methods of self-defence  that he is to stand or fall by the laws of his country , and to retain the privileges of a Briton , till it shall appear that he has forfeited them by his crimes .


To censure guilt , my lords , is undoubtedly necessary , and to inquire into the conduct of men in power , incontestably just  but by the laws both of heaven and earth , the means as well as the end are prescribed , rectum recte , legitimum legitime faciendum  we must not only propose a good end in our conduct , but must attain it by that method which equity directs , and the law prescribes .


How well , my lords , the law has been observed hitherto , on this occasion , I can not but propose that your lordships should consider .
It is well known , that the commons can not claim a right to administer an oath , and therefore can only examine witnesses by simple interrogatories .
That they can not confer upon a committee the power which they have not themselves , is indubitably certain  and therefore it is evident , that they have exceeded their privileges , and proceeded in their inquiry by methods which the laws of this nation will not support .


That they can not , my lords , in their own right administer an oath , they apparently confess , by the practice of calling in , on that occasion , a justice of the peace , who , as soon as he has performed his office , is expected to retire .
This , my lords , is an evident elusion  for it is always intended , that he who gives an oath , gives it in consequence of his right to take the examination  but in this case the witness takes an oath , coram non judice , before a magistrate that has no power to interrogate him , and is interrogated by those who have no right to require his oath .


Such , my lords , is my opinion of the conduct of the committee of the house of commons , of whom I can not but conclude that they have assumed a right which the constitution of our government confers only on your lordships , as a house of senate , a court of judicature  and therefore can not think it prudent to confirm their proceedings by an approbation of this bill .


The commons may indeed imagine that the present state of affairs makes it necessary to proceed by extraordinary methods  they may believe that the nation will not be satisfied without a discovery of those frauds which have been so long practised , and the punishment of those men by whom they have so long thought themselves betrayed and oppressed  but let us consider , that clamour is not evidence , and that we ought not either to recede from justice , or from our own rights , to satisfy the expectations of the people .


To remonstrate against this invasion of our privileges , my lords , might be at this juncture improper  the dispute might , in this time of commotion and vicissitude , distract the attention of those to whom the publick affairs are committed , retard the business of the nation , and give our enemies those advantages which they can never hope from their own courage , or policy , or strength .
It may , therefore , be prudent on this occasion , only not to admit the right which they have assumed , to satisfy ourselves with retaining our privileges , without requiring any farther confirmation of them , and only defeat the invasion of them by rejecting the bill , which is , indeed , of such a kind , as can not be confirmed without hazarding not only our own rights , but those of every Briton .


For here is a species of testimony invited , which is hitherto unknown to our law , and from which it may be difficult to tell who can be secure  the witnesses are required to disclose all matters relating to the conduct of lord ORFORD , according to the best of their knowledge , remembrance , or belief !
A form of deposition , my lords , of great latitude  a man 's belief may be influenced by the report of others who may deceive him , by his observation of circumstances , either remote in themselves , or imperfectly discovered , or by his own reasonings , which must be just or fallacious according to his abilities  but which must yet have the same effect upon his belief , which they will influence , not in proportion to their real strength , but to the confidence placed in them by himself .


There is only one case , my lords , in which , by the common course of proceedings , any regard is had to mere belief  and this evidence is only accepted on that occasion , because no other can possibly be obtained .
When any claim is to be determined by written evidences , of which , in order to prove their validity , it is necessary to inquire by whom they were drawn or signed  those who are acquainted with the writing of a dead person , are admitted to deliver , upon oath , their belief that the writing ascribed to him , was or was not his  but such secondary witnesses are never called , when the person can be produced whose hand is to be proved .


There is yet another reason for which it is improper to admit such evidence as this bill has a tendency to promote .
It is well known , that in all the courts of common law , the person accused is in some degree secured from the danger of being overborne by false accusations , by the penalty which may be inflicted upon witnesses discovered to be perjured  but in the method of examination now proposed , a method unknown to the constitution , no such security can be obtained , for there is no provision made by the laws for the punishment of a man who shall give false evidence before a committee of the house of commons .


It may likewise be observed , that this bill wants one of the most essential properties of a law , perspicuity and determinate meaning  here is an indemnity promised to those who shall discover all that they know , remember , or believe .
A very extensive demand , and which may , therefore , be liable to more fallacies and evasions than can be immediately enumerated or detected .
For how can any one prove that he has a claim to the indemnity ?
He may , indeed , make some discoveries , but whether he does not conceal something , who can determine ?
May not such reserves be suspected , when his answers shall not satisfy the expectations of his interrogators ?
And may not that suspicion deprive him of the benefit of the act ?
May not a man , from want of memory , or presence of mind , omit something at his examination which he may appear afterwards to have known ?
And since no human being has the power of distinguishing exactly between faults and frailties , may not the defect of his memory be charged on him as a criminal suppression of a known fact ?
And may not he be left to suffer the consequences of his own confession ?
Will not the bill give an apparent opportunity for partiality ?
And will not life and death , liberty and imprisonment , be placed in the hands of a committee of the commons ?
May they not be easily satisfied with informations of one man , and incessantly press another to farther discoveries ?
May they not call some men , notoriously criminal , to examination , only to secure them from punishment , and set them out of the reach of justice  and extort from others such answers as may best promote their views , by declaring themselves unsatisfied with the extent of their testimony ?
And will not this be an extortion of evidence equivalent to the methods practised in the most despotick governments , and the most barbarous nations ?


It has always been the praise of this house to pay an equal regard to justice and to mercy , and to follow , without partiality , the direction of reason , and the light of truth  and how consistently with this character , which it ought to be our highest ambition to maintain , we can ratify the present bill , your lordships are this day to consider .
It is to be inquired , whether to suppose a man guilty , only because some guilt is suspected , be agreeable to justice  and whether it be rational before there is any proof of a crime , to point out the criminal .


We are to consider , my lords , whether it is not unjust to hear , against any man , an evidence who is hired to accuse him , and hired with a reward which he can not receive without confessing himself a man unworthy of belief .
It is to be inquired , whether the evidence of a man who declares only what he believes , ought to be admitted , when the nature of the crimes allows stronger proof  and whether any man ought to be examined where he can not be punished if he be found perjured .


A natural and just regard to our own rights , on the preservation of which the continuance of the constitution must depend , ought to , alarm us at the appearance of any attempt to invade them  and the necessity of known forms of justice , ought to incite us to the prevention of any innovation in the methods of prosecuting offenders .


For my own part , my lords , I can not approve either the principles or form of the bill .
I think it necessary to proceed by known precedents , when there is no immediate danger that requires extraordinary measures , of which I am far from being convinced that they are necessary on the present occasion .
I think that the certainty of a crime ought to precede the prosecution of a criminal , and I see that there is , in the present case , no crime attempted to be proved .
The commons have , in my opinion , already exceeded their privileges , and I would not willingly confirm their new claims .
For these reasons , my lords , I openly declare , that I can not agree to the bill 's being read a second time .


Lord TALBOT spoke next , to this effect : -- My lords , so high is my veneration for this great assembly , that it is never without the utmost efforts of resolution that I can prevail upon myself to give my sentiments upon any question that is the subject of debate , however strong may be my conviction , or however ardent my zeal .


But in a very particular degree do I distrust my own abilities , when I find my opinion contrary to that of the noble lord who has now spoken  and it is no common perplexity to be reduced to the difficult choice of either suppressing my thoughts , or exposing them to so disadvantageous a contrast .


Yet , since such is my present state , that I can not avoid a declaration of my thoughts on this question , without being condemned in my own breast as a deserter of my country , nor utter them without the danger of becoming contemptible in the eyes of your lordships  I will , however , follow my conscience , rather than my interest  and though I should lose any part of my little reputation , I shall find an ample recompense from the consciousness that I lost it in the discharge of my duty , on an occasion which requires from every good man the hazard of his life .


The arguments of the noble lord have had upon me an effect which they never , perhaps , produced on any part of his audience before  they have confirmed me in the contrary opinion to that which he has endeavoured to maintain .
It has been remarked , that in some encounters , not to be put to flight is to obtain the victory  and , in a controversy with the noble lord , not to be convinced by him , is to receive a sufficient proof that the cause in which he is engaged is not to be defended by wit , eloquence , or learning .


On the present question , my lords , as on all others , he has produced all that can be urged , either from the knowledge of past ages , or experience of the present  all that the scholar or the statesman can supply has been accumulated , one argument has been added to another , and all the powers of a great capacity have been employed , only to show that right and wrong can not be confounded , and that fallacy can never strike with the force of truth .


When I survey the arguments of the noble lord , disrobed of those ornaments which his imagination has so liberally bestowed upon them , I am surprised at the momentary effect which they had upon my mind , and which they could not have produced had they been clothed in the language of any other person .


For when I recollect , singly , the particular positions upon which his opinion seems to be founded , I do not find them by any means uncontrovertible  some of them seem at best uncertain , and some evidently mistaken .


That there is no apparent crime committed , and that , therefore , no legal inquiry can be made after the criminal , I can not hear without astonishment .
Is our commerce ruined , are our troops destroyed , are the morals of the people vitiated , is the senate crowded with dependants , are our fleets disarmed , our allies betrayed , and our enemies supported without a crime ?
Was there no certainty of any crime committed , when it was moved to petition his majesty to dismiss this person from his councils for ever .


It has been observed , my lords , that nothing but a sight of the dead body can warrant a pursuit after the murderer  but this is a concession sufficient for the present purpose  for if , upon the sight of a murdered person , the murderer may lawfully be inquired after , and those who are reasonably suspected detained and examined  with equal reason , my lords , may the survey of a ruined nation , a nation oppressed with burdensome taxes , devoured by the caterpillars of a standing army , sunk into contempt in every foreign court , and repining at the daily decay of its commerce , and the daily multiplication of its oppressors , incite us to an inquiry after the author of its miseries .


It is asserted , that no man ought to be called into question for any crime , who is not suspected of having committed it .
This , my lords , is a rule not only reasonable in itself , but so naturally observed , that I believe it was never yet broken  and am certain , no man will be charged with the violation of it , for accusing this person as an enemy to his country .


But he that declares his suspicion , may be called upon to discover upon what facts it is founded  nor will this part of the law produce any difficulty in the present case  for as every man in the nation suspects this person of the most enormous crimes , every man can produce sufficient arguments to justify his opinion .


On all other occasions , my lords , publick fame is allowed some weight : that any man is universally accounted wicked , will add strength to the testimony brought against him for any particular offence  and it is at least a sufficient reason for calling any man to examination , that a crime is committed , and he is generally reported to be the author of it .


That this is the state of the person into whose conduct the commons are now inquiring  that he is censured by every man in the kingdom , whose sentiments are not repressed by visible influence  that he has no friends but those who have sold their integrity for the plunder of the publick  and that all who are not enemies to their country , have , for many years , incessantly struggled to drag him down from the pinnacle of power , and expose him to that punishment which he has so long deserved , and so long defied , is evident beyond contradiction .


Let it not , therefore , be urged , my lords , that there is no certainty of a crime which is proved to the conviction of every honest mind  let it not be said that it is unreasonable to suspect this man , whom the voice of the people , a voice always to be reverenced , has so long condemned .


The method of procuring evidence against him by an act of indemnity has been represented by the noble lord as not agreeable to justice or to law : in the knowledge of the law I am far from imagining myself able to contend with him  but I think it may not be improper to observe , that a person of the highest eminence in that profession , whose long study and great abilities give his decisions an uncommon claim to authority and veneration , and who was always considered in this house with the highest regard , appears to have entertained a very different opinion .


It was declared by him , without the least restriction , that all means were lawful which tended to the discovery of truth  and , therefore , the publick may justly expect that extraordinary methods should be used upon occasions of uncommon importance .


Nor does this expedient appear to me very remote from the daily practice of promising pardon to thieves , on condition that they will make discoveries by which their confederates may be brought to justice .


If we examine only the equity of this procedure , without regard to the examples of former times , it appears to me easily defensible  for what can be more rational than to break a confederacy of wretches combined for the destruction of the happiness of mankind , by dividing their interest , and making use , for the publick good , of that regard for their own safety , which has swallowed up every other principle of action ?


It is admitted that wickedness ought to be punished , and it is universally known that punishment must be preceded by detection  any method , therefore , that promotes the discovery of crimes may be considered as advantageous to the publick .


As there is no wickedness of which the pernicious consequences are more extensive , there is none which ought more diligently to be prevented , or more severely punished , than that of those men who have dared to abuse the power which their country has put into their hands  but how they can be convicted by any other means than those which are now proposed , I confess myself unable to discover  for by a very small degree of artifice , a man invested with power may make every witness a partner of his guilt , and no man will be able to accuse him , without betraying himself .
In the present case it is evident , that the person of whose actions the bill now before us is designed to produce a more perfect discovery , has been combined with others in illegal measures , in measures which their own security obliges them to conceal , and which , therefore , the interest of the publick demands to be divulged .


That Paxton has distributed large sums for purposes which he dares not discover , we are informed by the reports of the secret committee  and I suppose every body suspects that they were distributed as rewards for services which the nation thinks not very meritorious , and I believe no man will ask what reason can be alleged for such suspicions .


But since it may be possibly suggested that Paxton expended these sums contrary to his master 's direction , or without his knowledge , it may be demanded , whether such an assertion would not be an apparent proof of a very criminal degree of negligence in a man intrusted with the care of the publick treasure ?


Thus , my lords , it appears in my opinion evident , that either he has concurred in measures which his servile agent , the mercenary tool of wickedness , is afraid to confess , or that he has stood by , negligent of his trust , and suffered the treasure of the nation to be squandered by the meanest wretches without account .


That the latter part of the accusation is undoubtedly just , the report of the commons can not but convince us .
It appears that for near eight years , Paxton was so high in confidence , that no account was demanded from him  he bestowed pensions at pleasure  he was surrounded , like his master , by his idolaters  and after the fatigue of cringing in one place , had an opportunity of purchasing the taxes of the nation , the gratification of tyranny in another .


I presume , my lords , that no man dares assert such a flagrant neglect of so important an office , to be not criminal in a very high degree  to steal in private houses that which is received in trust , is felony by the statutes of our country  and surely the wealth of the publick ought not to be less secured than that of individuals , nor ought he that connives at robbery to be treated with more lenity than the robber .


Therefore , my lords , as I can not but approve of the bill , I move that it may be read a second time  and I hope the reasons which I have offered , when joined with others , which I expect to hear from lords of a greater experience , knowledge , and capacity , will induce your lordships to be of the same opinion .


Lord HERVEY spoke next , to this effect : -- My lords , as the bill now before us is of a new kind , upon an occasion no less new , I have endeavoured to bestow upon it a proportionate degree of attention , and have considered it in all the lights in which I could place it  I have , in my imagination , connected with it all the circumstances with which it is accompanied , and all the consequences that it may produce either to the present age , or to futurity  but the longer I reflect upon it , the more firmly am I determined to oppose it  nor has deliberation any other effect , than to crowd my thoughts with new arguments against it , and to heighten dislike to detestation .


It must , my lords , immediately occur to every man , at the first mention of the method of proceeding now proposed , that it is such as nothing but extreme necessity can vindicate  that the noble person against whom it is contrived , must be a monster burdensome to the world  that his crimes must be at once publick and enormous , and that he has been already condemned by all maxims of justice , though he has had the subtilty to escape by some unforeseen defect in the forms of law .
It might be imagined , my lords , that there were the most evident marks of guilt in the conduct of the man thus censured , that he fled from the justice of his country , that he had openly suborned witnesses in his favour , or had , by some artifice certainly known , obstructed the evidence that was to have been brought against him .
It might at least be reasonably conceived , that his crimes were of such a kind as might in their own nature easily be concealed , and that , therefore , some extraordinary measures were necessary for the discovery of wickedness which lay out of the reach of common inquiry .


But , my lords , none of these circumstances can be now alleged  for there is no certainty of any crime committed , nor any appearance of consciousness or fear in the person accused , who sets his enemies at defiance in full security , and declines no legal trial of his past actions  of which it ought to be observed , that they have , by the nature of his employments , been so publick , that they may easily be examined without recourse to a new law to facilitate discoveries .


The bill , therefore , is , my lords , at least unnecessary , and an innovation not necessary ought always to be rejected , because no man can foresee all the consequences of new measures , or can know what evils they may create , or what subsequent changes they may introduce .
The alteration of one part of a system naturally requires the alteration of another .


But , my lords , that there is no necessity for this law now proposed , is not the strongest argument that may be brought against it , for there is in reality a necessity that it should be rejected .
Justice and humanity are necessarily to be supported , without which no society can subsist , nor the life or property of any man be enjoyed with security : and neither justice nor humanity can truly be said to reside , where a law like this has met with approbation .


My lords , to prosecute any man by such methods , is to overbear him by the violence of power , to take from him all the securities of innocence , and divest him of all the means of self-defence .
It is to hire against him those whose testimonies ought not to be admitted , if they were voluntarily produced , and of which , surely , nothing will be farther necessary to annihilate the validity , than to observe that they are the depositions of men who are villains by their own confession , and of whom the nation sees , that they may save their lives by a bold accusation , whether true or false .


That the bill will , indeed , be effectual to the purposes designed , that it will crowd the courts of justice with evidence , and open scenes of wickedness never discovered before , I can readily believe  for I can not imagine that any man who has exposed his life by any flagrant crime , will miss so fair an opportunity of saving it by another .
I shall expect , my lords , that villains of all denominations , who are now skulking in private retreats , who are eluding the officers of justice , or flying before the publick pursuit of the country , will secure themselves by this easy expedient  and that housebreakers , highwaymen , and pickpockets , will come up in crowds to the bar , charge the earl of ORFORD as their accomplice , and plead this bill as a security against all inquiry .


That this supposition , however wild and exaggerated it may seem , may not be thought altogether chimerical  that it may appear with how little consideration this bill has been drawn , and how easily it may be perverted to the patronage of wickedness , I will lay before your lordships such a plea as may probably be produced by it .


A man whom the consciousness of murder has for some time kept in continual terrours , may clear himself for ever , by alleging , that he was commissioned by the earl of ORFORD to engage , with any certain sum , the vote or interest of the murdered person  that he took the opportunity of a solitary place to offer him the bribe , and prevail upon him to comply with his proposals  but that finding him obstinate and perverse , filled with prejudices against a wise and just administration , and inclined to obstruct the measures of the government , he for some time expostulated with him  and being provoked by his contumelious representations of the state of affairs , he could no longer restrain the ardour of his loyalty , but thought it proper to remove from the world a man so much inclined to spread sedition among the people  and that , therefore , finding the place convenient , he suddenly rushed upon him and cut his throat .


Thus , my lords , might the murderer represent his case , perhaps , without any possibility of a legal confutation  thus might the most atrocious villanies escape censure , by the assistance of impudence and cunning .


A bill like this , my lords , is nothing less than a proscription  the head of a citizen is apparently set to sale , and evidence is hired , by which the innocent and the guilty may be destroyed with equal facility .


It is apparent , my lords , that they by whom this bill is proposed , act upon the supposition that the noble person mentioned in it , is guilty of all those crimes of which he is suspected  a supposition , my lords , which it is unjust to make , and to which neither reason , nor the laws of our country , will give countenance or support .


I , my lords , will much more equitably suppose him innocent  I will suppose that he has , throughout all the years of his administration , steadily prosecuted the best ends , by the best means  that if he has sometimes been mistaken or disappointed , it has been neither by his negligence nor ignorance , but by false intelligence , or accidents not to be foreseen  and that he has never either sacrificed his country to private interest , or procured , by any illegal methods , the assistance and support of the legislature  and I will ask your lordships , whether , if this character be just , the bill ought to be passed , and doubt not but every man 's conscience will inform him , that it ought to be rejected with the utmost indignation .


The reason , my lords , for which it ought to be rejected , is evidently this , that it may bring innocence into danger .
But , my lords , every man before his trial is to be supposed innocent , and , therefore , no man ought to be exposed to the hazards of a trial , by which virtue and wickedness are reduced to a level .
A bill like this ought to be marked out as the utmost effort of malice , as a species of cruelty never known before , and as a method of prosecution which this house has censured .


I did not , indeed , expect from those who have so long clamoured with incessant vehemence against the measures of the ministry , such an open confession of their own weakness .
Nothing , my lords , was so frequently urged , or so warmly exaggerated , as the impossibility of procuring evidence against a man in power  nothing was more confidently asserted , than that his guilt would be easily proved when his authority was at an end  and that even his own agents would readily detect him , when they were no longer dependant upon his favour .


The time , my lords , so long expected , and so ardently desired , is at length come  this noble person whom they have so long pursued with declamations , invectives , and general reproaches , has at length resigned those offices which set him above punishment or trial  he is now without any other security than that by which every other man is sheltered from oppression , the publick protection of the laws of his country  but he is yet found impregnable , he is yet able to set his enemies at defiance  and they have , therefore , now , with great sagacity , contrived a method by which he may be divested of the common privileges of a social being , and may be hunted like a wild beast , without defence , and without pity .


Where , my lords , can it be expected that malice like this will find an end ?
Is it not reasonable to imagine that if they should be gratified in this demand , and should find even this expedient baffled by the abilities which they have so often encountered without success , they would proceed to measures yet more atrocious , and punish him without evidence , whom they call to a trial without a crime .


It has been observed by the noble lord who spoke last , that there are crimes mentioned in the report of the secret committee of the house of commons , or that at least such facts are asserted in it , that an accusation may , by easy deductions , be formed from them .
The report of that committee , my lords , with whatever veneration it may be mentioned , by those whose purposes it happens to favour , or of whatever importance it may be in the other house , is here nothing but a pamphlet , not to be regarded as an evidence , or quoted as a writing of authority .
It is only an account of facts of which we know not how they were collected , and which every one may admit or reject at his own choice , till they are ascertained by proper evidence at our own bar , and which , therefore , ought not to influence our opinion in the present debate .


Nor is the bill , my lords , only founded upon principles inconsistent with the constitution of this nation , apparently tending to the introduction of a new species of oppression , but is in itself such as can not be ratified without injury to the honour of this great assembly .


In examining the bill , my lords , I think it not necessary to dwell upon the more minute and trivial defects of the orthography and expression , though they are such as might justly give occasion for suspecting that they by whom it was written , were no less strangers to our language than to our constitution .
There are errours or falsehoods which it more nearly concerns us to detect , and to which we can not give any sanction , without an evident diminution of our own authority .


It declares , my lords , that there is now an inquiry depending before the senate , an assertion evidently false , for the inquiry is only before the commons .
Whether this was inserted by mistake or design , whether it was intended to insinuate that the whole senatorial power was comprised in the house of commons , or to persuade the nation that your lordships concurred with them in this inquiry , it is not possible to determine  but since it is false in either sense , it ought not to receive our confirmation .


If we should pass the bill in its present state , we should not only declare our approbation of the measures hitherto pursued by the commons , by which it has been already proved , by the noble and learned lord who spoke first against the bill , that they have not only violated the law , but invaded the privileges of this house .
We should not only establish for ever in a committee of the house of commons , the power of examining upon oath , by an elusive and equivocatory expedient , but we should in effect vote away our own existence , give up at once all authority in the government , and grant them an unlimited power , by acknowledging them the senate , an acknowledgment which might , in a very short time , be quoted against us , and from which it would not be easy for us to extricate ourselves .


It has , indeed , been remarked , that there is a large sum of money disbursed without account , and the publick is represented as apparently injured , either by fraud or negligence  but it is not remembered that none but his majesty has a right to inquire into the distribution of the revenue appropriated to the support of his family and dignity , and the payment of his servants , and which , therefore , can not , in any degree , be called publick money , or fall under the cognizance of those whom it concerns to inspect the national accounts .
Either the civil list must be exempt from inquiries , or his majesty must be reduced to a state below that of the meanest of his subjects  he can enjoy neither freedom nor property , and must be debarred for ever from those blessings which he is incessantly labouring to secure to others .


There is , likewise , another consideration , which my regard for the honour of this assembly suggested to me , and of which I doubt not but that all your lordships will allow the importance .
The noble person who is pointed out in this bill as a publick criminal , and whom all the villains of the kingdom are invited to accuse , is invested with the same honours as ourselves , and has a son who has for many years possessed a seat amongst us  let us not , therefore , concur with the commons to load our own house with infamy , and to propagate reproach , which will at last fix upon ourselves .


Innumerable are the objections , my lords , which might yet be urged , and urged without any possibility of reply  but as I have already been heard with so much patience , I think what has been already mentioned sufficient to determine the question : and as I doubt not but the other defects and absurdities will be observed , if it be necessary , by some other lords , I shall presume only to add , that as the bill appears to me contrary to the laws of this nation , to the common justice of society , and to the general reason of mankind , as it must naturally establish a precedent of oppression , and confirm a species of authority in the other house which was either never claimed before , or always denied  as I think the most notorious and publick criminal ought not to be deprived of that method of defence which the established customs of our country allow him , and believe the person mentioned in this bill to deserve rather applauses and rewards , than censures and punishments , I think myself obliged to oppose it , and hope to find your lordships unanimous in the same opinion .


Then the duke of ARGYLE answered , in substance as follows : -- My lords , whatever may be the fate of this question , I have little hope that it will be unanimously decided , because I have reason to fear that some lords have conceived prejudices against the bill , which hinder them from discovering either its reasonableness or its necessity  and am convinced that others who approve the bill , can support their opinion by arguments from which , as they can not be confuted , they never will recede .


Those arguments which have influenced my opinion , I will lay before your lordships , and doubt not of showing that I am very far from giving way to personal malice , or the prejudices of opposition  and that I regard only the voice of reason , and the call of the nation .


Calmness and impartiality , my lords , have been , with great propriety , recommended to us by the noble lord who spoke first in this debate  and I hope he will discover by the moderation with which I shall deliver my sentiments on this occasion , how much I reverence his precepts , and how willingly I yield to his authority .


I am at least certain , that I have hitherto listened to the arguments that have been offered on either side with an attention void of prejudice  I have repressed no motions of conviction , nor abstracted my mind from any difficulty , to avoid the labour of solving it : I have been solicitous to survey every position in its whole extent , and trace it to its remotest consequences  I have assisted the arguments against the bill by favourable suppositions , and imaginary circumstances , and have endeavoured to divest my own opinion of some appendant and accidental advantages , that I might view it in a state less likely to attract regard  and yet I can not find any reason by which I could justify myself to my country or my conscience , if I should concur in rejecting this bill , or should not endeavour to promote it .
I am not unacquainted , my lords , with the difficulties that obstruct the knowledge of our own hearts , and can not deny that inclination may be sometimes mistaken for conviction  and men even wise and honest , may imagine themselves to believe what , in reality , they only wish : but this , my lords , can only happen for want of attention , or on sudden emergencies , when it is necessary to determine with little consideration , while the passions have not yet time to subside , and reason is yet struggling with the emotions of desire .


In other circumstances , my lords , I am convinced that no man imposes on himself without conniving at the fraud , without consciousness that he admits an opinion which he has not well examined , and without consulting indolence rather than reason  and , therefore , my lords , I can with confidence affirm , that I now declare my real opinion , and that if I err , I err only for want of abilities to discover the truth  and hope it will appear to your lordships , that I have been misled at least by specious arguments , and deceived by fallacious appearances , which it is no reproach not to have been able to detect .


It will , my lords , be granted , I suppose , without hesitation , that the law is consistent with itself  that it never at the same time commands and prohibits the same action  that it can not be at once violated and observed .
From thence it will inevitably follow , that where the circumstances of any transaction are such , that the principles of that law by which it is cognizable are opposite to each other , some expedients may be found by which these circumstances may be altered .
Otherwise a subtle or powerful delinquent will always find shelter in ambiguities , and the law will remain inactive , like a balance loaded equally on each side .


On the present occasion , my lords , I pronounce with the utmost confidence , as a maxim of indubitable certainty , that the publick has a claim to every man 's evidence , and that no man can plead exemption from this duty to his country .
But those whom false gratitude , or contracted notions of their own interest , or fear of being entangled in the snares of examination , prompt to disappoint the justice of the publick , urge with equal vehemence , and , indeed , with equal truth , that no man is obliged to accuse himself , and that the constitution of Britain allows no man 's evidence to be extorted from him to his own destruction .


Thus , my lords , two of the first principles of the British law , though maxims equally important , equally certain , and equally to be preserved from the least appearance of violation , are contradictory to each other , and neither can be obeyed , because neither can be infringed .


How then , my lords , is this contradiction to be reconciled , and the necessity avoided of breaking the law on one side or the other , but by the method now proposed , of setting those whose evidence is required , free from the danger which they may incur by giving it .


The end of the law is the redress of wrong , the protection of right , and the preservation of happiness  and the law is so far imperfect as it fails to produce the end for which it is instituted  and where any imperfection is discovered , it is the province of the legislature to supply it .


By the experience , my lords , of one generation after another , by the continued application of successive ages , was our law brought to its present accuracy .
As new combinations of circumstances , or unforeseen artifices of evasion , discovered to our ancestors the insufficiency of former provisions , new expedients were invented  and as wickedness improved its subtilty , the law multiplied its powers and extended its vigilance .


If I should , therefore , allow , what has been urged , that there is no precedent of a bill like this , what can be inferred from it , but that wickedness has found a shelter that was never discovered before , and which must be forced by a new method of attack ?
And what then are we required to do more than has been always done by our ancestors , on a thousand occasions of far less importance ?


I know not , my lords , whether it be possible to imagine an emergence that can more evidently require the interposition of the legislative power , than this which is now proposed to your consideration .
The nation has been betrayed in peace , and disgraced in war  the constitution has been openly invaded , the votes of the commons set publickly to sale , the treasures of the publick have been squandered to purchase security to those by whom it was oppressed , the people are exasperated to madness , the commons have begun the inquiry that has been for more than twenty years demanded and eluded , and justice is on a sudden insuperably retarded by the deficiency of the law .


Surely , my lords , this is an occasion that may justify the exertion of unusual powers , and yet nothing either new or unusual is required  for the bill now proposed may be supported both by precedents of occasional laws , and parallel statutes of lasting obligation .


When frauds have been committed by the agents of trading companies , bills of indemnity to those by whom any discoveries should be made , have been proposed and passed without any of those dreadful consequences which some noble lords have foreseen in this .
I have never heard that any man was so stupid as to mistake such a bill for a general act of grace , or that the confession of any crimes was procured by it , except of those which it was intended to detect  I have never been informed , that any murderer was blessed with the acuteness of the noble lord , or thought of flying to such an act as to a common shelter for villany .
Such suppositions , my lords , can be intended only to prolong a controversy and weary an opponent  nor can such trifling exaggerations contribute to any other end , than of discovering the fertility of imagination , and the exuberance of eloquence .


For my part , my lords , I think passion and negligence equally culpable in a debate like this  and can not forbear to recommend seriousness and attention , with the same zeal with which moderation and impartiality have already been inculcated .
He that entirely disregards the question in debate , who thinks it too trivial for a serious discussion , and speaks upon it with the same superficial gaiety with which he would relate the change of a fashion , or the incidents of a ball , is not very likely , either to discover or propagate the truth  and is less to be pardoned , than he who is betrayed by passion into absurdities , as it is less criminal to injure our country by zeal than by contempt .


That bills , without any essential difference from that which is now before us , have been passed in favour of private companies , is indisputably certain  it is certain that they never produced any other effect , than such as were expected from them by those who promoted them .
It is evident , that the welfare of the nation is more worthy of our regard than any separate company  that the whole , of more importance than a part  and therefore , the same measures may be now used with far greater justice , and with equal probability of success .


The necessity of the law now proposed , my lords , can not more plainly appear , than by reflecting on the absurdity of the pleas made use of for refusing it , which , considered in the whole , contain only this assertion , that the security of one man is to be preferred to justice , to truth , to publick felicity  that a precedent is rather to be established , which will for ever shelter every future minister from the laws of our country  and that all our miseries are rather to be borne in silence , or lamented in impotence , than the man , whom the whole nation agrees to accuse as the author of them , should be exposed to the hazard of a trial , even before those whom every tie of interest and long-continued affection has united to him .


It is , indeed , objected , that by passing this bill , we shall transfer the authority of trying him to the other house  that we shall give up our privileges for ever , erect a new court of judicature , and overturn the constitution .


I have long observed , my lords , how vain it is to argue against those whose resolutions are determined by extrinsick motives , and have been long acquainted with the art of disguising obstinacy , by an appearance of reasons that have no weight , even in the opinion of him by whom they are offered , and of raising clouds of objections , which , by the first reply , will certainly be dissipated , but which , at least , fill the mouth for a time , and preserve the disputant from the reproach of adhering to an opinion , in vindication of which he had nothing to say .


Of this kind is the objection which I am now to remove , though I remove it only to make way for another , for those can never be silenced who can satisfy themselves with arguments like this  however , those that offer it expect it should be answered , and if it should be passed over in the debate , will boast of its irrefragability , and imagine that they have gained the victory by the superiority of their abilities , rather than of their numbers .


That we shall , by passing this bill , give the commons a power which they want at present , is unquestionably evident  but we shall only retrieve that which they were never known to want before , the power of producing evidence  evidence which we , my lords , must hear , and of whose testimonies we shall reserve the judgment to ourselves .
The commons will only act as prosecutors , a character in which they were never conceived to encroach upon our right .
The man whose conduct is the subject of inquiry , must stand his trial at our bar  nor has the bill any other tendency , than to enable the commons to bring him to it .


What can be alleged against this design I know not  because I can discover no objections which do not imply guilt , and guilt we are not yet at liberty to suppose .
I am so far from pressing this bill from any motives of personal malevolence , that I am only doing , in the case of the minister , what I should ardently desire to be done in my own , and what no man would wish to obstruct , who was supported by a consciousness of integrity , and stimulated by that honest sense of reputation which I have always found the concomitant of innocence .


I hope I shall be readily believed by your lordships , when I assert , once more , that I should not only forbear all opposition to a bill intended to produce a scrutiny into my conduct , but that I should promote it with all my interest , and solicit all my friends to expedite and support it  for there was once a time , my lords , in which my behaviour was brought to the test , a time when no expedient was forgotten by which I might be oppressed , nor any method untried to procure accusations against me .


Whether the present case in every circumstance will stand exactly parallel to mine , I am very far from presuming to determine .
I had served my country with industry , fidelity , and success , and had received the illustrious testimony of my conduct , the publick thanks of this house .
I was conscious of no crime , nor had gratified , in my services , any other passion than my zeal for the publick .
I saw myself ignominiously discarded , and attacked by every method of calumny and reproach .
Nor was the malice of my enemies satisfied with destroying my reputation without impairing my fortune : for this purpose a prosecution was projected , a wretch was found out who engaged to accuse me , and received his pardon for no other purpose  nor did I make any opposition to it in this house , though I knew the intent with which it was procured , and was informed that part of my estate was allotted him to harden his heart , and strengthen his assertions .


This , my lords , is surely a precedent which I have a right to quote , and which will vindicate me to your lordships from the imputation of partiality and malignity  since it is apparent , that I do only in the case of another , what I willingly submitted to , when an inquiry was making into my conduct .


But , my lords , this is far from being the only precedent which may be pleaded in favour of this bill  a bill which , in reality , concurs with the general and regular practice of the established law , as will appear to every one that compares it with the eighth section of the act for preventing bribery  in which it is established as a perpetual law , that he who , having taken a bribe , shall , within twelve months , inform against him that gave it , shall be received as an evidence , and be indemnified from all the consequences of his discovery .


To these arguments of reason and precedent , I will add one of a more prevalent kind , drawn from motives of interest , which surely would direct our ministers to favour the inquiry , and promote every expedient that might produce a complete discussion of the publick affairs  since they would show , that they are not afraid of the most rigorous scrutiny , and are above any fears that the precedent which they are now establishing may revolve upon themselves .


To elude the ratification of this bill , it was at first urged that there was no proof of any crime  and when it was shown , that there was an apparent misapplication of the publick money , it became necessary to determine upon a more hardy assertion , and to silence malicious reasoners , by showing them how little their arguments would be regarded .
It then was denied , with a spirit worthy of the cause in which it was exerted , that the civil list was publick money .


Disputants like these , my lords , are not born to be confuted  it would be to little purpose that any man should ask , whether the money allotted for the civil list was not granted by the publick , and whether publick grants did not produce publick money  it would be without any effect , that the uses for which that grant is made should be enumerated , and the misapplication of it openly proved  a distinction , or at least a negative , would be always at hand , and obstinacy and interest would turn argument aside .


Upon what principles , my lords , we can now call out for a proof of crimes , and proceed in the debate as if no just reason of suspicion had appeared , I am not able to conjecture  here is , in my opinion , if not demonstrative proof , yet the strongest presumption of one of the greatest crimes of which any man can be guilty , the propagation of wickedness , of the most atrocious breach of trust which can be charged upon a British minister , a deliberate traffick for the liberties of his country .


Of these enormous villanies , however difficult it may now seem to disengage him from them , I hope we shall see reason to acquit him at the bar of this house , at which , if he be innocent , he ought to be desirous of appearing  nor do his friends consult his honour , by endeavouring to withhold him from it  if they , indeed , believe him guilty , they may then easily justify their conduct to him , but the world will , perhaps , require a more publick vindication .


These , my lords , are the arguments which have influenced me hitherto to approve the bill now before us , and which will continue their prevalence , till I shall hear them confuted  and , surely , if they are not altogether unanswerable , they are surely of so much importance , that the bill for which they have been produced , must be allowed to deserve , at least , a deliberate examination , and may very justly be referred to a committee , in which ambiguities may be removed , and inadvertencies corrected .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke next , to the following purpose : -- My lords , this bill is , in my opinion , so far from deserving approbation , that I am in doubt whether I should retard the determination of the house , by laying before you the reasons which influence me in this debate  nor , indeed , could I prevail upon myself to enter into a formal discussion of a question , on which I should have imagined that all mankind would have been of one opinion , did not my reverence of the abilities of those noble lords who have spoken in defence of the bill , incline me , even against the conviction of my own reason , to suspect that arguments may be offered in its favour , which I have not yet been able to discover  and that those which have been produced , however inconclusive they have seemed , will operate more powerfully when they are more fully displayed , and better understood .


For this reason I shall lay before your lordships the objections which arose in my mind when the bill was first laid before us , and which have rather been strengthened than invalidated by the subsequent debate .


It appears , my lords , evident to me , that every man has a right to be tried by the known laws of his country  that no man can be justly punished by a law made after the commission of a fact , because he then suffers by a law , against which he never transgressed  nor is any man to be prosecuted by methods invented only to facilitate his condemnation , because he ought to be acquitted , however guilty he may be supposed , whom the established rules of justice can not convict .
The law , my lords , is the measure of political , as conscience of moral right  and he that breaks no law , may indeed be criminal , but is not punishable .
The law likewise prescribes the method of prosecuting guilt  and as we , by omitting any crime in our laws , disable ourselves from punishing it , however publick or flagrant , so by regulating the process in our courts of justice , we give security to that guilt , which by that process can not be detected .


The truth of this assertion , my lords , however paradoxical it may perhaps appear , will become evident , if we suppose a man brought to the bar whose guilt was unquestionable , though it could not be legally proved , because all those were dead who might have appeared against him .
It is certain that his good fortune would give him no claim to pardon , and yet he could not be convicted , unless we suppose him weak enough to accuse himself .
In this case , my lords , it is not impossible , that some might be prompted by their zeal to propose , that the foreign methods of justice might be introduced , and the rack employed to extort , from his own mouth , a confession of those crimes of which every one believed him guilty .


With what horrour , my lords , such a proposal would be heard , how loudly it would be censured , and how universally rejected , I need not say  but must observe , that , in my opinion , the detestation would arise principally from a sense of the injustice of exposing any man to peculiar hardships , and distinguishing him to his disadvantage from the rest of the community .


It will , my lords , not be easy to prove , that it is less agreeable to justice to oblige a man to accuse himself , than to make use of extraordinary methods of procuring evidence against him  because the barriers of security which the law has fixed are equally broken in either case , and the accused is exposed to dangers , from which he had reason to believe himself sheltered by the constitution of his country .


This argument , my lords , I have mentioned , without endeavouring to evince the innocence of the person whom this bill immediately regards  because the intent of it is to show , that no man is to be deprived of the common benefits of the constitution , and that the guilty have a right to all the advantages which the law allows them .
For guilt is never to be supposed till it is proved , and it is therefore never to be proved by new methods , merely because it is supposed .


That the method of procuring evidence now proposed , is new , my lords , I think it no temerity to conclude  because the noble lords who have endeavoured to defend it , have produced no instance of a parallel practice , and their knowledge and acuteness is such , that they can only have failed to discover them , because they are indeed nowhere to be found .


In the case of bribery , my lords , the person accused has the privilege , if he be innocent , of prosecuting his accuser for perjury , and is therefore in less danger of being harassed by a false indictment .
But , my lords , this is not the only difference between the two cases  for he that discovers a bribe received by himself , has no motives of interest to prompt his evidence  he is only secured from suffering by his own discovery , and might have been equally safe by silence and secrecy  since the law supposes the crime out of the reach of detection , otherwise than by the confession of the criminal .


But far different , my lords , are the circumstances of those who are now invited to throng the courts of justice , and stun us with depositions and discoveries .
They are men supposed criminal by the indemnity which is offered them  and by the nature of their crimes it is made at least probable , that they are in daily hazard of discovery and punishment  from which they are summoned to set themselves free for ever , by accusing a man of whom it has not been yet proved that he can legally be called to a trial .


Thus , my lords , in the law which the noble duke has mentioned as a precedent for this bill , the accuser is only placed in a kind of equilibrium , equally secure from punishment , by silence or by information , in hope that the love of truth and justice will turn the balance  in the bill now before us the witness is in continual danger by withholding his evidence , and is restored to perfect safety by becoming an accuser , and from making discoveries , whether true or false , has every thing to hope and nothing to fear .


The necessity of punishing wickedness has been urged with great strength  it has been unanswerably shown , by the advocates for this bill , that vindictive justice is of the highest importance to the happiness of the publick , and that those who may be injured with impunity , are , in reality , denied the benefits of society , and can be said to live in the state of uncivilized nature , in which the strong must prey upon the weak .


This , my lords , has been urged with all the appearance of conviction and sincerity , and yet has been urged by those who are providing a shelter for the most enormous villanies , and enabling men who have violated every precept of law and virtue , to bid defiance to justice , and to sit at ease in the enjoyment of their acquisitions .


And what , my lords , is the condition , upon which wickedness is to be set free from terrour , upon which national justice is to be disarmed , and the betrayers of publick counsels , or the plunderers of publick treasure , qualified for new trusts , and set on a level with untainted fidelity ?
A condition , my lords , which wretches like these will very readily accept , the easy terms of information and of perjury .
They are required only to give evidence against a man marked out for destruction , and the guilt of partaking in his crimes is to be effaced by the merit of concurring in his ruin .


It has , indeed , been a method of detection , frequently employed against housebreakers and highwaymen , to proclaim a pardon for him that shall convict his accomplices  but surely , my lords , this practice will not , in the present question , be mentioned as a precedent .
Surely it will not be thought equitable to level with felons , and with thieves , a person distinguished by his rank , his employments , his abilities , and his services  a person , whose loyalty to his sovereign has never been called in question , and whose fidelity to his country has at least never been disproved .


These are measures , my lords , which I hope your lordships will never concur to promote  measures not supported either by law or justice , or enforced by any exigence of affairs , but dictated by persecution , malice , and revenge  measures by which the guilty and the innocent may be destroyed with equal facility , and which must , therefore , tend to encourage wickedness as they destroy the security of virtue .


Lord CARTERET then rose , and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , I have so long honoured the abilities , and so often concurred with the opinion of the noble lord who began the debate , that I can not , without unusual concern , rise up now to speak in opposition to him  nor could any other principle support me under the apparent disadvantage of a contest so unequal , but the consciousness of upright intentions , and the concurrence of the whole nation .


I can not but consider myself , on this occasion , my lords , as the advocate of the people of Britain , who , after continued oppressions , losses , and indignities , after having been plundered and ridiculed , harassed and insulted for complaining , have at length flattered themselves that they should have an opportunity of appealing to our bar for justice , and of securing themselves from future injuries , by the punishment of those that had so long triumphed in their guilt , proclaimed their defiance of justice , and declared that the laws were made only for their security .


The expectations of the people have been frustrated by the unexpected obstinacy of the agents of wickedness , by a plea that was never made use of for the same purpose before , against which the known laws of the nation have provided no remedy , and which your lordships are , therefore , now called upon to overthrow .


That the nation calls loudly for an inquiry , that the misapplication of the publick treasure is universally suspected , and that the person mentioned in the bill is believed to be the chief author of that misapplication  that at least those who have squandered it , have acted by his authority , and been admitted to trust by his recommendation , and that he is , therefore , accountable to the publick for their conduct , I shall suppose , can not be denied .


The nation , my lords , has a right to be gratified in their demands of an inquiry , whatever be the foundation of their suspicions  since it is manifest that it can produce no other effects than those of giving new lustre to innocence , and quieting the clamours of the people , if it should be found that the government has been administered with honesty and ability  and it is not less evident that , if the general opinion is well grounded , if our interest has been betrayed , and that money employed only to corrupt the nation which was raised for the defence of it , the severest punishment ought to be inflicted , that all future ministers may be deterred from the same crimes by exemplary vengeance .


Thus , my lords , an inquiry appears , upon every supposition , useful and necessary  but I can not comprehend how it can be prosecuted by any other method , than that of proposing an indemnity to those who shall make discoveries .
Every wicked measure , my lords , must involve in guilt all who are engaged in it  and how easily it may be concealed from every other person , may be shown by an example of a crime , which no man will deny to have sometimes existed , and which , in the opinion of most , is not very uncommon in this age .


It will be allowed , at least , that on some occasions , when a favourite begins to totter , when strong objections are raised against the continuance of a standing army , when a convention requires the ratification of the legislature , or some fatal address is proposed to be presented to the crown , a pecuniary reward may sometimes be offered , and though that , indeed , be a supposition more difficult to be admitted , sometimes , however rarely , accepted .


In this case , my lords , none but he that gives , and he that receives the bribe can be conscious of it  at most , we can only suppose an intervening agent to have any knowledge of it  and if even he is admitted to the secret , so as to be able to make a legal discovery , there must be some defect of cunning in the principals .
Let us consider from which of these any discovery can be probably expected , or what reason can be alleged , for which either should expose himself to punishment for the sake of ruining his associates .


It is , therefore , my lords , plain , from this instance , that without the confession of some guilty person , no discovery can be made of those crimes which are most detrimental to our happiness , and most dangerous to our liberties .
It is apparent that no man will discover his own guilt  while there remains any danger of suffering by his confession , it is certain that such crimes will be committed , if they are not discouraged by the fear of punishment , and it can not , therefore , be denied that a proclamation of indemnity is necessary to their detection .


This , my lords , is not , as it has been alleged , a method unknown to our constitution , as every man that reads the common papers will easily discover .
I doubt if there has been , for many years , a single month in which some reward , as well as indemnity , has not been promised to any man , who , having been engaged in a robbery , would discover his confederates  and surely a method that is daily practised for the security of private property , may be very rationally and justly adopted by the legislature for the preservation of the happiness and the property of the publick .


The punishment of wickedness , my lords , is undoubtedly one of the essential parts of good government , and , in reality , the chief purpose for which society is instituted  for how will that society in which any individual may be plundered , enslaved , and murdered , without redress and without punishment , differ from the state of corrupt nature , in which the strongest must be absolute , and right and power always the same ?


That constitution , therefore , which has not provided for the punishment , and previously for the discovery of guilt , is so far in a state of imperfection , and requires to be strengthened by new provisions .
This , my lords , is far from being our state , for we have in our hands a method of detecting the most powerful criminals , a method in itself agreeable to reason , recommended by the practice of our predecessors , and now approved , once more , by the sanction of one of the branches of the legislature .


The objections which have , on this occasion , been made against it , are such as no law can escape , and which , therefore , can have no weight  and it is no small confirmation of the expediency of it , that they by whom it has been opposed have not been able to attack it with stronger reasons , from which , if we consider their abilities , we shall be convinced , that nothing has secured it but the power of truth .


It is inquired , by the noble lord , how we shall distinguish true from false evidence  to which it may be very readily answered , that we shall distinguish them by the same means as on any other occasion , by comparing the allegations , and considering how every witness agrees with others and with himself , how far his assertions are in themselves probable , how they are confirmed or weakened by known circumstances , and how far they are invalidated by the contrary evidence .


We shall , my lords , if we add our sanction to this bill , discover when any man 's accusation is prompted by his interest , as we might know whether it was dictated by his malice .


It has been asked also , how any man can ascertain his claim to the indemnity ?
To which it may be easily replied , that by giving his evidence he acquires a right , till that evidence shall be proved to be false .


The noble lord who spoke some time ago , and whose abilities and qualities are such , that I can not but esteem and admire him , even when conviction obliges me to oppose him , has proposed a case in which he seems to imagine that a murderer might secure himself from punishment , by connecting his crime with some transaction in which the earl of ORFORD should be interested .
This case , my lords , is sufficiently improbable , nor is it easy to mention any method of trial in which some inconvenience may not be produced , in the indefinite complications of circumstances , and unforeseen relations of events .
It is known to have happened once , and can not be known not to have happened often , that a person accused of murder , was tried by a jury of which the real murderer was one .
Will not this then be an argument against the great privilege of the natives of this empire , a trial by their equals ?


But , my lords , I am of opinion that the murderer would not be indemnified by this bill , since he did not commit the crime by the direction of the person whom he is supposed to accuse  nor would it have any necessary connexion with his conduct , but might be suppressed in the accusation , without any diminution of the force of the evidence .
A man will not be suffered to introduce his accusation with an account of all the villanies of his whole life , but will be required to confine his testimony to the affair upon which he is examined .


The committee , my lords , will distinguish between the crimes perpetrated by the direction of the earl of ORFORD , and those of another kind .
And should an enormous criminal give such evidence , as the noble lord was pleased to suppose , he may be indemnified for the bribery , but will be hanged for the murder , notwithstanding any thing in this bill to the contrary .


It has been insisted on by the noble lords , who have spoke against the bill , that no crime is proved , and , therefore , there is no foundation for it .
But , my lords , I have always thought that the profusion of the publick money was a crime , and there is evidently a very large sum expended , of which no account has been given  and , what more nearly relates to the present question , of which no account has ever been demanded .


On this occasion , my lords , an assertion has been alleged , which no personal regard shall ever prevail upon me to hear without disputing it , since I think it is of the most dangerous tendency , and unsupported by reason or by law .
It is alleged , my lords , that the civil list is not to be considered as publick money , and that the nation has , therefore , no claim to inquire how it is distributed  that it is given to support the dignity of the crown , and that only his majesty can ask the reason of any failures in the accounts of it .


I have , on the contrary , my lords , hitherto understood , that all was publick money which was given by the publick .
The present condition of the crown is very different from that of our ancient monarchs , who supported their dignity by their own estates .
I admit , my lords , that they might at pleasure contract or enlarge their expenses , mortgage or alienate their lands , or bestow presents and pensions without control .


It is , indeed , expressed in the act , that the grants of the civil list are without account , by which I have hitherto understood only that the sum total is exempt from account  not that the ministers have a right to employ the civil list to such purposes as they shall think most conducive to their private views .
For if it should be granted , not only that the nation has no right to know how the whole is expended , which is the utmost that can be allowed , or to direct the application of any part of it , which is very disputable , yet it certainly has a claim to direct in what manner it shall not be applied , and to provide that boroughs are not corrupted under pretence of promoting the dignity of the crown .


The corruption of boroughs , my lords , is one of the greatest crimes of which any man under our constitution is capable  it is to corrupt , at once , the fountain and the stream of government , to poison the whole nation at once , and to make the people wicked , that they may infect the house of commons with wicked representatives .


Such , my lords , are the crimes , the suspicion of which incited the commons to a publick inquiry , in which they have been able to proceed so far , as to prove that the publick discontent was not without cause , and that such arts had been practised , as it is absolutely necessary , to the publick security , to detect and punish .


They , therefore , pursued their examination with a degree of ardour proportioned to the importance of the danger in which every man is involved by the violation of the fundamental laws of the constitution  but , they found themselves obstructed by the subtilty of some who confessed only that they were guilty , and determined to be faithful to their accomplices and themselves .


A farther inquiry , my lords , was , by this unforeseen evasion , made impossible  the ultimate and principal agent is sheltered from the law by his guard of mercenaries , wretches who are contented to be infamous , if they can continue to be rich , and value themselves on their adherence to their master , while they are conspiring to ruin their country .


The nation , my lords , in the mean time , justly applies for redress to the power of the legislature , and to its wisdom for methods of procuring it by law .
The commons have complied with their importunities , and propose to your lordships the bill before you , a bill for making a publick inquiry possible , and for bringing a minister within reach of the law .


On this occasion , my lords , we are upbraided with our own declarations , that the person mentioned in this bill would quickly find accusers , when he should be divested of his authority .
Behold him now , say his advocates , reduced from his envied eminence , and placed on a level with his fellow-subjects !
Behold him no longer the distributer of employments , or the disburser of the publick treasure !
see him divested of all security , but that of innocence , and yet no accusations are produced !


This , my lords , is a topick so fruitful of panegyrick , and so happily adapted to the imagination of a person long used to celebrate the wisdom and integrity of ministers , that , were not the present question of too great importance to admit of false concessions , I should suffer it to remain without controversy .


But , my lords , this is no time for criminal indulgence  and , therefore , I shall annihilate this short-lived triumph by observing , that to be out of place , is not necessarily to be out of power  a minister may retain his influence , who has resigned his employment  he may still retain the favour of his prince , and possess him with a false opinion , that he can only secure his authority by protecting him  or , what there is equal reason to suspect , his successours may be afraid of concurring in a law which may hereafter be revived against themselves .


It may be urged farther , my lords , that he can not with great propriety be said to have no power , who sees the legislature crowded with men that are indebted to his favour for their rank and their fortunes .


Such a man may bid defiance to inquiry , with confidence produced by security very different from that of innocence  he may depend upon the secrecy of those whom he has , perhaps , chosen for no other virtue  he may know that common danger will unite them to him , and that they can not abandon him without exposing themselves to the same censures .


These securities , my lords , the fortifications of the last retreat of wickedness , remain now to be broken , and the nation expects its fate from our determinations , which will either secure the liberties of our posterity from violation , by showing that no degree of power can shelter those who shall invade them , or that our constitution is arrived at this period , and that all struggles for its continuance will be vain .


Let us not , my lords , combine with the publick enemies , let us not give the nation reason to believe that this house is infected with the contagion of venality , that our honour is become an empty name , and that the examples of our ancestors have no other effect upon us than to raise the price of perfidy , and enable us to sell our country at a higher rate .


Let us remember , my lords , that power is supported by opinion , and that the reverence of the publick can not be preserved but by rigid justice and active beneficence .


For this reason , I am far from granting that we ought to be cautious of charging those with crimes who have the honour of a seat amongst us .
In my opinion , my lords , we ought to be watchful against the least suspicion of wickedness in our own body , we ought to eject pollution from our walls , and preserve that power for which some appear so anxious , by keeping our reputation pure and untainted .


It is , therefore , to little purpose objected , that there is no corpus delicti  for even , though it were true , yet while there is a corpus suspicionis , then inquiry ought to be made for our own honour , nor can either law or reason be pleaded against it .


I can not , therefore , doubt , that your lordships will endeavour to do justice  that you will facilitate the production of oral evidence , lest all written proofs should be destroyed  that you will not despise the united petition of the whole people , of which I dread the consequence  nor reject the only expedient by which their fears may be dissipated , and their happiness secured .


Lord HARDWICKE spoke next , in the following manner : -- My lords , after having , with an intention uninterrupted by any foreign considerations , and a mind intent only on the discovery of truth , examined every argument which has been urged on either side , I think it my duty to declare , that I have yet discovered no reason , which , in my opinion , ought to prevail upon us to ratify the bill that is now before us .


The noble lords who have defended it , appear to reason more upon maxims of policy , than rules of law , or principles of justice  and seem to imagine , that if they can prove it to be expedient , it is not necessary to show that it is equitable .


How far , my lords , they have succeeded in that argument which they have most laboured , I think it not necessary to examine , because I have hitherto accounted it an incontestable maxim , that whenever interest and virtue are in competition , virtue is always to be preferred .


The noble lord who spoke first in this debate , has proved the unreasonableness and illegality of the methods proposed in this bill , beyond the possibility of confutation  he has shown that they are inconsistent with the law , and-that the law is founded upon reason : he has proved , that the bill supposes a criminal previous to the crime , summons the man to a trial , and then inquires for what offence .


Nor has he , my lords , confined himself to a detection of the original defect , the uncertainty of any crime committed , but has proceeded to prove , that upon whatever supposition we proceed , the bill is unequitable , and of no other tendency than to multiply grievances , and establish a precedent of oppression .


For this purpose he has shown , that no evidence can be procured by this till , because all those who shall , upon the encouragement proposed in it , offer information , must be considered as hired witnesses , to whom no credit can be given , and who , therefore , ought not to be heard .


His lordship also proved , that we can not pass this bill without diminishing our right , bestowing new powers upon the commons , confirming some of their claims which are most dubious , nor , by consequence , without violating the constitution .


To all these arguments , arguments drawn from the most important considerations , enforced by the strongest reasoning , and explained with the utmost perspicuity , what has been replied ?
How have any of his assertions been invalidated , or any of his reasons eluded ?
How has it been shown that there is any foundation for a criminal charge , that witnesses thus procured ought to be heard , or that our rights would not be made disputable by confirming the proceedings of the commons ?


It has been answered by a noble lord , that though there is not corpus delicti , there is corpus suspicionis .
What may be the force of this argument , I can not say , because I am not ashamed to own , that I do not understand the meaning of the words .
I very well understand what is meant by corpus delicti , and so does every other lord  it is universally known to mean the body of an offence  but as to the words corpus suspicionis , I do not comprehend what they mean : it is an expression , indeed , which I never before heard , and can signify , in my apprehension , nothing more than the body of a shadow , the substance of something which is itself nothing .


Such , my lords , is the principle of this bill , by the confession of its warmest and ablest advocates  it is a bill for summoning a person to a trial , against whom no crime is alleged , and against whom no witness will appear without a bribe .


For that those who should appear in consequence of this bill to offer their evidence , ought to be considered as bribed , will , surely , need no proof to those who consider , that bribes are not confined to money , and that every man who promotes his own interest by his deposition , is swearing , not for truth and justice , but for himself .


It may be urged , and it is , in my opinion , all that the most fruitful imagination can suggest in favour of this bill , that they are not required to accuse the earl of ORFORD , but to give in their evidence concerning his conduct , whether in his favour , or against him .


But this argument , my lords , however specious it may seem , will vanish of itself , if the bill be diligently considered , which is only to confer indemnity on those , who in the course of their evidence shall discover any of their own crimes  on those whose testimony shall tend to fix some charge of wickedness on the earl of ORFORD  for it can not easily be imagined how those who appear in his favour , should be under a necessity of revealing any actions that require an indemnity .


Thus , my lords , it appears that the bill can produce no other effect than that of multiplying accusations , since it offers rewards only to those who are supposed to have been engaged in unjustifiable practices  and to procure witnesses by this method , is equally unjust as to propose a publick prize to be obtained by swearing against any of your lordships .


If witnesses are to be purchased , we ought , at least , to offer an equal price on each side , that though they may be induced by the reward to offer their depositions , they may not be tempted to accuse rather than to justify .


Should any private man , my lords , offer a reward to any that would give evidence against another , without specifying the crime of which he is accused , doubtless he would be considered by the laws of this nation , as a violator of the rights of society , an open slanderer , and a disturber of mankind  and would immediately , by an indictment or information , be obliged to make satisfaction to the community which he had offended , or to the person whom he had injured .


It has , my lords , I own , been asserted by the noble duke , that the publick has a right to every man 's evidence , a maxim which in its proper sense can not be denied .
For it is undoubtedly true , that the publick has a right to all the assistance of every individual  but it is , my lords , upon such terms as have been established for the general advantage of all  on such terms as the majority of each society has prescribed .
But , my lords , the majority of a society , which is the true definition of the publick , are equally obliged with the smaller number , or with individuals , to the observation of justice , and can not , therefore , prescribe to different individuals different conditions .
They can not decree that treatment to be just with regard to one which they allow to be cruel with respect to another .
The claims of the publick are founded , first upon right , which is invariable  and next upon the law , which , though mutable in its own nature , is , however , to be so far fixed , as that every man may know his own condition , his own property , and his own privileges , or it ceases in effect to be law , it ceases to be the rule of government , or the measure of conduct .


In the present case , my lords , the publick has not a right to hire evidence , because the publick has hitherto subsisted upon this condition , among others , that no man shall swear in his own cause .
The publick has not a right to require from any man that he should betray himself , because every man may plead that he is exempted from that demand by the publick faith .


Thus , my lords , the right of the publick is only that right which the publick has established by law , and confirmed by continual claims  nor is the claim of the publick from individuals to be extended beyond its known bounds , except in times of general distress , where a few must necessarily suffer for the preservation of the rest .


This necessity is , indeed , now urged  but surely it ought to be shown , that the present circumstances of affairs differ from those of any former age , before it can with any propriety he asserted , that measures are now necessary , which no other distresses , however urgent , or provocations , however flagrant , have hitherto produced .
It ought to be proved , that wickedness had discovered some new shelter from justice , before new engines are invented to force it from its retreat , and new powers applied to drag it out to punishment .


The nation has subsisted , my lords , so many centuries  has often recovered from the lingering disease of inward corruption , and repelled the shocks of outward violence  it has often been endangered by corrupt counsels , and wicked machinations , and surmounted them by the force of its established laws , without the assistance of temporary expedients  at least without expedients like this , which neither law nor justice can support , and which would in itself be a more atrocious grievance than those , if they were real , which it is intended to punish , and might produce far greater evils than those which are imputed to him , against whom it is projected .


It has , indeed , my lords , been mentioned by a noble lord , in much softer language , as a method only of making an inquiry possible .
The possibility of an inquiry , my lords , is a very remote and inoffensive idea  but names will not change the nature of the things to which they are applied .
The bill is , in my opinion , calculated to make a defence impossible , to deprive innocence of its guard , and to let loose oppression and perjury upon the world .
It is a bill to dazzle the wicked with a prospect of security , and to incite them to purchase an indemnity for one crime , by the perpetration of another .
It is a bill to confound the notions of right and wrong , to violate the essence of our constitution , and to leave us without any certain security for our properties , or rule for our actions .


Nor are the particular parts less defective than the general foundation  for it is full of ambiguous promises , vague ideas , and indeterminate expressions , of which some have been already particularized by the noble lords that have spoken on this occasion , whose observations I shall not repeat , nor endeavour to improve  but can not forbear proposing to the advocates for the bill one sentence , that it may be explained by them , and that at least we may not pass what we do not understand .


In the inquiry into the conduct of the earl of ORFORD , every man , as we have already seen , is invited to bring his evidence , and to procure an indemnity , by answering such questions as shall be asked , touching or concerning the said inquiry , or relative thereto .
What is to be understood by this last sentence , I would willingly be informed  I would hear how far the relation to the inquiry is designed to be extended , with what other inquiries it is to be complicated , and where the chain of interrogatories is to have an end .


When an evidence appears before the committee , how can he be certain that the questions asked are relative to the inquiry ?
How can he be certain that they are such as he may procure an indemnity by resolving ?
Or whether they are not unconnected with the principal question , and therefore insidious and dangerous ?
And to what power must he appeal , if he should be prosecuted afterwards upon his own confession , on pretence that it was not relative to the inquiry ?


Expressions like these , my lords , if they are not the effects of malicious hurry , and negligent animosity , must be intended to vest the committee with absolute authority , with the award of life and death , by leaving to them the liberty to explain the statute at their own pleasure , to contract or enlarge the relation to the controversy , to inquire without bounds , and judge without control .


Thus , my lords , I have laid before you my opinion of this bill without any partial regard , without exaggerating the ill consequences that may be feared from it , or endeavouring to elude any reasoning by which it has been defended .
I have endeavoured to pursue the arguments of the noble lord who spoke first , and to show that it is founded upon false notions of criminal justice , that it proposes irrational and illegal methods of trial , that it will produce consequences fatal to our constitution , and establish a precedent of oppression .


I have endeavoured , in examining the arguments by which the bill has been defended , to show that the rights of the publick are ascertained , and that the power of the majority is to be limited by moral considerations  and to prove , in discussing its particular parts , that it is inaccurate , indeterminate , and unintelligible .


What effects my inquiry may have had upon your lordships , yourselves only can tell  for my part , the necessity of dwelling so long upon the question , has added new strength to my conviction  and so clearly do I now see the danger and injustice of a law like this , that though I do not imagine myself indued with any peculiar degree of heroism , I believe , that if I were condemned to a choice so disagreeable , I should more willingly suffer by such a bill passed in my own case , than consent to pass it in that of another .


The duke of ARGYLE replied to the following effect : -- My lords , I am not yet able to discover that the bill now before us is either illegal or absurd , that its interpretation is doubtful , or its probable consequences dangerous .


The indisputable maxim , that the publick has a right to every man 's evidence , has been explained away with much labour , and with more art than a good cause can often require .
We have been told of publick contracts , of the rights of society with regard to individuals , and the privileges of individuals with respect to society  we have had one term opposed to another , only to amuse our attention  and law , reason , and sophistry have been mingled , till common sense was lost in the confusion .


But , my lords , it is easy to disentangle all this perplexity of ideas , and to set truth free from the shackles of sophistry , by observing that it is , in all civilized nations of the world , one of the first principles of the constitution , that the publick has a right , always reserved , of having recourse to extraordinary methods of proceeding , when the happiness of the community appears not sufficiently secured by the known laws .


Laws may , by those who have made the study and explanation of them the employment of their lives , be esteemed as the great standard of right  they may be habitually reverenced , and considered as sacred in their own nature , without regard to the end which they are designed to produce .


But others , my lords , whose minds operate without any impediment from education , will easily discover , that laws are to be regarded only for their use  that the power which made them only for the publick advantage ought to alter or annul them , when they are no longer serviceable , or when they obstruct those effects which they were intended to promote .


I will , therefore , my lords , still assert , that the publick has a right to every man 's evidence  and that to reject any bill which can have no other consequence than that of enabling the nation to assert its claim , to reconcile one principle of law with another , and to deprive villany of an evasion which may always be used , is to deny justice to an oppressed people , and to concur in the ruin of our country .


And farther , my lords , I confidently affirm it has not been proved , that this bill can endanger any but the guilty  nor has it been shown that it is drawn up for any other purpose than that which the noble lord mentioned , of hindering an inquiry from being impossible  it may , therefore , justly be required from those who affect , on this occasion , so much tenderness for liberty , so many suspicions of remote designs , and so much zeal for our constitution , to demonstrate , that either an inquiry may be carried on by other means , or that an inquiry is itself superfluous or improper .


Though none of those who have spoken against the bill have been willing to expose themselves to universal indignation , by declaring that they would gladly obstruct the progress of the inquiry  that they designed to throw a mist over the publick affairs , and to conceal from the people the causes of their misery  and though I have no right to charge those who differ from me in opinion , with intentions , which , as they do not avow them , can not be proved  this , however , I will not fear to affirm , that those who are for rejecting this method of inquiry , would consult their honour by proposing some other equally efficacious  lest it should be thought  by such as have not any opportunities of knowing their superiority to temptations , that they are influenced by some motives which they are not willing to own , and that they are , in secret , enemies to the inquiry , though , in publick , they only condemn the method of pursuing it .


The duke of NEWCASTLE next rose , and spoke to this effect : -- My lords , the arguments which have been produced in defence of the bill before us , however those who offer them may be influenced by them , have made , hitherto , very little impression upon me  my opinion of the impropriety and illegality of this new method of prosecution , still continues the same  nor can it be expected that I should alter it , till those reasons have been answered which have been offered by the noble lord who spoke first in the debate .


The advocates for the bill seem , indeed , conscious of the insufficiency of their arguments , and have , therefore , added motives of another kind  they have informed us , that our power subsists upon our reputation , and that our reputation can only be preserved by concurring in the measures recommended by the commons  they have insinuated to us , that he who obstructs this bill , will be thought desirous to obstruct the inquiry , to conspire the ruin of his country , and to act in confederacy with publick robbers .


But , my lords , whether the nation is really exasperated to such a degree as is represented , whether it is the general opinion of mankind that the publick affairs have been unfaithfully administered , and whether this bill has been dictated by a desire of publick justice , or of private revenge , I have not thought it necessary to inquire  having long learned to act in consequence of my own conviction , not of the opinions of others , at least , not of those who determine upon questions which they can not understand , and judge without having ever obtained an opportunity of examining .


Such , my lords , must be the opinions of the people upon questions of policy , opinions not formed by reflection , but adopted from those whom they sometimes , with very little reason , imagine nearer spectators of the government than themselves , and in whom they place an implicit confidence , on account of some casual act of popularity .


I shall not , therefore , think the demands of the people a rule of conduct , nor shall ever fear to incur their resentment in the prosecution of their interest .
I shall never flatter their passions to obtain their favour , or gratify their revenge for fear of their contempt .
The inconstancy , my lords , of publick applause , all of us have observed , and many of us have experienced  and we know that it is very far from being always the reward of merit .
We know that the brightest character may be easily darkened by calumny  that those who are labouring for the welfare of the publick , may be easily represented as traitors and oppressors  and that the people may quickly be persuaded to join in the accusation .


That the people , however deceived , have a right to accuse whomsoever they suspect , and that their accusation ought to be heard , I do not deny  but surely , my lords , the opinion of the people is not such a proof of guilt as will justify a method of prosecution never known before , or give us a right to throw down the barriers of liberty , and punish by power those whom we can not convict by law .


Let any of your lordships suppose himself by some accident exposed to the temporary malice of the populace , let him imagine his enemies inflaming them to a demand of a prosecution , and then proposing that he should be deprived of the common methods of defence , and that evidence should be hired against him , lest the publick should be disappointed , and he will quickly discover the unreasonableness of this bill .


I suppose no man will deny , that methods of prosecution introduced on one occasion , may be practised on another  and that in the natural rotations of power , the same means may be used for very different ends .
Nothing is more probable , my lords , if a bill of this kind should be ever passed , in compliance with the clamours of the people , to punish ministers , and to awe the court , than that it may in time , if a wicked minister should arise , be made a precedent for measures by which the court may intimidate the champions of the people  by which those may be pursued to destruction , who have been guilty of no other crime than that of serving their country in a manner which those who are ignorant of the circumstances of affairs , happen to disapprove .


The measures now proposed , my lords , are , therefore , to be rejected , because it is evident that they will establish a precedent , by which virtue may at any time be oppressed , but which can be very seldom necessary for the detection of wickedness  since there is no probability that it will often happen , that a man really guilty of enormous crimes can secure himself from discovery , or connect others with him in such a manner , that they can not impeach him without betraying themselves .


But , my lords , whenever virtue is to be persecuted , whenever false accusations are to be promoted , this method is incontestably useful  for no reward can so efficaciously prevail upon men who languish in daily fear of publick justice , as a grant of impunity .


It may be urged , my lords , I own , that all inquiries into futurity are idle speculations  that the expedient proposed is proper on the present occasion , and that no methods of justice are to be allowed , if the possibility of applying them to bad purposes , is a sufficient reason for rejecting them .


But to this , my lords , it may be answered with equal reason , that every process of law is likewise , in some degree , defective  that the complications of circumstances are variable without end , and , therefore , can not be comprised in any certain rule  and that we must have no established method of justice , if we can not be content with such as may possibly be sometimes eluded .


And , my lords , it may be observed farther , that scarcely any practice can be conceived , however generally unreasonable and unjust , which may not be sometimes equitable and proper  and that if we are to lay aside all regard to futurity , and act merely with regard to the present exigence , it may be often proper to violate every part of our constitution .
This house may sometimes have rejected bills beneficial to the nation  and if this reasoning be allowed , it might have been wise and just in the commons and the emperour to have suspended our authority by force , to have voted us useless on that occasion , and have passed the law without our concurrence .


With regard to the establishment of criminal prosecutions , as well as to our civil rights , we are , my lords , to consider what is , upon the whole , most for the advantage of the publick  we are not to admit practices which may be sometimes useful , but may be often pernicious , and which suppose men better or wiser than they are .
We do not grant absolute power to a wise and moderate prince , because his successours may inherit his power without his virtues  we are not to trust or allow new methods of prosecution upon an occasion on which they may seem useful , because they may be employed to purposes very different from those for which they were introduced .


Thus , my lords , I have shown the impropriety of the bill now before us , upon the most favourable supposition that can possibly be made  a supposition of the guilt of the noble person against whom it is contrived .
And surely , my lords , what can not even in that case be approved , must , if we suppose him innocent , be detested .


That he is really innocent , my lords , that he is only blackened by calumny , and pursued by resentment , can not be more strongly proved than by the necessity to which his enemies are reduced , of using expedients never heard of in this nation before , to procure accusations against him  expedients which they can not show to have been at any time necessary for the punishment of a man really wicked , and which , by bringing guilt and innocence into the same danger , leave us at liberty to imagine , that he is clear from the crimes imputed to him , even in the opinion of those who pursue him with the fiercest resentment , and the loudest clamours .


It may well be imagined , my lords , that those whom he has so long defeated by his abilities , see themselves now baffled by his innocence  and that they only now persecute his character , to hide the true reason for which they formerly attacked his power .


I hope , my lords , I shall be easily forgiven for observing , that this is a testimony of uncorrupted greatness , more illustrious than any former minister has ever obtained  for when was it known , my lords , that after a continuance of power for twenty years , any man , when his conduct became the subject of publick examination , was without accusers ?


I can not , for my part , but congratulate the noble person upon his triumph over malice  malice assisted by subtilty and experience , by wealth and power , which is at length obliged to confess its impotence , to call upon us to assist it with new laws , to enable it to offer a reward for evidence against him , and throw down the boundaries of natural justice , that he may be harassed , censured , and oppressed , upon whom it can not be proved that he ever deviated from the law , or employed his power for any other end than the promotion of the publick happiness .


Had the officers of the crown , my lords , when his influence was represented so great , and his dominion so absolute , projected any such measures for his defence  had they proposed to silence his opponents by calling them to a trial , and offered a stated price for accusations against them , how loudly would they have been charged with the most flagrant violation of the laws , and the most open disregard of the rights of nature  with how much vehemence would it have been urged , that they were intoxicated with their success , and that in the full security of power they thought themselves entitled to neglect the great distinctions of right and wrong , and determined to employ the law for the completion of those purposes , in which justice would give them no assistance .


I doubt not that your lordships will easily perceive , that this censure is equally just in either case  that you will not allow any man to be prosecuted by methods which he ought not to have used in his own case  that you will not expose any man to hardships , from which every other member of the community is exempt  that you will not suffer any man to be tried by hired evidence  and that you will not condemn him whom the law acquits .


Lord BATHURST spoke next , in substance as follows : -- My lords , the question under our consideration has been so long and so accurately debated , that little can be added to the arguments on either side  and therefore , though I think it necessary on so important an occasion , to make a solemn declaration of my opinion , I shall endeavour to support it , not so much by any arguments of my own , as by a recapitulation and comparison of those which have been already heard by your lordships .


It has not been denied , that the punishment of crimes is absolutely necessary to the publick security  and as it is evident , that crimes can not be punished unless they are detected , it must be allowed , that the discovery of wicked measures ought to be , in a very great degree , the care of those who are intrusted with the government of the nation  nor can they better discharge their trust , than by defeating the artifices of intrigue , and blocking up the retreats of guilt .


This , likewise , my lords , is admitted with such restrictions as seem intended to preclude any advantage that might be drawn from the appearance of a concession  for it is urged , that guilt is not to be detected by any methods which are not just , and that no methods are just which are not usual .


The first position , my lords , I have no intention to controvert  as it is not to violate justice , but to preserve it from violation , that this bill has been projected or defended .
But , my lords , it is to be observed , that they who so warmly recommend the strictest adherence to justice , seem not fully to understand the duty which they urge .
To do justice , my lords , is to act with impartiality , to banish from the mind all regard to personal motives , and to consider every question in its whole extent , without suffering the attention to be restrained to particular circumstances , or the judgment to be obstructed by partial affection .


This rule , my lords , seems not to have been very carefully observed , by the most vehement advocates for justice in the case before us  for they appear not to be solicitous that any should receive justice , but the person mentioned in the bill  they do not remember , that the publick has cried out for justice more than twenty years  for justice , which has not yet been obtained , and which can be obtained only by the method now proposed .


It is necessary , my lords , for those who are so watchful against the breach of justice , to prove that any means can be unjust which have no other tendency than the detection of wickedness , of wickedness too artful or too powerful to be punished by the common rules of law .


The introduction of new methods of prosecution , is the natural consequence of new schemes of villany , or new arts of evasion  nor is it necessary that precedents should be produced , when the wisdom of the legislature concurs in acknowledging the necessity of extraordinary measures .
Though our constitution is in the highest degree excellent , I never yet heard that it was perfect , and whatever is not perfect may be improved .
Our laws , however wise , are yet the contrivance of human policy  and why should we despair of adding somewhat to that which we inherit from our ancestors ?
Why should we imagine , that they anticipated every contingency , and left nothing for succeeding ages ?


I think , my lords , with the highest regard both of our laws , and those by whom they were enacted , but I look with no less veneration on this illustrious assembly  I believe your lordships equal to your progenitors in abilities  and therefore , since you can not but outgo them in experience , am confident that you may make improvements in the fabrick which they have erected  that you may adorn it with new beauties , or strengthen it with new supports .


It can not , at least , be denied , that your lordships have all the power of your ancestors  and since every law was once new , it is certain they were far from imagining that there was always a necessity of inquiring after precedents .
If the argument drawn from the want of precedents be now of any force , let it be proved that its force was less in any former reign  and let it be considered how our government could have attained its present excellence , had this house , instead of applying to every grievance its proper remedy , been amused with turning over journals , and looking upon every new emergence for precedents , of which it is certain that there must have been a time in which they were not to be found .


In all regulations established by the legislature , it is sufficient that they do not produce confusion by being inconsistent with former laws , that they unite easily with our constitution , and do not tend to the embarrassment of the machine of government .
This consideration , my lords , has been in a very remarkable manner regarded by those who drew up the bill before us  a bill of which the noble duke has proved , that it will be so far from perplexing our judicial proceedings , that it will reconcile the law to itself , and free us from the necessity of obeying one precept by the neglect of another .


The arguments of the noble duke are such as , in my opinion , can not be answered , or heard impartially without conviction .
The maxims quoted by him are each of them incontestably true  they are , on this occasion , incompatible  and this is the only method by which they can be reconciled .


Nor has he only shown the propriety of the bill by irrefragable reasons , but has proved , likewise , that it is consistent , not only with the constitution of our government , but with the practice of our ancestors  he has shown , that it may be supported not only by reason , but by bills of the same kind , enacted on occasions of far less importance .


He has proved , my lords , all that the most scrupulous inquirer can wish  he has made it evident , that the bill would be proper , though it were unprecedented  he has produced many precedents in support of it , and has thereby evinced , that the only present question is , whether it is just ?
To the precedents alleged by him , it has been objected , that they differ in some particulars .
But when , my lords , did any two actions , however common , agree in every circumstance ?
Relations may be complicated without end , and every new complication produces new appearances , which , however , are always to be disregarded , while the constituent principles remain unvaried .


If we consider the difficulties in which the opponents of the bill have involved themselves , it will not be easy to think well of a cause , which gives birth to such wild assertions , and extravagant opinions .
They have first , by requiring precedents , determined , that our constitution must be henceforward for ever at a stand  and then , by declaring that no precedents are of any weight , in which every circumstance is not parallel to the case in debate , have debarred us from the repetition of any occasional law  they have declared , almost in plain terms , themselves useless , and destroyed that authority at once , which they seem so much afraid of communicating to the commons .


But , by none of their arts of subtle distinction , my lords , have they been able to evade the argument which arises from the conformity of this bill to the common practice of our courts  an argument , which has produced no other answer than loud declamations  against the indecency of comparing with pickpockets and highwaymen , a noble person , a minister of acknowledged merit , long graced with the favour of his sovereign , and long invested with the highest trust .


I , my lords , am very far from pleasing myself with licentious or indecent language  I am far from envying any man that exaltation which he obtains either by good or by bad actions  and have no inclination of levelling the person , whose conduct I desire to see examined , with the profligate or infamous .
Yet I can not forbear to observe , that high rank is an aggravation of villany  that to have enjoyed the favour of his sovereign , is no defence of him that has abused it  and that high trust is an honour only to that man , who , when he lays down his office , dares stand an inquiry .


Had there been no precedent in our judicial proceedings , my lords , which bore any resemblance to this bill , there would not from thence have arisen any just objection .
Common proceedings are established for common occasions  and it seems to have been the principle of our ancestors , that it is better to give ten guilty persons an opportunity of escaping justice , than to punish one innocent person by an unjust sentence .
A principle which , perhaps , might not be erroneous in common cases , in which only one individual was injured by another , or when the trial was , by the law , committed to a common jury , who might easily be misled .


They might likewise imagine , my lords , that a criminal , encouraged by a fortunate escape to a repetition of his guilt , would undoubtedly some time fall into the hands of the law , though not extended on purpose to seize him  and , therefore , they constituted their proceedings in such a manner , that innocence might at least not be entrapped , though guilt should sometimes gain a reprieve .


But in the present case , my lords , every circumstance requires a different conduct .
By the crimes which this bill is intended to detect , not single persons , or private families , but whole nations , and all orders of men have long been injured and oppressed  and oppressed with such success , that the criminal has no temptation to renew his practices  nor is there any danger of an erroneous sentence , because the trial will be heard by this house , by persons whose integrity sets them above corruption , and whose wisdom will not be deceived by false appearances .


This consideration , my lords , affords an unanswerable reply to those who represent the bill as ill-concerted , because the evidence to be procured by it , is the testimony of men , partners , by their own confession , in the crimes which they reveal .


Every court , my lords , examines the credibility of a witness  and the known corruption of these men may be properly pleaded at the trial , where your lordships will balance every circumstance with your known impartiality , and examine how far every assertion is invalidated by the character of the witness , and how far it is confirmed by a corroboratory concurrence of known events , or supported by other testimonies not liable to the same exception .


Thus , my lords , it may be observed how quickly the clouds are dispersed with which interest or perverseness have endeavoured to obscure the truth , and how easily the strongest objections which the greatest abilities could raise against this bill are confuted , or how apparently , when they are closely examined , they confute themselves .


One of the objections that requires no answer is that which has been raised with regard to the extent of the indemnity offered in the bill , which , in the opinion of those that opposed it , ought to be restrained to particular persons .
But that it is chiefly , if not solely , intended to be applied to those who have refused to answer the questions of the committee , I believe every lord in this house is fully convinced  it was , however , necessary to draw it up in general terms , lest other artifices might have been employed , and lest , by pointing out particular persons , opportunity might have been given to deprive the publick of their evidence , by prevailing upon them to withdraw .


The bill was justly styled , by a noble lord , a bill to prevent an inquiry from being impossible .
The difficulty of inquiries for the publick is well known  and the difficulty arises chiefly from the inability of the people to reward their advocates , or their evidence .
The state of the court , my lords , is very different  the crown can not only pardon , but advance those that have , on any occasion , promoted its interest  and I hope it will not be too much power to be for once granted to the people , if they are empowered to throw a simple indemnification into the balance , and try whether with the slight addition of truth , and reason , and justice , it will be able to weigh down titles , and wealth , and power .


It has been urged , that there is danger lest this bill should become a precedent .
I hope , my lords , the same occasion will not often happen  and whenever it shall hereafter occur , the precedent of passing the bill will be much less dangerous than that of rejecting it .


I hope it is not necessary to say more on this occasion  yet I can not forbear to remind some lords of the fatal consequences which at critical conjunctures they have often dreaded , or appeared to dread , from a disagreement of this house with the commons .
At this time , in which the nation is engaged in war , when the whole continent is one general scene of discord and confusion  when the wisest counsels , the firmest unanimity , and the most vigorous measures are apparently necessary , it might not be improper to reflect , how unseasonably we shall irritate the commons by rejecting this bill , and how justly we shall exasperate the people , by showing them that their complaints and remonstrances are of no weight  that they must expect the redress of their grievances from some other power  and that we prefer the impunity of one man to the happiness and safety of the publick .


Lord ISLAY spoke next to the following purpose : -- My lords , as there has in this debate been very frequent mention of extraordinary cases , of new modes of wickedness , which require new forms of procedure , and new arts of eluding justice , which make new methods of prosecution necessary , I can not forbear to lay before your lordships my sentiments on this question  sentiments not so much formed by reflection as impressed by experience , and which I owe not to any superiour degree of penetration into future events , but to subsequent discoveries of my own errours .


I have observed , my lords , that in every collision of parties , that occasion on which their passions are inflamed , is always termed an extraordinary conjuncture , an important crisis of affairs , either because men affect to talk in strong terms of the business in which they are engaged , for the sake of aggrandizing themselves in their own opinion and that of the world , or because the present object appears greatest to their sight by intercepting others , and that is imagined by them to be really most important in itself , by which their own pleasure is most affected .


On these extraordinary occasions , my lords , the victorious have always endeavoured to secure their conquest , and to gratify their passions by new laws , by laws , even in the opinion of those by whom they are promoted , only justifiable by the present exigence .
And no sooner has a new rotation of affairs given the superiority to another party , than another law , equally unreasonable and equally new , is found equally necessary for a contrary purpose .
Thus is our constitution violated by both , under the pretence of securing it from the attack of each other , and lasting evils have been admitted for the sake of averting a temporary danger .


I have been too long acquainted with mankind to charge any party with insincerity in their conduct , or to accuse them of affecting to represent their disputes as more momentous than they appeared to their own eyes .
I know , my lords , how highly every man learns to value that which he has long contended for , and how easily every man prevails upon himself to believe the security of the publick complicated with his own .
I have no other intention in these remarks , than to show how men are betrayed into a concurrence in measures , of which , when the ardour of opposition has subsided , and the imaginary danger is past , they have very seldom failed to repent .


I do not remember , my lords , any deviation from the established order of our constitution , which has not afterwards produced remorse in those that advised it .
I have known many endeavour to obviate the evils that might be produced by the precedents which they have contributed to establish , by publick declarations of their repentance , and acknowledgments of their errour  and , for my part , I take this opportunity of declaring , that though I have more than once promoted extraordinary bills , I do not recollect one which I would not now oppose , nor one of which experience has not shown me , that the danger is greater than the benefit .


I have learned , at length , my lords , that our constitution has been so formed by the wisdom of our ancestors , that it is able to protect itself by its own powers , without any assistance from temporary expedients , which , like some kinds of medicines in the human body , may give it the appearance of uncommon vigour , but which , in secret , prey upon its noblest parts , and hurry it to a sudden decay .


But none of all the measures into which I have seen parties precipitated by acrimony and impetuosity , have I known parallel to the bill which is now defended in this house  a bill which I hope we shall have reason to term the wildest effort of misguided zeal , and the most absurd project that the enthusiasm of faction ever produced .


The particular clauses of this bill have been already examined with great acuteness and penetration , and have all been shown to be absurd or useless .
I shall , therefore , only add this observation , that the indemnification , however liberally offered , will be wholly , at the disposal of those who shall receive the examinations , by whom , when such discoveries are not made as they may happen to expect , the witnesses may be charged with reserve and insincerity , and be prosecuted for those crimes which could never have been known but by their own confession .


It is not impossible , but that if the bait of indemnification shall be found insufficient to produce testimonies against the noble person , a bill of pains and penalties may be attempted , to terrify those who are too wise to be ensnared by specious promises  for what may not be expected from those who have already sent their fellow-subjects to prison , only for refusing to accuse themselves ?


Nor can I discover , my lords , how the most abandoned villains will be hindered from procuring indemnity by perjury , or what shall exclude a conspirator against the life and government of his majesty from pardon , if he swears , that in a plot for setting the pretender on the throne , he was assisted by the counsels of the earl of ORFORD .


It has , indeed , been in some degree granted , that the bill requires some amendment , by proposing that the necessary alterations may be made to such parts of it as shall appear defective to the committee , which would , indeed , be highly expedient , if only some particular clauses were exceptionable  but , my lords , the intention of the bill is cruel and oppressive  the measures by which that intention is promoted are contrary to law , and without precedent  and the original principle is false , as it supposes a criminal previous to the crime .


It is urged as the most pressing argument by the advocates for the bill , that it ought to be passed to gratify the people .
I know not , my lords , upon what principles those who plead so earnestly for rigid justice , can endeavour to influence our decisions by any other motives  or why they think it more equitable to sacrifice any man to the resentment of the people , than to the malice of any single person  nor can conceive why it should be thought less criminal to sell our voices for popularity than for preferment .


As this is , therefore , my lords , a bill contrary to all former laws , and inconsistent with itself  as it only tends to produce a bad end by bad means , and violates the constitution not to relieve , but to oppress  as the parts , singly considered , are defective , and the whole grounded upon a false principle  it neither requires any longer debate , nor deserves any farther consideration  it is rather to be detested than criticised , and to be rejected without any superfluous attempt for its amendment .


[ The aforementioned lords were all who spoke in this debate .
The question being then put , Whether the bill should be committed ?
It passed in the negative .


Content 47 , Proxies 10 .
-- 57 .
Not content 92 , Proxies 17 .
-- 109 .


But a protest was entered on this occasion , signed by twenty-eight lords  the former part of it was drawn from the speech of the duke of ARGYLE , and the latter part of it from that of lord CARTERET . ]


HOUSE OF LORDS , MAY 20 , 1742 .


ON THE SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF TRADE AND NAVIGATION .


The same day that the lords read a first time the indemnification bill , they read also , for the first time , a bill sent from the commons , entitled , An Act for the better protecting and securing the trade and navigation of this kingdom in time of war .
As this bill had a remarkable rise , passed the commons without a division , and the end proposed by it was so commendable , it may be proper to give some account of it before we proceed to the debate thereon in the house of lords .


It may be remembered , that we have mentioned great cause of complaint on account of the losses sustained by the British merchants from the enemy 's privateers , who were not sufficiently checked .
The merchants and traders of London , Bristol , and other cities , having applied to the administration in vain , presented petitions to both houses , setting forth , among other things , `` that notwithstanding the growing insolence of the Spanish privateers , the applications of the suffering merchants for protection and redress , had been neglected  that numbers of his majesty 's most useful subjects have been reduced to want and imprisonment , or , compelled by inhuman treatment , and despairing of a cartel for the exchange of prisoners , had enlisted in the service of Spain  that there had been various neglects and delays in the appointment of convoys , and some of the commanders of the few that had been granted , deserted the ships under their care at sea , and left them as a prey to the enemy , '' etc. .


One petition farther says , `` That the want of ships of force properly stationed , encouraged the enemy to increase the number of their privateers . ''


Another , `` That most of the captures were almost on our coast , in the Channel and soundings , at a time when the naval force of Britain was greater than ever was known , a few ships of which might have ruined the enemy 's privateers . ''


One set of the petitioners apprehend , `` that most of the captures might have been prevented , had a few ships been properly stationed on this side cape Finisterre , and the commanders kept to the strictest duty . ''


Other petitioners `` are not a little alarmed , not only at the increase and number of the Spanish privateers lately equipped , but at the unexpected great strength the enemy have lately shown in the Mediterranean , by which their trade must become more precarious than ever . ''


The last petition delivered in was from the mayor , aldermen , and commons of the city of London , setting forth , `` that they had seen a powerful and well-provided fleet remain inactive in our own ports , or more ingloriously putting to sea , without the appearance of any enterprise in view  while our trading vessels were daily exposed to the privateers of an inconsiderable port , and a feeble enemy holds our naval power in derision , to the ruin of trade , the enriching the enemy , and the disgrace of the British name . ''


Their general request is , `` that they may have regular convoys , and that the commanders be ordered not to desert their charge when in danger , that cruisers be properly stationed , subject to such inspection as shall best answer the end designed . ''


They all concluded with praying , `` that the house would make such provision for the future security of the navigation and commerce of these kingdoms as they shall think fit . ''


The petitions were severally referred to the consideration of a committee of the whole house , and the following orders made for necessary papers to be laid before the house .


1 .
An account of his majesty 's ships of war which have been employed since the beginning of last year , as cruisers for the protection of the trade of this kingdom on this side cape Finisterre , the stations of such ships , and how long ordered to continue thereupon , with the times of their going to sea , and their returning into port  when such ships were cleared , and which of them tallowed , and when respectively .


2 .
The journals of the commanders of such of his majesty 's ships of war as have been employed since the commencement of the present war , as cruisers for the protection of trade on this side cape Finisterre .


3 .
An account of the ships of war built in any of his majesty 's yards , which have been launched since July , 1739 , the times when launched , when first put to sea , and on what services employed .


4 .
An account of the ships of war built in private yards for his majesty 's service , in the said time  distinguishing the times when contracted for , when launched , when first put to sea , and on what services employed .


5 .
An account of the ships and vessels purchased for his majesty 's service since the said time , distinguishing when purchased , when first put to sea , and what services employed in .


6 .
An account of the ships of war appointed as convoys to the trade of this kingdom to foreign parts , since the commencement of the present war , distinguishing the ships appointed , and the particular services , together with the notices given to the traders of the time prefixed for their sailing , and the times they sailed respectively .


7 .
That his majesty be addressed for the report of the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral to his majesty in council , upon the petition of the merchants , relating to their losses during the war , to be laid before the house .


8 .
That the schoolmaster and a mariner on board his majesty 's ship , the Duke , do attend the said committee .


Six days after these orders passed , the said accounts and report were presented to the house by the secretary of the admiralty .


There were also laid before them copies of above one hundred letters , from and to the secretary of state , admirals , ambassadours , consuls , commanders of his majesty 's ships , and trading vessels  from the commissioners of the sick and hurt seamen , with heads of a cartel for exchange of prisoners  and memorials and representations from merchants .


Also a list of ships taken since the commencement of the war , and of the prisoners made by the enemy , also letters from several of them relating to their treatment , and from the captain-general of the province where the said seamen were imprisoned , relating to an exchange  several certificates and depositions , and a proposal by the lords of the admiralty for a general exchange of prisoners  also copies of the orders of the commissioners of admiralty to captains and commanders on the enemy 's coast .


Petitions from the wives of seamen taken prisoners  letters to and from the principal officers of the enemy , prisoners in Britain , relating to the exchange .


Certificates of the discharge of several prisoners , by the enemy , on promise that a like number of the prisoners in Britain should be discharged .


The secretary of the Admiralty also laid before the house a book of the regulations and instructions relating to the sea-service , established by his majesty in council .


These requisites being laid before the house of commons , they went into a committee on the twenty-third day of their sitting , heard one of the petitioners , several witnesses , and desired to sit again .


In the mean time were presented to the house seventeen other letters concerning sea affairs , and an account when the East India company first applied , since the war began , for a convoy to St. Helena , and when they sailed , and what number of ships came under the said convoy , and on the twenty-fifth day of sitting the committee heard more witnesses .


Next day they proceeded , when an account was brought in of the Spanish prisoners released , by what orders , and on what conditions  also an account of the number of seamen employed the last year , distinguishing how many at home , and how many abroad , also of the number of ships and vessels of war , distinguishing the rates .


The secretary of the admiralty also presented a list of the names of the merchant ships , and the masters , as have behaved so negligently as to delay the convoys from whom they had taken sailing orders , or that have abandoned the same , or that have been any ways disobedient to the instructions established for good government , with the narration of the facts since the beginning of the war .


Also copies of the reasons given , in writing , by such commanders of his majesty 's ships as have been appointed in this war as cruisers on this side cape Finisterre , for leaving their stations , or for coming into port , before the time required by their orders , which papers were sixty-one in number .


All which were referred to the said committee , and then they heard some other evidence , and after farther proceeding desired leave to sit again .


Next day the secretary of the admiralty presented copies of all applications for convoys for ships and cruisers , and what was done thereon , which papers were above forty , of which eight were petitions to get convoys for single ships .


All which papers and accounts were referred to the said committee , which was to proceed again on the twenty-eighth day , but the houses were desired to adjourn for fifteen days .


When the house met again , the said secretary presented copies of all complaints made since the war began , to the commissioners of the admiralty , against , or relating to commanders leaving the trade under their convoy , or their stations , or for impressing seamen out of outward-bound ships after clearance , or homeward-bound before they reached their port , or for other misbehaviour , or injury done by them to trade , with an account of what has been done thereupon .


These papers , including the complaints and the orders given thereupon , which are much the greater part , with justifications from the commanders , were in number forty  but we ought not to omit that amongst them there is a representation of the Portugal merchants in favour of one commander , captain Ambrose , who had taken several of the enemy 's privateers .


On the thirty-third day of sitting were presented , from the office for the sick and wounded seamen , copies of the returns from such persons as have been empowered to pay his majesty 's bounty to the British subjects , prisoners in the ports of Spain , distinguishing the number of men paid each month , and what ships they belonged to , and when taken .


Also an account of the number of men who have been put sick on shore from his majesty 's ships , into the hospitals last year , distinguishing how many died , and how many were returned to the ships , or run away , or were otherwise disposed of .


Which papers were referred to the said committee , and the house went into it , heard farther evidence , and the chairman desired leave to sit again .


Accordingly they proceeded on this affair the thirty-fifth day , and heard farther evidence .


On the thirty-seventh day more papers were laid before the house , being three several orders issued by the admiralty to the commanders of his majesty 's ships in the ports of Portugal , or such as shall have occasion to put into the said ports  also an estimate of the debt of the navy  which were referred to the said committee , and the house went into it , and came to several resolutions , which were reported the next day , and are as follow .


The first resolution was , that it appeared to the committee , that notwithstanding the repeated applications of the merchants for cruisers to be properly stationed for the protection of the trade of this nation from the privateers of Spain , the due and necessary care has not been taken to keep a proper number of his majesty 's ships employed in that service , more especially in and near the Channel and soundings  for want of which , many ships had been taken by the enemy , some of them of considerable value , to the great loss of many of his majesty 's subjects , the great advantage and encouragement of the enemy , and the dishonour of this nation .
II .
That the detention of the ships bound to Portugal for near twelve months , by the refusal of protections for some time , and the delay of convoys afterwards , gave our rivals in trade an opportunity of introducing new species of their woollen manufactures into Portugal , to the great detriment of this kingdom .


Upon this foundation , the house ordered that a bill be brought in for the better protecting and securing the trade and navigation of this kingdom in times of war  and that the lord mayor of London ( since deceased ) and sir John BARNARD , do prepare and bring in the same .


On the first day of April , being the fifty-ninth of their sitting , the lord mayor of London presented , according to order , a bill for the better protecting and securing the trade and navigation of this kingdom in time of war  and the same was received and read a first time , and ordered to be read a second time , and to be printed .


By reason of some omission , we do not find when the bill was read a second time  but , on the seventy-second sitting , a day was appointed to go into a committee on the seventy-ninth , when they did , and made several amendments , which were reported on the eighty-second day , and with amendments to one of them , were agreed to , and ordered to be engrossed .
At their eighty-seventh sitting the bill was read a third time and passed , and the lord mayor of London was ordered to carry the bill to the lords , and desire their concurrence .
And three days after it was read by their lordships a first time , and is as follows  the words within these marks [ ] showing how the blanks were filled up , and the amendments made in its progress through the house of commons , with notes of the words left out .


An Act for the better protecting and securing of the trade and navigation of this kingdom in times of war .


`` Whereas it is necessary , in times of war , that a sufficient number of ships should be appointed , and kept constantly employed , as cruisers , in proper stations , for the protection and security of the trade and navigation of this kingdom  be it enacted by the king 's most excellent majesty , by and with the advice and consent of both houses of the senate in this present council assembled , and by the authority of the same , that when and as often as this kingdom shall be engaged in war with any kingdom or state in Europe , ( over and above the ships of war for the line of battle , and for convoys to remote parts , ) such a number of ships of war as shall be sufficient for the protection and security of the merchant-ships , in their going out and returning home , shall be constantly employed as cruisers , or for convoys , in and near the British Channel and soundings , and in such other stations on this side cape Finisterre , as shall by the lord high admiral , or commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of Great Britain for the time being , be judged most proper for that purpose  the aforesaid ships of war to be careened at least [ three ] times in the year , or oftener , if there be occasion  and that the seamen on board any such cruisers shall not be turned over into any other ship or ships , but such only as shall be appointed for cruising , or home convoys , according to the tenour of this act .


( 2 . )
`` Provided always , and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid , that nothing herein contained shall restrain , or be construed to restrain , the lord high admiral or commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral for the time being , from directing any of the ships which shall be appointed to be cruisers in pursuance of this act , to be employed in the line of battle , ( in case of great necessity , ) on this side cape Finisterre , without whose immediate direction , the said ships shall be always cruising , or employed as home convoys , except when they are careening or refitting .


( 3 . )
`` And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid , that the lord high admiral , or commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral for the time being , shall , on or before the [ first day of July next ] authorize and appoint a commissioner of the navy , or some one or more person or persons , who shall constantly reside at such place or places as his majesty shall direct  by virtue of which appointment , such person or persons , in the place or places for which he or they shall be appointed , shall superintend or oversee every thing relating to the aforesaid cruisers  and shall take care that every thing necessary be immediately provided for all and every the aforesaid cruising ships of war , that shall come into any port by stress of weather , or to careen or refit  and as soon as they or any of them are refitted , shall order all or any of the said ships of war to put to sea again as soon as possible .


( 4 . )
`` And be it farther enacted by the authority aforesaid , that from and after the said [ first day of July ] if any captain , or other officer on board any of his majesty 's ships of war , shall wilfully spring , carry away , or lose any mast or masts of any such ship [ Footnote : Left out , or ships . ]
, or shall make any false pretence or excuse for leaving the station on which such ship or ships shall be appointed to cruise , or shall return into port before the expiration of the term appointed for his cruise , without just and sufficient reason for so doing , every captain or officer offending in any of the aforesaid cases , [ shall be punished by fine , imprisonment , or otherwise , as the offence by a court-martial shall be adjudged to deserve . ]


( 5 . )
`` And to the intent that it may be the more easily known what service the aforesaid cruisers shall every year perform , be it enacted by the authority aforesaid , that the commissioner of the navy in each of the outports , or such person or persons as shall , for that purpose , be appointed by the lord high admiral , or commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral for the time being , shall transmit to him or them , every [ three months ] a distinct and separate account digested into proper columns , of the time when any of the ships appointed to be cruisers , sailed out of port , when such ship came in , together with the number of days , cast up , that such ship was out upon duty , and the reasons of her putting into port , and the time and reasons of her stay there  with an account how often , and the times when each of the said ships have been careened every year  and that the lord high admiral , or commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral , for the time being , shall cause copies of the said accounts to be laid before both houses of the senate within [ eight days ] after their meeting .


( 6 . )
`` And be it farther enacted by the authority aforesaid , that the lord high admiral , or commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral , for the time being , shall , on or before the said [ first day of July ] nominate and appoint such a number of the ships of war , as shall be sufficient for the purposes aforementioned , to be cruisers or convoys on this side cape Finisterre for the current year  and shall afterwards yearly , and every year , during the present or any future war , between the [ first day of November ] and the [ first day of December ] nominate and appoint a sufficient number of ships of war to be cruisers or convoys on this side cape Finisterre for the year ensuing  and as often as any of them shall happen to be taken or lost , shall , as soon as may be , appoint others in the room of every ship so taken or lost .


( 7 . )

''


HOUSE OF LORDS , JUNE 1 , 1742 .


The bill for the security and protection of trade and navigation being this day read a second time in the house of lords , the earl of WINCHELSEA , who had lately accepted the chair at the admiralty board , rose and spoke as follows :


My lords , I know not by what accident the numerous defects and general impropriety of this bill have escaped the attention of the other house  nor is there any necessity for examining the motives upon which it passed , or of inquiring whether its reception was facilitated by the popularity of the title , the influence and authority of those by whom it was proposed , or the imaginary defects of our present regulations , which have been on some occasions represented to be such as it is scarcely possible to change but for the better .


The knowledge and experience of those who concurred in sending this bill for your lordships ' approbation , can not but produce some degree of prepossession in its favour  for how can it be imagined , my lords , that men of great abilities and continual opportunities of observation , should not be well versed in questions relating chiefly to their private interest , and discover the nearest way to their own success !


And yet , my lords , it will be found that their sagacity has , perhaps , never so apparently forsaken them as on this occasion , that no proposition was ever laid before this house , in which more contracted motives were discovered , and that the bill is such as might rather have been expected from petty traders , unacquainted with the situation of kingdoms , the interests of princes , the arts of policy , the laws of their own country , and the conduct of former wars  than by merchants of extensive traffick , general correspondence , and great attainments .


Before I proceed , my lords , to confirm the character of the bill by a distinct consideration of the particular paragraphs , and an enumeration of the several improprieties and defects which may be found in it , I think it not superfluous or unseasonable to remark one general errour , common to this with all other laws of the same kind , the errour of prescribing rules to military operations , of attempting to fix what is , in its own nature , variable , as it must depend upon external causes to which the British legislature has yet found no means of extending its authority .


To direct , upon remote conjectures and uncertain prospects , the conduct of a commander , is , in my opinion , my lords , not more rational than to trace upon a chart the course of a ship , and pronounce it criminal to deviate from it .
The one supposes a foreknowledge of the motions of the wind , and the other of the counsels of our enemies  nor can any thing be expected from such regulations , but overthrow and disgrace .
I believe , my lords , that in running over the histories of the world , and examining the originals of the mightiest empires , and the sudden revolutions which have been produced by the overpowering torrents of war , which , at different periods of time , have swept the powers of the earth before them , it will be found that all rapid conquests , and sudden extensions of empire , have been effected by sovereign princes at the head of armies which acted only by immediate command , that few memorable actions have been performed by delegated commanders , and that of those few whose names have descended to posterity , those have generally been most successful who were invested with the largest powers , who acted without control , and were at liberty to snatch every opportunity , and improve every favourable conjuncture , without any necessity of communicating their schemes , of waiting for the result of tedious deliberations , or of soliciting a relaxation of former orders .


But , my lords , though , perhaps , all positive prescriptions of the conduct of military undertakings have a tendency rather to obstruct than promote success , yet as they may be drawn up with different degrees of wisdom and sagacity , they may have a greater or less appearance of usefulness and reason .
Such as have been well concerted may afford useful hints , though they ought not to be enacted with indispensable obligations .
And to consider even those in which less proofs of skill and foresight can be discovered , may have , at least , this advantage , that the proposals may not be speedily repeated , nor our counsels embarrassed with absurd expedients .
I shall , therefore , lay before your lordships my opinion of every paragraph , and show what are the objections which may be raised , both to the whole bill in general , and to its particular clauses .


To the bill in general , it must be objected , that it is filled with vague expressions , and ideas so indeterminate , that no man can tell when he has obeyed it .
Here are many rules ordered to be observed , when there shall be no just and sufficient reason for neglecting them , and some operations to be performed as often as there shall be occasion , and ships are to cruise in a certain latitude , unless there is a necessity of employing them elsewhere .


Did not the title of this bill , my lords , give it some claim to a serious consideration  and did not the integrity and capacity of those by whom it was drawn up , exempt them from contempt and ridicule , I should be inclined to treat a law like this with some degree of levity  for who , my lords , can be serious when his consent is desired to a bill , by which it is enacted , that men shall act on certain occasions , as they shall think most expedient ?


Nor is this , my lords , the only instance of precipitancy and want of consideration , for many of the injunctions are without any penal sanction  so that though we should pass this bill with the greatest unanimity , we should only declare our opinion , or offer our advice , but should make no law , or what , with regard to the purposes of government , is the same , a law which may be broken without danger .


But general objections , my lords , will naturally produce general evasions  and a debate may be prolonged without producing any clear view of the subject , or any satisfactory decision of a single question : I shall , therefore , endeavour to range my objections in order , and , by examining singly every paragraph of the bill , show the weakness of some expedients , the superfluity of others , and the general unfitness of the whole to produce the protection and security intended by it .


In the first clause alone may be found instances of all the improprieties which I have mentioned to your lordships .
It is proposed that in a time of war between this empire and any other state , such a number of ships shall be employed as cruisers or convoys in the Channel , as the admiralty shall judge most proper for that purpose .
What is this , my lords , but to continue to the admiralty the power which has been always executed ?
What is it but to enact that the ships shall be stationed in time of war as the commissioners of the admiralty shall determine and direct ?


Of these ships , it is farther enacted , that they shall be careened three times a-year , or oftener if there shall be occasion  but it is not declared who shall judge of the necessity of careening , or who shall be punished for the neglect of it when it is requisite , or for the permission or command of it when it is superfluous .


There is yet another regulation , my lords , in this clause , which ought not to be passed without remark .
It is provided , that the sailors employed in the cruisers and convoys in the Channel , shall not be turned over but to other cruisers and convoys  by which , I suppose , it was intended , that our outguards should be prevented from being weakened , and that our merchants should never be destitute of protection  an end truly laudable , and which deserves to be promoted by some establishment better concerted .
The expedient now proposed , seems to have been contrived upon the supposition that the admiralty may not always be very solicitous for the safety of the merchants , and that , therefore , it is necessary to secure them by a law from the danger of being deprived of protection  for , upon the present establishment , the removal of men from one ship to another must be made by the permission of the admiralty  and when the right of such permission shall by this law be taken away , what new security will the merchants obtain ?
The admiralty will still have the power , though not of turning over the men , yet of recalling the ships , and commerce suffer equally in either case .


By the second clause , my lords , there is still a power reserved to the admiralty , of dismissing these guardians of commerce from their stations , and employing them in case of great necessity in the line of battle , on this side cape Finisterre .
Not to cavil , my lords , at the term of great necessity , of which it is apparent that the commissioners of the admiralty are to judge , I would desire to be informed what measures are to be taken , if a royal navy should unluckily rove beyond this cape , which is marked out as the utmost bound of the power of the admiralty , and should there be reduced to the necessity of engaging desperately with a superiour force , or retiring ignominiously before it .
Are not our ships to pass a single league beyond their limits , in the honour or preservation of their country ?
Are they to lie unactive within the sound of the battle , and wait for their enemies on this side the cape ?


The third clause , my lords , is , if not absurd like the former , yet so imperfectly drawn up , that it can produce no advantage  for of what use will it be to station an officer where his majesty shall think fit ?
At all the royal docks there are officers already stationed , and in any other place what can an officer , deputed by his majesty , do more than hire workmen , who will as cheerfully and as diligently serve any other person ?
And why may not the captain of the vessel procure necessaries for money , without the assistance of a commissioner ?


In the fourth clause , my lords , nothing is proposed but what is every day practised , nor any authority conferred upon the court of admiralty , than that which it always possessed , of punishing those who disobey their orders .
The provision against the crime of wilfully springing a mast , is at least useless  for when did any man admit that he sprung his mast by design ?
Or why should it be imagined that such an act of wickedness , such flagrant breach of trust , and apparent desertion of duty , would in the present state of the navy escape the severest punishment ?
Would not all the officers and mariners on board the ship see that such a thing was wilfully done ?
Would not they cry out -- `` You are springing the mast , '' and prevent it , or discover the crime , and demand punishment ?


The fifth clause , my lords , is without any penal sanction , and , therefore , can not be compulsive  nor is any thing of importance proposed in it , which is not already in the power of the senate .
Either house may now demand an account of the stations and employments of the ships of war  nor does the senate now omit to examine the conduct of our naval affairs , but because our attention is diverted by more important employments , which will not by this bill be contracted or facilitated .


The use of the provision in the sixth clause , my lords , I am not able to conceive  for to what purpose , my lords , should the ships appointed for any particular service be nominated at any stated time ?
What consequence can such declarations of our designs produce , but that of informing our enemies what force they ought to provide against us ?
In war , my lords , that commander has generally been esteemed most prudent , who keeps his designs most secret , and assaults the enemy in an unguarded quarter , with superiour and unexpected strength .


In the seventh clause , many regulations are prescribed to the commanders of those ships which are appointed to convoy the trading vessels .
These regulations , my lords , are not all equally unreasonable , but some of them are such as it may , on many occasions , be impossible for the commanders of his majesty 's ships to observe in such a manner as that the masters of merchant ships may not imagine themselves neglected or forsaken .
The captain of the convoy may be , therefore , harassed by them with prosecutions , in which it may be difficult to make his innocence appear .
The convoy may be sometimes accused of deserting the traders , when the traders in reality have forsaken the convoy , in confidence that they should either arrive safe at the port without protection , or be able , if they should happen to fall into the enemy 's hands , to charge their misfortune upon the negligence of their protector .


The eighth clause , my lords , is so far from being such as might be expected from merchants , that it seems rather to have been drawn up by men who never saw the sea , nor heard of the violence of a storm .
For who that had the slightest idea of the uncertainty and hazard of a sailor 's condition , who that had been ever told of a shipwreck , or but looked on the pictures of naval distress , would propose that no ship should retire to a harbour , or quit the station to which it was assigned , on any pretence whatsoever without permission , which sometimes could not be obtained in many months , and which never could be received soon enough to allow of a remedy for sudden disasters , or pressing calamities .
It might with equal reason be enacted , that no man should extinguish a fire without an act of the senate , or repel a thief from his window , without a commission of array .


It is happy , my lords , that this clause is not enforced by a penalty , and , therefore , can never have the obligatory sanction of a law  but since it may reasonably be supposed , that the authors of it intended that the observation should be by some means or other enjoined , let us examine how much security it would add to our navigation , and how much strength to our naval power , if the breach of it had been made capital , which is in itself by no means unreasonable  for what punishment less than death can secure the observation of a law , which , without the hazard of life , can not be obeyed ?


Let us , therefore , my lords , suppose a crew of gallant sailors surprised in their cruise by such a hurricane as is frequent in the American seas , which the highest perfection of skill , and the utmost exertion of industry has scarcely enabled them to escape  let us consider them now with their masts broken , their ship shattered , and their artillery thrown into the sea , unable any longer either to oppose an enemy , or to resist the waves , and yet forbidden to approach the land , and cut off from all possibility of relief , till they have represented their distress to some distant power , and received a gracious permission to save their lives .


Misery like this , my lords , admits no exaggeration , nor need I dwell long on the absurdity of establishing regulations which can not be observed , and which if they were enforced by any sanctions , proportioned , as all penal sanctions ought to be , to the temptations of violating them , must drive all our sailors into foreign service , or urge them , upon the first distress , to defiance of law , and fill America with pirates , and with rebels .


By the ninth clause , my lords , nothing is proposed but a relaxation of the present discipline .
It requires , that the commanders of ships of war shall send only once in six months those accounts of their conduct and their service , which they are at present obliged to transmit by every ship that returns from America  so that by passing this bill , we shall only be disabled from receiving regular and seasonable informations of the transactions of our distant squadrons and colonies , shall be disturbed with groundless suspicions , and tortured with unnecessary suspense .


I have arrived at length at the last clause , a clause , my lords , worthy to be the concluding paragraph of a bill like this  a clause in which the power of the admiralty is communicated to the governours of our colonies  men , my lords , not hitherto much celebrated for their superiour wisdom , moderation , or integrity  of whom , at least , it is no reproach to assert , that they are known to be , for the most part , wholly unacquainted with maritime affairs , and very little famed for military knowledge  and of whom it is above all to be considered , that they generally commence merchants at their arrival in America , and may more probably direct ships sent to guard the colonies , to stations in which they may preserve their own vessels , than to those where they may contribute most to the general security of trade .


Thus my lords , I have examined without prejudice every paragraph of this bill , and believe , that from the objections which I have made , it appears now plainly to your lordships , that all the regulations which are of any use , are such as are already established by long custom , or by former statutes  and such , therefore , as it is unnecessary to mention in a new law  and that whatever is here to be found new , is absurd , unintelligible , or pernicious .


This bill , my lords , is said to be founded on the act made for the same purpose , in the wars of the queen Anne  but I can not forbear to observe , that the original law , though not one of those to which much of the success of that war is to be ascribed , was drawn up with more discernment than the bill before us .
It was , at least , intelligible  the number of cruisers was limited , and it was , therefore , possible to know when it was obeyed  but of this bill I can confidently assert , that as no man can understand , so no man can observe it .


I have spoken more largely , my lords , on this occasion , because this bill relates particularly to my present employment , in which , as I desire to do my duty , I desire to know it  and , surely , I can not be condemned by your lordships for opposing a bill , of which the only tendency is to make my province difficult , to render one part of my office inconsistent with another , and engage me in the task of superintending the execution of impracticable measures .


What influence my arguments will have upon your lordships , I can not foresee .
As every man flatters himself that his own opinions are right , I hope to find this house concurring in my sentiments  but whatever may be the determination of your lordships , I am so fully convinced of the pernicious tendency of this bill , and the embarrassments which must be produced by an attempt to execute it , that if it be not rejected by this house , I shall willingly resign my office to others of more courage , or of greater abilities  for I can have no hopes of performing my duty under these restrictions , either to my own honour , or to the advantage of my country .


The duke of BEDFORD spoke next , to the following effect : -- My lords , though the noble lord has produced very specious arguments against every paragraph of the bill before us , and though many of his observations are just , and some of his objections not easily to be answered , yet I can not admit that it will produce those fatal consequences which he seems to foresee , nor am yet convinced that it will be either pernicious or useless .


It has always , my lords , been the practice of this house , to attend to every proposal for the publick advantage , to consider it without any regard to the character of those by whom it is offered , and to approve or reject it upon no other motives than those of justice and reason .


The same equity and prudence has always influenced your lordships to distinguish between the several parts of the same bill  to reject those expedients , of which , however plausible , either experience or reason may discover the impropriety , and to retain those from which any real benefit can reasonably be expected .
We should never throw away gold because it is mingled with dross , or refuse to promote the happiness of the nation , because the expedients which were offered for that end happened to be conjoined with some others of a disputable nature .


By the prosecution of this method , a method , my lords , too rational and just to be neglected or forgotten , I doubt not but this bill , which , as I shall readily admit , is not yet perfect , may be improved into a law , from which the nation will receive great advantages , by which our trade will be extended , and our riches increased .


Many of the clauses , my lords , may , in my opinion , admit of an easy vindication , others may be amended by very slight alterations , and very few are either wholly useless , or manifestly improper .


The chief defect of the first clause is such , that the noble lord has , by declaring his disapprobation of it , given a very uncommon proof of his integrity , disinterestedness , and moderation  for it is imperfect only by placing too much confidence in the admiralty , which is left in full power to determine the number of cruisers in or near the Channel and soundings .


The noble lord has remarked , that the act of queen Anne , on which the present bill is founded , exacted a determinate number of ships to be employed in this particular service , and that it was , therefore , more prudently drawn up than the present bill .
But I can not see the wisdom of diminishing the authority of the lord high admiral  for had that act been extended in the same manner to other services , it would have left him only the name and shadow of an office , without power and without use .


This clause , my lords , rightly understood , is only a declaration of confidence in his majesty 's officers , an evident confession of their abilities to discern the interest of the publick , and of their zeal for the prosecution of it .


With as little reason , my lords , can it be objected , that the ships are required to be careened three times a-year .
The necessity of careening frequently those ships , of which the chief use arises from their celerity , every sailor can declare to your lordships  nor will any man whom his employments or his amusements have made acquainted with navigation , allege that any thing is proposed in the bill , which it would not be detrimental to the publick service to neglect .


It has been objected by the noble lord , that they are directed to be careened oftener , if there be occasion  terms by which a discretionary power is implied , of which yet it does not appear in whose hands it is lodged .
Let us consider , my lords , what inconvenience can arise from the clause as it now stands , and what corruption or negligence can be encouraged by it .


The discretionary right of bringing the ship into the ports to be careened oftener than thrice a-year , must be , without controversy , placed in the captain  for none but those that are in the ship can discover the necessity of careening it , or know the inconveniencies that are produced by the adhesion of extraneous substances to its sides and bottom .


I own , my lords , it may be objected , that every captain will , by this clause , be furnished with an excuse for deserting his station at pleasure  that under pretence of uncommon ardour to pursue the enemy , he may waste his time in endless preparations for expedition  that he may loiter in the port to careen his ship  that before it is foul he may bring it back again , and employ the crew in the same operation  and that our merchants may be taken at the mouth of the harbours in which our ships of war lie to be careened .


But , my lords , it is to be remembered , that in the third clause a commissioner is appointed , by whom accounts are regularly to be transmitted to the admiralty , of the arrival and departure of every ship , and by whom the conduct of every captain is to be inspected  and that he may easily detect such truant commanders , as shall careen their ships only for the sake of deserting their stations .


Nor can the merchants suffer by any negligence or corruption of the captains , because it is intended that the place of every ship returning into port shall be supplied by another  and that the same number shall be always in the same station , unless more important service makes them more necessary in another place .


This proviso , my lords , a proviso undoubtedly reasonable , is established in the second clause , but has not had the good fortune to escape the censure of the noble lord , who has inquired , what must be the conduct of the commanders of cruising vessels , if a seafight should happen beyond the cape , which they are in this clause forbidden to pass ?


That the clause may admit of expressions not only more proper , but more agreeable to the intention of those by whom it was drawn up , I can not deny  for I suppose it very far from their design to limit the operations of our navy to any part of the ocean , and am confident that they meant only that the cruisers should not be despatched to such a distance from their stations , as that our coasts should be left long unguarded , or the enemy have time to collect his forces , and pour his navies or his privateers upon our defenceless traders .


If by the commissioners mentioned in the third clause be intended a new swarm of officers , the proposition is such as I confess myself very far from approving  for it will be to little purpose that we protect the trade , if we invent new commissioners to devour its profits  nor can we hope for any other consequence from additional wealth , if it be procured by increasing the influence of the crown , but that we should become a more tempting prey to the harpies of a court .


But , my lords , to accomplish all that is intended by this clause , there is not any need of new officers  for there are not many ports in which ships of war can be commodiously careened , and perhaps there is not one which can be used for this purpose , in which there is not already some officer of the crown , whose employment allows him leisure sufficient for the execution of a new charge , and whose present salary will afford an ample recompense for some casual addition of employment .


The fourth clause , in which is provided that no commander shall wilfully spring his mast , or desert his station , is such as I should be willing , with the noble lord , to think unnecessary  but must appeal to your lordships , whether the late conduct of the convoys has not too evidently shown the defect of our present establishment .


The injuries , my lords , which the publick may suffer by the negligence of the commanders of the ships of war , are such as it is worthy of the legislature to obviate with the utmost caution  and , therefore , it is by no means improper to enact a punishment for those who shall , upon any false pretences , leave their station  for though such neglect of duty is , in the present state of our naval establishment , considered as disreputable and irregular , yet it does not appear that it has been censured with the detestation which it deserves , or punished with the severity necessary to its prevention .


It is observed , my lords , with relation to the following paragraph , that either house may , at present , require accounts of the conduct of the captains of the navy , and that , therefore , it is unnecessary to provide , by any new law , that they shall be laid before them  but if it be considered , my lords , how many inquiries , which we have a right to make , are year after year constantly omitted , and how many may be excited by curiosity to read accounts which lie before them , who yet will not move the house to demand the accounts , or engage in the debate which such a motion may produce , it will not be thought unnecessary to provide , that they shall be subject to examination without the formality of a regular vote .


As to the sixth clause , my lords , which regards the nomination of convoys at a certain time , I can discover no reasonable objection to such a provision , or none that can preponderate against the advantages which may arise from it .
By the certain establishment of convoys , the value of insurance may be nearly fixed  merchants will know what confidence is to be reposed in the force of the ships , and , what they have , perhaps , had of late equal reason to examine , how much trust can be placed in the fidelity of the commanders .


The nomination of convoys , my lords , is , in my opinion , more likely to affright our enemies , and to deter their attempts , than to encourage them by the information which it will afford them  for nothing but our own negligence can conceal from us the naval strength of any power on earth  and we may always , while we are careful to preserve our maritime superiority , protect our merchants so powerfully , that none of our enemies shall be incited to attack them by the knowledge of the number and force of the ships appointed for their defence .


I come now , my lords , to the seventh clause  and surely to ascertain the duties of the captains to whose protection our trading vessels are intrusted , can not appear superfluous to any of your lordships , who have read the lists of our losses , heard the complaints of our merchants , or made any inquiry into the conduct of our sea captains .
There is , I fear , too much reason to believe , that some of them have , with premeditated design , deserted the traders in places where they have known them most exposed to the incursions of the enemy  and it is to the last degree evident , that others have manifested such contempt of the merchants , and such a disregard of their interest , as may most justly expose them to the suspicion of very criminal negligence , of negligence which no community can be too watchful against , or too severely punish .


It has been affirmed by the noble lord , that it is not equitable to subject the commanders of convoys to penalties for the loss of the trading vessels , which may , perhaps , either rashly or negligently quit their protection .
That it is not reasonable to subject them to penalties , is undoubtedly true  but , my lords , it is far from being equally certain , that it is not just to expose them to a trial , in a case in which it must be almost impossible to determine falsely  in a case where the crews of , perhaps , twenty ships may be called as witnesses of their conduct , and where none , but those whose ship is lost , can be under the least temptation to offer a false testimony against them .


On this occasion , my lords , it may not be improper to obviate the objection produced by the seeming omission of penal sanctions , which is only another proof of implicit confidence in the officers of the admiralty , who have already the power , allowed to military courts , of proceeding against those who shall deviate from their orders .
This power , which is in a great degree discretionary , it was thought improper to limit , by ascertaining the punishment of crimes , which so many circumstances may aggravate or diminish  and , therefore , in my opinion , this clause is far from being so defective as the noble lord represented it .


The last three clauses , by which the ships in America are prohibited to leave their station , by which it is required that accounts should be once in six months transmitted to the admiralty , and by which the captains are subjected to the command of the governours of our colonies , are , in my opinion , justly to be censured .
The first is impossible to be observed , the second is unnecessary , and the third will probably produce more inconveniencies than benefits .


Thus , my lords , I have endeavoured to show , that this bill , though not perfect , is yet such as , with some emendations , may produce great advantages to the traders of this empire .
For , though it is undoubtedly a just observation , that the success of military attempts can not be promoted by rigid restrictions and minute regulations , yet it is equally certain that no nation has yet been so fortunate as to be served by men of integrity superiour to laws , or of wisdom superiour to instructions  and every government has found it necessary to direct the conduct of its officers by general rules , though they have been allowed to comply with particular circumstances , and to give way to sudden accidents .


I think it , therefore , my lords , necessary to propose , that this bill shall be more particularly examined in a committee , that , after having received the necessary explanations and amendments , it may be referred again to the other house .


Lord DELAWARE rose next , and spoke to the purpose following : -- My lords , the noble duke has , by his arguments in favour of this bill , given a very eminent proof of great abilities  he has shown every clause in that light which may least expose to view its improprieties and defects  but has at length only shown , that it is not impossible to make a useful law , for the purposes mentioned in the title of this bill  not that any of the expedients , now proposed , will afford the desired advantage to the publick , or obviate any of the inconveniencies of which the traders have been so long and so importunately complaining .


This bill , my lords , is , indeed , founded upon a law made in a reign celebrated for the wisdom of our conduct and the success of our arms  but it will not , I suppose , be asserted , that nothing was , even in that period , ill conducted  nor will it be an argument , sufficient for the justification of an expedient , that it was practised in the victorious reign of queen Anne .


If we inquire into the consequences of that law , we shall find no inducement to revive it on this or any future occasion .
For it had no other effect than that of exposing us to our enemies by dividing our forces  a disadvantage of which we soon found the effects , by the loss of two large ships of seventy guns , and of a multitude of trading vessels , which , by that diminution of our naval armament , necessarily fell into the hands of privateers and small cruisers , that ravaged the ocean without fear or molestation .


If we examine the present establishment of our navy , my lords , it will be discovered , that nothing is proposed in this bill , which is not more efficaciously performed by the methods now in use , and more judiciously established by laws , of which long experience has shown the usefulness .
This , my lords , will easily appear from the perusal of the orders which every commander of a convoy regularly receives , and of the printed rules , established by his majesty in council , for the royal navy .


In these , my lords , much more is comprehended than can properly be inferred in a law not occasionally variable  nor do I think any thing omitted , which an experienced and candid inquirer will think useful to the increase of our naval strength , or necessary to the protection of our commerce .


In considering this bill , I shall not trouble your lordships with a minute consideration of every single paragraph , though every paragraph might furnish opportunity for animadversions  but shall content myself with endeavouring to evince the reasonableness of some of the objections made by the noble lord who spoke first , and enforcing his opinion with such arguments as have occurred to me , though , indeed , it requires no uncommon sagacity to discover , or superiour skill in ratiocination to prove , that where this bill will produce any alteration in our present scheme , it will manifestly change it for the worse .


For surely , my lords , it will not be necessary to show , by any elaborate and refined reasoning , the absurdity of confining cruisers to particular stations , with an absolute prohibition to depart from them , whatever may be the certainty of destruction , or prospect of advantage .


If the intention of cruising ships is to annoy the enemies of the nation , ought they to be deprived of the liberty of pursuing them ?
If they are designed for the protection of our merchants , must they not be allowed to attend them till they are out of danger .


Every one , my lords , has had opportunities of observing , that there are men who are wholly engrossed by the present moment , and who , if they can procure immoderate profit , or escape any impending danger , are without the least solicitude with regard to futurity , and who , therefore , live only by the hour , without any general scheme of conduct , or solid foundation of lasting happiness , and who , consequently , are for ever obliged to vary their measures , and obviate every new accident by some new contrivance .


By men of this disposition , my lords , a temper by which they are certainly very little qualified for legislators , the bill now before us seems to have been drawn up  for their attention is evidently so engaged by the present occurrences , that there is no place left for any regard to distant contingencies .
The conclusion of this war is to them the period of human existence , the end of all discord and all policy .
They consider Spain as the only enemy with whom we can ever be at variance , and have , therefore , drawn up a law , a law without any limitation of time , to enable us to oppose her .
They have with great industry and long searches discovered , that cruisers on this side cape Finisterre , may be of use against the Spaniards , and propose , therefore , that in all times of war they are to be despatched to that individual station , though we should be engaged in disputes with the northern crowns , or fit out fleets to make conquests in the East Indies .


In all our wars , my lords , however judiciously concerted , and however happily concluded , the pleasures of success have been abated by the mortification of losses , and some complaints have been at all times mingled with the shouts of triumph .
How much soever the glory of the nation has been elevated , the fortunes of particular persons have been impaired , and those have never thought themselves recompensed by the general advantages of the publick , who have suffered by the acquisition of them  they have always imagined themselves marked out for ruin by malevolence and resentment , and have concluded that those disasters which fell upon them only by the common chance of war , were brought on them by negligence or design .


The losses of our merchants in the present war must be acknowledged to have been more than common , but if we examine accurately into the causes that may be assigned for so great a number of captures , we shall find them such as this law will have no tendency to remove , such as might be easily imagined before the commencement of hostilities , and such as it will be extremely difficult on any future occasion of the same kind , to hinder from producing the same effects .


The first and greatest cause , my lords , of the number of our losses , is the number of our ships , which can not all be sufficiently protected .
The extent , therefore , of our commerce , in proportion to that of our enemies , exposes us to double disadvantage  we necessarily lie open in more parts to the depredations of privateers , and have no encouragement to attempt reprisals , because they have few ships of value to be seized .
The profit of our commerce naturally withholds our sailors from our ships of war , and makes part of our navy an idle show  the certainty of plunder incites them to turn their merchant ships into cruisers , and to suspend their trade for more profitable employment .
Thus they at once increase the number of plunderers , and take away from us the opportunity of repairing our losses by the same practice .


And , my lords , if the losses of our merchants have been greater than in former wars , our trade is more extensive , and our ships far more numerous .
Nor is it to be forgotten that a very important part of our commerce is carried on before the eyes of the Spaniards , so that they may issue out upon our merchants from their own coasts , and retire immediately beyond danger of pursuit .


But , my lords , neither the situation of Spain , nor the extent of our commerce , would have made this war so destructive , had not our merchants sometimes facilitated the attempts of our enemies by their own negligence or avarice .


I have been informed , my lords , that as the masters of trading vessels complain of having been deserted by their convoys , the captains of the ships of war have , in their turn , exhibited such representations of the conduct of the trading masters , as may prove that their caution is not proportioned to their clamour , and that in however melancholy terms they may recount the miseries of captivity , the calamities of ruined families , and the interruption of the trade of Britain , they will not endeavour to escape their enemies at the expense of much circumspection , and that the prospect of no large profit will be sufficient to overbalance the danger of those evils which they so pathetically lament .


It is not uncommon , my lords , when the fleet has entered the open seas , for the traders to take different courses both from the convoy and from each other , and to disperse themselves beyond the possibility of receiving assistance in danger or distress  and what wonder is it if part of them be lost , since only part of them can be protected ?


It may be imagined , my lords , that this is only an excuse forged by the commanders to cover their own negligence or treachery .
It may be asked , what motives could induce the merchants to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers , or what proofs they have ever given of such wild negligence of their own interest or safety , as that they should be suspected of rushing precipitately into the jaws of rapine ?


This , my lords , is an objection specious in itself , and such as those who have not inquired into the present state of our traffick will not very readily discover to be fallacious  but it may easily be removed , by showing that the danger of being taken by the enemy is generally not so great to those who have the direction of the ship as it is commonly believed .


By the present custom of insurance , my lords , the merchant exempts himself from the hazard of great losses , and if he insures so much of the value of the ship and cargo , that the chance of arriving first at market is equivalent to the remaining part , what shall hinder him from pressing forward at all events , and directing his course intrepidly through seas crowded with enemies ?


It is well known , my lords , that there is , in a great part of mankind , a secret malignity , which makes one unwilling to contribute to the advantage of another , even when his own interest will suffer no diminution  nor is it to be imagined , that this disposition is less predominant in traders than in the other classes of the community , though it is exerted on different occasions .
The envy of one part of mankind is excited by reputation , or interest , or dignity , or power .
The trader , for the most part , envies nothing but money , in which he has been taught from his infancy that every human excellence is comprehended , and contributes to the increase of the riches of another , with the same unwillingness with which a soldier would concur in the advancement of an inferiour officer to a post of higher rank and authority than his own .


For this reason , my lords , there is generally a malevolence in the merchant against the insurer , whom he considers as an idle caterpillar , living without industry upon the labours of others , and , therefore , when he lays down the sum stipulated for security , he is almost in suspense , whether he should not prefer the loss of the remaining part of the value of his vessel to the mortification of seeing the insurer enjoy that money , which fear and caution have influenced him to pay .


This disposition , undoubtedly , inclines him to proceed with less regard to his own security , and betrays him into dangers which it was , at least , possible to avoid  for to what purpose , says he , have I insured my ship if I am not to be set free from the necessity of anxiety and caution ?
If I arrive safely at the port , I shall dispose of my commodities with uncommon advantage  if I miscarry , the insurer will at least suffer with me , and be deservedly punished for his suspicions and extortion .


I doubt not but some of your lordships will imagine , that I am now indulging chimerical speculations , that I am ascribing great force to weak motives , and supposing men to act upon principles which , in reality , never operated in the human breast .
When I think disadvantageously of others , my lords , I am , indeed , always desirous to find myself mistaken , and shall be pleased to hear on this occasion from any of your lordships , who have conversed at large among mankind , that it is not common for one man to neglect his own interest for fear of promoting that of another .
In the present question , my lords , I have only supposed that envy may be one motive among many , and wish its influence were so small , as that it might have been less proper to mention it .


The practice of insurance , my lords , whether it contributes or not to the number of the captures , undoubtedly increases the clamour which they occasion  for as the loss is extended , the complaint is multiplied , and both the merchant and insurer take the liberty of censuring the conduct of the naval officers , and of condemning the measures of the government .
The ministry is charged with neglecting the protection of commerce , with oppressing the merchants , and with conniving at the enemy 's preparations  that they who most eagerly solicited the war , may be the first that shall repent it .


Another cause of the frequency of our losses in the present war , is the general circulation of intelligence throughout Europe , by which it is made impossible to conceal from our enemies the state of our armies , our navies , or our trade .
Every regiment that is raised , every ship that is built , every fleet of trading vessels that lies waiting for the wind , is minutely registered in the papers of the week , and accounts of it transmitted to every nation of the world , where curiosity or interest will pay for information .
The Spaniards , therefore , need only regulate their schemes according to their instructions from Britain , and watch those fleets which are frequently sent out , for they may be confident that some masters will wander from their protectors , enticed by avarice , negligence , or temerity , and that they shall have opportunities of enriching themselves without the necessity of engaging the convoy .


To protect ships which are to be steered each at the will of the master , is no less impossible , my lords , than to conduct an army of which every private man is at liberty to march according to his own caprice , to form and pursue his own plan of operation , and to dispute and neglect the orders of his leader .
Nor is it more reasonable to subject the captains of the ships of war to penalties for the loss of a vessel , over which they have no authority , than to require from an officer in the army an account of the lives of men , who perished by disobeying his commands .


In my opinion , my lords , we might , with far greater probability of success , revive a precedent that may be found in the reign of king William , in which it was appointed by an order of council , that the name of every ship which went out with a convoy should be registered , and that the owners should give security to provide a sufficient number of arms and a proper quantity of ammunition to assist the imperial ships in annoying or repelling the enemy  with one injunction more of the utmost importance to the efficacious protection of our commerce , and which , therefore , in every war ought to be repeated and enforced  an injunction by which the masters of the ships of trade were required to obey the directions of the commander of the convoy .


That some measures ought to be concerted for the preservation of our trade I am very far from denying , and shall willingly concur in such as shall to me appear likely to promote the end proposed by them .
Our losses , my lords , are undoubtedly great , though I believe far less than they are reported by discontent and malevolence  for if a ship be delayed by an accidental hinderance , or kept back by contrary winds for a few days , there are men so watchful to snatch every opportunity of reproaching the measures of the government , that a clamour is immediately raised , the ship is taken , the merchants are sacrificed , and the nation betrayed .


While this report is conveyed from one to another , and , like other falsehoods , increasing in its progress  while every man adds some circumstance of exaggeration , or some new proof of the treachery of the ministry , the ship enters the port , and puts an end , indeed , to the anxiety of the owners and insurers , but by no means pacifies the people , or removes their prejudices against the conduct of their governours  for as no man acknowledges himself the first author of the report , no man thinks himself under any obligation to retract or confute it , and the passions of the multitude , being once in commotion , can not be calmed before another opportunity of the same kind may be offered for agitating them afresh .


To the expectations of the people , my lords , it is always proper to have some regard , nor is there any valuable use of power but that of promoting happiness , and preventing or removing calamities  but we are not to endeavour to pacify them by the appearance of redress , which , in reality , will only increase those evils of which they complain , nor to depress the reputation of this assembly by passing laws which the experience of a single month will prove to be of no use .


Of this kind , my lords , the bill now before us has been shown by the noble lord that spoke first on this occasion  by whom every clause has been discovered to be either defective or unnecessary , and who has evinced , beyond all possibility of reply , that the regulations here proposed can be divided only into two kinds , of which one is already established either by law or prescription , and the other can not be admitted without apparent injury both to our navy and our trade .


Part of the clauses the noble duke has , indeed , attempted to defend , but has been obliged by his regard to reason and to truth , to make such concessions , as are , in my opinion , sufficient arguments for the rejection of the bill .
He has admitted of almost every clause that it is imperfect , that it may be amended by farther consideration , and that , though not wholly to be neglected , it yet requires some farther improvements to become effectual to the advantage of our merchants .


The last three clauses , his natural abilities and just discernment immediately showed him to be indefensible  and he has too much regard to the interest of his country to attempt the vindication of a bill , which could not be passed without weakening it by impairing its naval force , and , yet more sensibly , by diminishing the reputation of its legislature .


I hope , therefore , my lords , that I shall not undergo the common censure of disregard to our commercial interest , or be ranked amongst the enemies of the merchants , though I declare , that in my opinion , this bill ought to be rejected as unnecessary and injudicious , and that we should only , by considering in a committee what no consideration can amend , waste that time in a fruitless attempt , which may be spent much more usefully upon other subjects .


Lord CARTERET spoke next , to the following purpose : -- My lords , though I do not approve equally of every part of the bill now before us , though I think some of the provisions unnecessary , others unlikely to produce any beneficial effects , and some already established by former acts of the senate , or rules of the admiralty , yet I can not agree with the noble lord that it is unworthy of farther consideration .


In my opinion , my lords , it is necessary , for many reasons , to amend this bill rather than reject it  and I hope , that when I shall have laid before you the result of those inquiries and those reflections which I have made on this occasion , your lordships will judge it not improper to refer it to a committee .


Nothing , my lords , is more necessary to the legislature than the affection and esteem of the people  all government consists in the authority of the few over the many , and authority , therefore , can be founded only on opinion , and must always fall to the ground , when that which supports it is taken away .


For this reason , my lords , it is worthy of this most august and awful assembly , to endeavour to convince the people of our solicitude for their happiness , and our compassion for their sufferings  lest we should seem elevated by the casual advantages of birth and fortune above regard to the lower classes of mankind  lest we should seem exalted above others only to neglect them , and invested with power only to exert it in acts of wanton oppression  lest high rank should in time produce hatred rather than reverence , and superiority of fortune only tempt rapine and excite rebellion .


The bill now under our consideration , my lords , can not be rejected without danger of exasperating the nation , without affording to the discontented and malevolent an opportunity of representing this house as regardless of the publick miseries , and deaf to the cries of our fellow-subjects languishing in captivity , and mourning in poverty .
The melancholy and dejected will naturally conceive us inebriated with affluence , and elated with dignity , endeavouring to remove from our eyes every spectacle of misery , and to turn aside from those lamentations which may interrupt the enjoyment of our felicity .


Nor , indeed , can it be justly said , that such representations are without grounds , when we consider the important occasion on which this bill is drawn up , the bitterness of those calamities which it is intended to redress , and the authority by which it is recommended to us .


It may naturally be expected , my lords , that the title of a bill for the protection and security of trade , should raise an uncommon degree of ardour and attention  it might be conceived that every lord in this house would be ambitious of signalizing his zeal for the interest of his country , by proposing , on this occasion , every expedient which experience or information had suggested to him  and that instead of setting ourselves free from the labour of inquiry and the anxiety of deliberation , by raising objections to the bill and rejecting it , we should labour with unanimous endeavours , and incessant assiduity , to supply its defects , and correct its improprieties  to show that a design so beneficial can never be proposed to us without effect , and that whenever we find honest zeal , we shall be ready to assist it with judgment and experience .


Compassion might likewise concur to invigorate our endeavours on this occasion .
For who , my lords , can reflect on families one day flourishing in affluence , and contributing to the general prosperity of their country , and on a sudden , without the crime of extravagance or negligence , reduced to penury and distress , harassed by creditors , and plundered by the vultures of the law , without wishing that such misfortunes might by some expedient be averted ?
But this , my lords , is not the only nor the greatest calamity , which this bill is intended to prevent .
The loss of wealth , however grievous , is yet less to be dreaded than that of liberty , and indigence added to captivity is the highest degree of human misery .
Yet even this , however dreadful , is now the lot of multitudes of our fellow-subjects , who are languishing with want in the prisons of Spain .


Surely , my lords , every proposal must be well received that intends the prevention or relief of calamities like these .
Surely the ruin of its merchants must alarm every trading nation , nor can a British senate sit unconcerned at the captivity of those men by whom liberty is chiefly supported .


Of the importance of the merchants , by whom this bill is recommended to our consideration , and by whose influence it has already passed the other house , it is not necessary to remind your lordships , who know , that to this class of men our nation is indebted for all the advantages that it possesses above those which we behold with compassion or contempt , for its wealth and power , and perhaps for its liberty and civility .
To the merchants , my lords , we owe that our name is known beyond our own coasts , and that our influence is not confined to the narrow limits of a single island .


Let us not , therefore , my lords , reject with contempt what is proposed and solicited by men of this class  men whose experience and knowledge can not but have enabled them to offer something useful and important , though , perhaps , for want of acquaintance with former laws , they may have imagined those provisions now first suggested , which have only been forgotten , and petitioned for the enaction of a new law , when they needed only an enforcement of former statutes .


That our naval force has , in the present war , been misapplied  that our commerce has been exposed to petty spoilers , in a degree never known before  that our convoys have been far from adding security to our traders  and that with the most powerful fleet in the world , we have suffered all that can fall upon the most defenceless nation , can not be denied .


Nor is it any degree of temerity , my lords , to affirm , that these misfortunes have been brought upon us by either negligence or treachery  for , besides that no other cause can be assigned for the losses which a powerful people suffer from an enemy of inferiour force , there is the strongest authority for asserting , that our maritime affairs have been ill conducted , and that , therefore , the regulation of them is very seasonably and properly solicited by the merchants .


For this assertion , my lords , we may produce the authority of the other house , by which a remonstrance was drawn up against the conduct of the commissioners of the admiralty .
This alone ought to influence us to an accurate discussion of this affair .
But when an authority yet more venerable is produced , when it appears that his majesty , by the dismission of the commissioners from their employments , admitted the justice of the representation of the commons , it surely can be of no use to evince , by arguments , the necessity of new regulations .


It is , indeed , certain , that men of integrity and prudence , men of ability to discern their duty , and of resolution to execute it , can receive very little assistance from rules and prescriptions  nor can I deny what the noble lord has affirmed , that they may be sometimes embarrassed in their measures , and hindered from snatching opportunities of success , and complying with emergent occasions  but , my lords , we are to consider mankind , not as we wish them , but as we find them , frequently corrupt , and always fallible .


If men were all honest and wise , laws of all kinds would be superfluous , a legislature would become useless , and our authority must cease for want of objects to employ it  but we find , my lords , that there are men whom nothing but laws and penalties can make supportable to society  that there are men , who , if they are not told their duty , will never know it , and who will , at last , only perform what they shall be punished for neglecting .


Were all men , like the noble lord whom I am now attempting to answer , vigilant to discover , sagacious to distinguish , and industrious to prosecute the interest of the publick , I should be very far from proposing that they should be constrained by rules , or required to follow any guide but their own reason  I should resign my own prosperity , and that of my country , implicitly into their hands , and rest in full security that nothing would be omitted that human wisdom could dictate for our advantage .


I am not persuading your lordships to lay restraints upon virtue and prudence , but to consider how seldom virtue and authority are found together , how often prudence degenerates into selfishness , and all generous regard for the publick is contracted into narrow views of private interest .
I am endeavouring to show , that since laws must be equally obligatory to all , it is the interest of the few good men to submit to restraints , which , though they may sometimes obstruct the influence of their virtue , will abundantly recompense them , by securing them from the mischiefs that wickedness , reigning almost without limits , and operating without opposition , might bring upon them .


It may not be improper to add , my lords , that no degree of human wisdom is exempt from errour  that he who claims the privilege of acting at discretion , subjects himself likewise to the necessity of answering for the consequences of his conduct , and that ill success will at least subject him to reproach and suspicion , from which , he whose conduct is regulated by established rules , may always have an opportunity of setting himself free .


Fixed and certain regulations are , therefore , my lords , useful to the wisest and best men  and to those whose abilities are less conspicuous , and whose integrity is at best doubtful , I suppose it will not be doubted that they are indispensably necessary .


Some of the expedients mentioned in this bill , I shall readily concur with the noble lord in censuring and rejecting  I am very far from thinking it expedient to invest the governours of our colonies with any new degree of power , or to subject the captains of our ships of war to their command .
I have lived , my lords , to see many successions of those petty monarchs , and have known few whom I would willingly trust with the exercise of great authority .
It is not uncommon , my lords , for those to be made cruel and capricious by power , who were moderate and prudent in lower stations  and if the effects of exaltation are to be feared even in good men , what may not be expected from it in those , whom nothing but a distant employment could secure from the laws , and who , if they had not been sent to America to govern , must probably have gone thither on a different occasion ?


The noble duke , who has vindicated the bill with arguments to which very little can be added , and to which I believe nothing can be replied , has expressed his unwillingness to concur in any measures for the execution of which new officers must be appointed .
An increase of officers , my lords , is , indeed , a dreadful sound , a sound that can not but forebode the ruin of our country  the number of officers already established is abundantly sufficient for all useful purposes , nor can any addition be made but to the ruin of our constitution .


I am , therefore , of opinion , that no new officer was intended by those that drew up the bill , and that they proposed only to furnish those that loiter in our ports , at the expense of the publick , with an opportunity of earning their salaries by some useful employment .


I know not , indeed , my lords , whether any good effects can be reasonably hoped from this provision  whether men accustomed to connivance and negligence in affairs of less importance , ought to be trusted with the care of our naval preparations , and engaged in service , on which the prosperity of the publick may depend  and can not conceal my apprehensions , that such men , if commissioned to superintend others , may themselves require a superintendent .


But , my lords , this and every other clause may , in a committee , be carefully examined and deliberately corrected  and since it appears evident to me , that some law is necessary for the security of our commerce , I think this bill ought not to be rejected without farther consideration .


Lord WINCHELSEA rose again , and spoke thus : -- My lords , as the known sincerity of that noble lord allows no room for suspecting , that he would bestow any praises where he did not believe there was some desert , and as his penetration and acuteness secure him from being deceived by any false appearances of merit , I can not but applaud myself for having obtained his esteem , which I hope will not be forfeited by my future conduct .


Having happily gained the regard of so exact a judge of mankind , I am the less solicitous what opinion may be conceived of my abilities or intentions by those whose censures I less fear , and whose praises I less value , and shall , therefore , cheerfully hazard any degree of popularity , which I may have hitherto possessed , by continuing my opposition to this bill , of which I am still convinced that it will produce nothing but embarrassment , losses , and disgrace .


The necessity of gaining and preserving the esteem of the people I very willingly allow , but am of opinion that though it may sometimes be gained by flattering their passions and complying with their importunities , by false appearances of relief , and momentary alleviations of their grievances , it is only to be preserved by real and permanent benefits , by a steady attention to the great ends of government , and a vigorous prosecution of the means by which they may be obtained , without regard to present prejudices or temporary clamours .


I believe , my lords , it will always be found that it is dangerous to gratify the people at their own expense , and to sacrifice their interest to their caprices  for I have so high a veneration of their wisdom , as to pronounce without scruple , that however they may , for a time , be deceived by artful misrepresentations , they will , at length , learn to esteem those most , who have the resolution to promote their happiness in opposition to their prejudices .


I am , therefore , confident , my lords , of regaining the popularity which I may lose by declaring , once more , that this bill ought to be rejected , since no endeavours shall be wanting to show how little it is necessary , by an effectual protection of every part of our trade , and a diligent provision for the naval service .


The duke of BEDFORD rose , and spoke to this effect : -- My lords , I am convinced that this bill is very far from being either absurd or useless , nor can imagine that they by whom it was drawn up could fail of producing some expedients that may deserve consideration .


It is probable , that a farther inquiry may show the propriety of some clauses , which at present appear most liable to censure  and that , if we reject this bill thus precipitately , we shall condemn what we do not fully comprehend .
No clause appeared to me more unworthy of the judgment and penetration of the merchants than the last , nor was there any which I should have rejected at the first perusal with less regret  yet , having taken this opportunity of considering it a second time , I find it by no means indefensible , for the direction of ships stationed for the defence of our American territories , is not committed to the governours alone .
The council of each province is joined with them in authority , by whom any private regards may be overborne , and who can not be supposed to concur in any directions which will not promote the general interest of the colony .


I doubt not , my lords , but other clauses have been equally mistaken , and , therefore , think it necessary to consider them in a committee , where every lord may declare his sentiments , without the restraint of a formal debate , and where the bill may be deliberately revised , and accommodated more exactly to the present exigencies of the nation .


Lord WINCHELSEA spoke again , in substance as follows : -- My lords , the only reason which has been urged for considering this bill in a committee , is the necessity of gratifying the merchants , and of showing our concern for the prosperity of commerce .
If therefore it shall appear , that the merchants are indifferent with regard to its success , I hope it will be rejected without opposition .


I was this morning , my lords , informed by a merchant , who has many opportunities of acquainting himself with the opinions of the trading part of the nation , that they were fully convinced of the impossibility of adapting fixed rules to variable exigencies , or of establishing any certain method of obviating the chances of war , and defeating enemies who were every day altering their schemes  and declared that they had no hopes of security but from the vigilance of a board of admiralty , solicitous for the welfare of the merchants , and the honour of the nation .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY rose and spoke to the following purpose : -- My lords , as three clauses of this bill have been universally given up , and almost all the rest plainly proved by the noble lord to be either absurd or superfluous , I can not see why it should not be rejected without the solemnity of farther consideration , to which , indeed , nothing but the title can give it any claim .


The title , my lords , is , indeed , specious , and well fitted to the design of gaining attention and promoting popularity  but with this title there is nothing that corresponds , nor is any thing to be found but confusion and contradictions , which grow more numerous upon farther search .


That the whole bill , my lords , is unnecessary , can not be denied , if it be considered that nothing is proposed in it which is not already in the power of your lordships , who may call at pleasure for the lists of the navy , the accounts of the cruisers , the duties of their commissions , and the journals of their commanders , ( as you did in the sixth of queen Anne , ) and detect every act of negligence or treachery , and every instance of desertion , or of cowardice .


Nothing is necessary to the regulation of our naval force , but that your lordships vigilantly exert that power which is conferred upon you by the constitution , and examine the conduct of every officer with attention and impartiality  no man then will dare to neglect his duty , because no man can hope to escape punishment .


Of this bill , therefore , since it is thus useless and inconsistent , I can not but suspect , my lords , that it was concerted for purposes very different from those mentioned in the title , which it has , indeed , no tendency to promote .
I believe , my lords , the projectors of it intended not so much to advance the interest of the merchants , as to depress the reputation of those whom they have long taken every opportunity of loading with reproaches , whom they have censured as the enemies of trade , the corrupters of the nation , and the confederates of Spain .


To confirm these general calumnies , it was necessary to fix on some particular accusation which might raise the resentment of the people , and exasperate them beyond reflection or inquiry .
For this purpose nothing was more proper than to charge them with betraying our merchants to the enemy .


As no accusation could be more efficacious to inflame the people , so none , my lords , could with more difficulty be confuted .
Some losses must be suffered in every war , and every one will necessarily produce complaints and discontent  every man is willing to blame some other person for his misfortunes , and it was , therefore , easy to turn the clamours of those whose vessels fell into the hands of the Spaniards , against the ministers and commanders of the ships of war .


These cries were naturally heard with the regard always paid to misfortune and distress , and propagated with zeal , because they were heard with pity .
Thus in time , what was at first only the outcry of impatience , was by malicious artifices improved into settled opinion , that opinion was diligently diffused , and all the losses of the merchants were imputed , not to the chance of war , but the treachery of the ministry .


But , my lords , the folly of this opinion , however general , and the falsehood of this accusation , however vehement , will become sufficiently apparent , if you examine that bulky collection of papers which are now laid before you , from which you will discover the number of our fleets , the frequency of our convoys , the stations of our ships of war , and the times of their departure and return  you will find that no provision for war , no expedient likely to promote success has been neglected  that we have now more ships equipped than in the late war with France , that nothing can be added to the exactness with which our maritime force is regulated , and that there is not the least reason to doubt of the fidelity with which it has been employed .


In every war , my lords , it is to be expected that losses will be suffered by private persons on each side , nor even in a successful war can the publick always hope to be enriched  because the advantage may arise , not immediately from captures , but , consequently , from the treaties or conditions in which a prosperous war may be supposed to terminate .


What concessions we shall in this war extort from the Spaniards , what security will be procured for our merchants , what recompense will be yielded for our losses , or what extent will be added to our commerce , it can not yet be expected that any man should be able to declare  nor will his majesty 's counsellors be required to give an account of futurity .
It is a sufficient vindication of their conduct , and an evident proof of the wisdom with which the war has been conducted , that we have hitherto gained more than we have lost .


This , my lords , will appear from a diligent and minute comparison of the captures on each side , and an exact computation of the value of our losses and our prizes .
It will be found that if the Spaniards have taken , as it is not improbable , a greater number of ships , those which they have lost have been far more wealthy .


The merchants , indeed , seem to have distrusted the strength of the evidence which they produced in support of their allegations , by bringing it only before the other house , where , as an oath could not be administered , every man delivered what he believed as what he knew , and indulged himself without scruple in venting his resentment , or declaring his suspicions  a method of allegation very proper to scatter reproaches and gratify malevolence , but of very little use for the discovery of truth .


Had they come before your lordships , every circumstance had been minutely examined , every assertion compared with other evidence , all exaggerations repressed , and all foreign considerations rejected  each part would have been impartially heard , and it would have plainly been known to whom every loss was to be imputed .
The negligence or treachery of the commanders of the convoys , wherever it had been found , would have been punished , but they would not have charged them with those miscarriages which were produced only by the obstinacy or inattention of the masters of the trading vessels .


Such inquiries , my lords , they appear to have thought it their interest to decline , and , therefore , did not proceed on their petition to this house  and if they did in reality avoid a rigorous examination , what can be inferred , but that they intended rather to offer insinuations than proofs , and rather to scatter infamy than obtain justice .


And , that nothing was indeed omitted that could secure our own commerce , or distress our enemies , may reasonably be collected from the number and great strength of our fleet , to which no empire in the world can oppose an equal force .
If it has not been supplied with sailors without some delays , and if these delays have given our enemies an opportunity of adding to their securities , of fortifying their ports , and supplying their magazines , it must be ascribed to the nature of our constitution , that forbids all compulsory methods of augmenting our forces , which must be considered as , perhaps , the only inconvenience to be thrown into the balance against the blessings of liberty .


The difficulty of manning our ships of war , is , indeed , extremely perplexing .
Men are naturally very little inclined to subject themselves to absolute command , or to engage in any service without a time limited for their dismission .
Men can not willingly rush into danger without the prospect of a large advantage  they have generally some fondness for their present state of life , and do not quit it without reluctance .
All these reasons , my lords , concur to withhold the sailors from the navy , in which they are necessarily governed with higher authority than in trading vessels , in which they are subjected to punishments , and confined by strict regulations , without any certain term of their bondage  for such they , who know not the necessity of subordination , nor discover the advantages of discipline , can not but account subjection to the will and orders of another .


By serving the merchants , they not only secure to themselves the liberty of changing their masters at pleasure , but enjoy the prospect of a near and certain advantage  they have not , indeed , any expectations of being suddenly enriched by a plate ship , and of gaining by one engagement such wealth as will enable them to spend the rest of their lives in ease and affluence  but they are sure of a speedy payment of their wages , perhaps , of some profits from petty commerce , and of an opportunity of squandering them at land in jollity and diversions  their labour is cheerful , because they know it will be short , and they readily enter into an employment which they can quit when it shall no longer please them .


These considerations , my lords , have no influence upon the preparations of France and Spain , where no man is master of his own fortune , or time , or life , and where the officers of the state can drive multitudes into the service of the crown , without regard to their private views , inclinations , or engagements .
To man a fleet , nothing is necessary but to lay an embargo on the trading vessels , and suspend their commerce for a short time  therefore no man dares refuse to enter into the publick service when he is summoned  nor , if he should fly , as our sailors , from an impress , would any man venture to shelter or conceal him .


Absolute monarchs have , therefore , this advantage over us , that they can be sooner prepared for war , and to this must be ascribed all the success which the Spaniards have obtained .
This , my lords , will not be obviated by the bill now before us , nor will it , indeed , procure any other benefit to the trade , or any addition to the power of the nation .


Of the ten clauses comprised in the bill , the greatest part is universally allowed to be injudiciously and erroneously proposed  and those few , which were thought of more importance , have been shown to contain no new expedients , nor to add any thing to the present regulations .


I can not , therefore , discover any reason , my lords , that should induce us to refer to a committee this bill , of which part is confessedly to be rejected , and the rest is apparently superfluous .


[ Then the question being put , whether the bill should be referred to a committee  it passed in the negative .
Content , 25 .
Not content , 59 .


On the rejection of this bill by the lords , a bill which related to an affair of no less importance than the security of trade and navigation , and which had been unanimously passed by the commons , it was satirically remarked , that the upper house understood trade and navigation better than the lower .
However , the circumstances that attended it , made the publication of the bill , with the amendments and the reasons offered by the lords on both sides , expected with the more impatience . ]


HOUSE OF LORDS , NOVEMBER 16 , 1742 .


Parliament having met , according to the royal summons , on this day , his majesty made a speech from the throne , which being afterwards read by the president , lord TWEEDALE rose , and spoke as follows :


My lords , it is not without the highest satisfaction , that every lover of mankind must look upon the alterations that have lately been produced in the state of Europe  nor can any Briton forbear to express an immediate and particular pleasure to observe his country rising again into its former dignity , to see his own nation shake off dependence , and rouse from inactivity , cover the ocean with her fleets , and awe the continent with her armies  bid , once more , defiance to the rapacious invaders of neighbouring kingdoms , and the daring projectors of universal dominion  once more exert her influence in foreign courts , and summon the monarchs of the west to another confederacy against the power of France .


The queen of Hungary , who was lately obliged to retire at the approach of her enemies , to leave her capital in danger of a siege , and seek shelter in the remotest corner of her dominions , who was lately so harassed with invasions , and so encircled with dangers , that she could scarcely fly from one ravager , without the hazard of falling into the hands of another , is now able to give laws to her persecutors , to return the violence which she has suffered , and instead of imploring mercy from those who had no regard but to their own interest , and were determined to annihilate her family and divide her dominions , now sits in full security on her throne , directs the march of distant armies , and dictates the terms on which those who have entered her dominions shall be suffered to escape .


Such , my lords , is the present state of the German empire  nor have the affairs of the rest of Europe been less changed  the power of the house of Bourbon has been diminished on every side , its alliance has been rejected , and its influence disregarded .


The king of Sardinia has openly engaged to hinder the Spaniards from erecting a new kingdom in Italy  and though he has hitherto been somewhat embarrassed in his measures , and oppressed by the superiority of his enemies , has at least , by preventing the conjunction of the Spanish armies , preserved the Austrians from being overwhelmed .
Nor can the situation of his dominions , and the number of his forces , suffer us to doubt , that in a short time he will be able entirely to secure Italy , since he has already recovered his country , and drove back the Spaniards into the bosom of France .


The condition of the other Spanish army is such , as no enemy can wish to be aggravated by new calamities .
They are shut up in a country without provisions , or of which the inhabitants are unwilling to supply them : on one side are neutral states , to which the law of nations bars their entrance  on another the Mediterranean sea , which can afford them only the melancholy prospect of hostile armaments , or sometimes of their own ships falling into the hands of the Britons  behind them are the troops of Austria ready to embarrass their march , intercept their convoys , and receive those whom famine and despair incite to change their masters , and to seek among foreign nations that ease and safety , of which the tyranny of their own government , and the madness of their own leaders , has deprived them .
Such is their distress , and so great their diminution , that a few months must complete their ruin , they must be destroyed without the honour of a battle , they must sink under the fatigue of hungry marches , by which no enemy is overtaken or escaped , and be at length devoured , by those diseases , which toil and penury will inevitably produce .


That the diminution of the influence of the house of Bourbon is not an empty opinion , which we easily receive , because we wish it to be true  that other nations , likewise , see the same events with the same sentiments , and prognosticate the decline of that power which has so long intimidated the universe , appears from the declaration now made by his majesty of the conduct of the Swedish court .


That nation which was lately governed by the counsels , and glutted with the bounties of France , which watched the nod of her mighty patroness , and made war at her command against the Russian empire , now begins to discover , that there are other powers more worthy of confidence and respect , more careful to observe their engagements , or more able to fulfil them .
She , therefore , requests the British monarch to extricate her from those difficulties , in which she is entangled by a blind compliance with French dictates , to restore to her the dismembered provinces , and recall that enemy which now impends over her capital , and whom the French have neither interest to appease , nor strength to resist .


Such , my lords , is the present prospect which offers itself to him who surveys Europe with a political view , and examines the present interest and dispositions of neighbouring potentates  such is the order which has been produced from general confusion , and such the reestablishment of equal power , which has succeeded these concussions of the world .


It is no small addition to the pleasure which this change must afford every man , who has either wisdom to discover his own happiness , or benevolence to rejoice in that of others , that it has been the effect not of chance but of conduct  that it is not an unforeseen event , produced by the secret operation of causes fortuitously concurring , but the result of a political and just design , well concerted and steadily pursued  that every advantage which has been gained , is the consequence of measures laid to obtain it  that our happiness has been procured by prudence , and that our counsels have not been lucky but wise .


If we reflect , my lords , upon the causes which have contributed to the rescue of Europe from impending slavery , which have reestablished the queen of Hungary in her dominions , enabled her to lay waste the territories of her invaders , confirmed her friends in their fidelity , and intimidated those whom rival interests inclined to wish her fall , or the hope of sharing in the plunder , had incited to form designs against her .
If we inquire to what it is to be ascribed , that she is able to form new alliances , and defend her dominions with confederate armies , we shall find it easy to trace all these revolutions to one cause , the steady and prudent conduct of the king of Britain .


Our sovereign , my lords , has looked on the troubles of Europe with that concern which publick virtue inspires  he has seen the sufferings of this illustrious princess with that compassion which is always due to magnanimity oppressed , and formed resolutions for her assistance with that ardour , which courage naturally kindles  but with that caution , likewise , and secrecy , which experience dictates .
But he remembered , my lords , that , though he was the friend of the queen of Hungary , he was to consider himself as the father of the people of Britain  that he was not to exhaust the forces of this nation in romantick expeditions , or exhaust its treasures in giving assistance which was not needed .


He therefore waited to observe the event of the war , and to discover whether the incessant struggles of the Austrians would be able to throw off the load with which they were oppressed  but he found that their spirit , however ardent , could not supply the want of strength  he found , that they were fainting under insuperable labours , and that , though they were in no danger of being conquered by the valour of their enemies , they must , in a short time , be wearied with their numbers .


His majesty then knew , my lords , that , by sending them speedy assistance , he at once promoted the interest of his people , and gratified his own inclinations  he therefore supplied the queen with such sums as enabled her to levy new forces , and drive her enemies before her .
By procuring a reconciliation with the king of Prussia , he freed her from the nearest and most formidable danger , and gave her an opportunity to secure herself against the menaces of other powers .


But though she was set free from domestick dangers , though invasion was driven from her capital , though captivity no longer pursued her flight , nor usurpation hovered over her throne , her more distant dominions were still a prey to her enemies .
The Spaniards had already landed one army in Italy , with which another was hastening to join .
The success of this enterprise , which would have gained the greatest part of Italy , could only be hindered by the king of Sardinia , who was , therefore , solicited by the Spaniards and French to favour their design , with the strongest protestations , and the most magnificent promises .
But these were overbalanced by the influence of the king of Britain , whose name was of sufficient importance to make the weaker part most eligible , and to counterbalance the force of immediate interest .


Thus was the passage into Italy barred against the Spaniards , by obstacles which they can never surmount , while the other army is besieged by our fleet , and by the Austrians  and reduced , instead of conquering kingdoms , to change their camp , and regulate their marches , with no other view than to avoid famine .
While that prince , whose dominions might most commodiously afford them succour , and whom all the ties of nature and of interest oblige to assist them , is awed by the British ships of war , which lie at anchor before his metropolis , and of which the commanders , upon the least suspicion of hostilities against the queen of Hungary , threaten to batter his palaces , and destroy his city .


In this manner , my lords , has the king of Britain assisted the house of Austria with his treasures , his influence , and his navy  thus does he subdue some enemies , and restrain others  thus does he hold the balance of the war , and thus does he add the weight of power to the scale of justice .


But to secure the success that has been already obtained , and to take from the enemies of liberty all hopes of recovering the advantages which they have lost , he has now no longer confined his assistance to negotiations and pecuniary supplies .
He knows that alliances are always best observed , when they confer security , or produce manifest advantages  and that money will not be always equivalent to armies .
He has , therefore , now acted openly in defence of his ally , has filled Flanders , once more , with British troops , and garrisoned the frontier towns with the forces of that nation by which they were gained .
The veteran now sees , once more , the plains over which he formerly pursued the squadrons of France , points the place where he seized the standards , or broke the lines , where he trampled the oppressors of mankind , with that spirit which is enkindled by liberty and justice .
His heart now beats , once more , at the sight of those walls which he formerly stormed , and he shows the wounds which he received in the mine , or on the breach .
The French now discover , that they are not yet lords of the continent  and that Britain has other armies ready to force , once more , the passes of Schellembourg , or break down the intrenchments of Blenheim  to wrest from them the sceptre of universal monarchy , and confine them again to their own dominions .


To the British regiments , his majesty has joined a large body of the forces of his own electorate , without regard to the danger which may threaten his dominions in the absence of his troops , having no other view than to secure the publick tranquillity at whatever hazard of his own , and being convinced that private interest is most effectually secured by a steady attention to general good .


These measures , my lords , undoubtedly demand our gratitude and applause .
Gratitude is always due to favourable intentions , and diligent endeavours , even when those intentions are frustrated , and those endeavours defeated  and applause is often paid to success , when it has been merely the effect of chance , and been produced by measures ill adapted to the end which was intended by them .
But , surely , when just designs have been happily executed , when wise measures are blessed with success , neither envy nor hatred will dare to refuse their acclamations  surely , those will at least congratulate , whom the corruption of their hearts hinders from rejoicing , and those who can not love , will at least commend .


Here , my lords , I suspect no inclination to depreciate the happiness that we enjoy , or to calumniate that virtue by which it has been obtained  and therefore doubt not but your lordships will readily concur in the reasonable , motion which I have now to offer : --


`` That an humble address be presented to his majesty , to return him the thanks of this house , for his most gracious speech from the throne .


`` To declare our just sense of his majesty 's great care and vigilance for the support of the house of Austria , and for restoring and securing the balance of power .


`` To acknowledge his majesty 's great wisdom and attention to the publick welfare , in sending so considerable a body of his forces into the Low Countries , and in strengthening them with his electoral troops , and the Hessians in the British pay  and thereby forming such an army as may defend and encourage those powers who are well intentioned , and give a real assistance to the queen of Hungary , and to assure his majesty of the concurrence and support of this house , in this necessary measure .


`` To express our satisfaction in the good effects which the vigour exerted by Great Britain in assisting its ancient allies , and maintaining the liberties of Europe , hath already had on the affairs of the queen of Hungary , and on the conduct of several powers  and our hopes that a steady perseverance in the same measures , will inspire the like spirit and resolution in other powers , equally engaged by treaties and common interest to take the like part .


`` To give his majesty the strongest assurances , that this house has the honour and safety of his majesty , the true interest and prosperity of his kingdoms , the security and advancement of their commerce , the success of the war against Spain , and the reestablishment of the balance and tranquillity of Europe entirely at heart .
That these shall be the great and constant objects of our proceedings and resolutions , this house being determined to support his majesty in all just and necessary measures for attaining those great and desirable ends , and to stand by and defend his majesty against all his enemies . ''


Lord MONTFORT spoke next to the following effect : -- My lords , the motion offered by the noble lord , is , in my opinion , so proper and just , so suitable to the dignity of this assembly , and so expressive of the gratitude which the vigilance of his majesty for the publick good , ought to kindle in every heart not chilled by ungenerous indolence , or hardened by inveterate disaffection , that I can not discover any reason for which it can be opposed , and therefore hope that every lord will concur in it with no less alacrity and zeal than I now rise up to second it .


It may , indeed , naturally be hoped from this house , that his majesty 's measures will be readily approved , since they are such as even malice and faction will not dare to censure or oppose , such as calumny will not venture to defame , and such as those who will not praise them can never mention .
If it be allowed , that the interest of France is opposite to that of Britain , that the equipoise of power on the continent is to be preserved  if any of the counsels of our ancestors deserve our attention , if our victories at Cressy or at Ramillies are justly celebrated by our historians , the wisdom of our sovereign 's conduct can not be denied .


The French , my lords , whom our armies in the reign of Anne saw flying before them  who , from dividing kingdoms , and prescribing laws to mankind , were reduced to the defence of their own country  who were driven from intrenchment to intrenchment , and from one fortification to another , now grown insolent with the pleasures of peace , and the affluence of commerce , Have forgotten the power by which their schemes were baffled , and their arrogance repressed  by which their fabrick of universal monarchy was shattered , and themselves almost buried in the ruins .


Infatuated with the contemplation of their own force , elated with the number of their troops , the magnificence of their cities , and the opulence of their treasury , they have once more imagined themselves superiour to resistance , and again aspire to the command of the universe  they have now for some time assumed the haughty style of the legislators of mankind  and have expected , that princes should appeal to them as to the highest human tribunal , and that nations should submit their claims to their arbitration  they have already assumed the distribution of dominions , and expect that neither peace shall be concluded , nor war proclaimed , but by their permission or advice .


By this gradation of exorbitant claims and oppressive measures , have they at length arrived , my lords , at the summit of insolence  by these steps have they ascended once more the towering throne of universal monarchy  nor was any thing wanting to complete their plan , but that their ancient rival , the German empire , should be reduced to acknowledge their sovereignty , and that the supreme dignity of Europe should be the gift of the French bounty .


The death of the late emperour , without sons , furnished them with an opportunity of executing their design , too favourable to be neglected .
They now imagined it in their power , not only to dispose of the imperial dignity , but to divide the dominions of the house of Austria into many petty sovereignties , incapable singly of opposing them , and unlikely to unite in any common cause , or to preserve a confederacy unbroken , if they should by accident agree to form it .


They , therefore , sent their armies into Germany , to superintend the approaching election , and by hovering over the territories of princes unable to resist them , extorted voices in favour of their ally  a prince , whose dominions must , by their situation , always oblige him to compliance with the demands , and to concurrence in the schemes of his protectors , and who will rather act as the substitute of France , than the emperour of Germany .


But it was to no purpose that they had graced their dependant with titular honours and ensigns of sovereignty , if the house of Austria still retained its hereditary dominions , and preserved its strength when it had lost its dignity .
They well knew that armies were equally formidable , whether commanded by an emperour or an inferiour sovereign  and that a mere alteration of names , though it might afford a slight and transient gratification to vanity , would produce no real increase or diminution of power .


They , therefore , thought it necessary to improve the present time of confusion , and excite all the princes of the empire to revive their ancient claims upon the Austrian territories  claims , which how long soever they had been forgotten , howsoever abrogated by long prescription , or annulled by subsequent treaties , were now again to become valid , and to be decided by the arbitration of France .


But this project being defeated by the heroick constancy of the queen of Hungary , whose wisdom and resolution , which will equal her name in future histories with those of the most successful conquerors , rejected their mediation , and refused to own her right doubtful , by submitting it to be tried  they were obliged no longer to dissemble their designs , or make farther pretences to respect or tenderness .
Her fall was necessary to their own exaltation  they , therefore , kindled a general conflagration of war , they excited all the princes to take arms against her , and found it , indeed , no difficult task to persuade them to attack a princess , whom they thought unable to form an army , whom they believed they should rather pursue than engage , and whose dominions might be overrun without bloodshed , and whom they should conquer only by marching against .


Such a combination as this , a combination of monarchs , of which each appeared able singly to have carried on a war against her , nothing but the highest degree of magnanimity could have formed a design of resisting  nor could that resistance have procured the least advantages , or retarded for a single day the calamities that were threatened , had it not been regulated by every martial virtue , had not policy united with courage , and caution with activity .


Thus did the intrepidity of this princess , my lords , support her against the storms that shook her kingdom on every side  thus did those , whom her virtues gained over to her service , and whom her example animated with contempt of superiour numbers , defend her against the forces of all the surrounding nations , led on by monarchs , and elated with the prospect of an easy conquest .


But the utmost that could be hoped from the most refined stratagems , or the most exalted courage , was only that her fate might be deferred , that she would not fall wholly unrevenged , that her enemies would suffer with her , and that victory would not be gained without a battle .
It was evident , that bravery must in time give way to strength , that vigour must be wearied , and policy exhausted , that by a constant succession of new forces , the most resolute troops must be overwhelmed  and that the house of Austria could only gain by the war , the fatal honour of being gloriously extinguished .


This his majesty 's wisdom easily enabled him to discover , and his goodness incited him to prevent  he called upon all the powers , who had promised to preserve the Pragmatick sanction , to have regard to the faith of nations , and by fulfilling their engagements , to preserve the liberties of Europe  but the success of his remonstrances only afforded a new instance of the weakness of justice , when opposed to interest or fear .
All the potentates of the continent were restrained by the threats , or gained by the promises of France  and the disposal of the possessions of the Austrian house , seemed , by the general consent of Europe , to be resigned to the family of Bourbon .


But our sovereign was not yet discouraged from asserting the rights which he had promised to maintain , nor did he think the neglect or treachery of others a sufficient reason for refusing that assistance , which justice and policy equally required .
He knew the power of his own empire , and though he did not omit to cultivate alliances , he was conscious of his ability to proceed without them  and therefore showed , by sending his troops into the Austrian territories , that the measures of the sovereign of Britain were not to be regulated by either his enemies or his confederates  that this nation is yet able to support its own claims , and protect those of its allies  and that while we attack one of the kingdoms of the house of Bourbon , we are not afraid to set the other at defiance .


The effects of this conduct , my lords , were immediately apparent  the king of Sardinia engaged to oppose the entrance of the Spaniards into Italy  the king of Prussia not only made a peace with the queen of Hungary , by whom he was more to be dreaded than any other enemy , but entered into an alliance with his majesty , who has made no small addition to his influence , by another treaty with the most powerful nations of the north .


Thus , my lords , are the dreadful arms of France , which are never employed but in the detestable and horrid plan of extending slavery , and supporting oppression , stopped in the full career of success .
Thus is the scheme of universal monarchy once more blasted , and the world taught , that the preservation of the rights of mankind , the security of religion , and the establishment of peace , are not impracticable , that the power of Britain is yet undiminished , and that her spirit is not yet depressed .


By his majesty 's conduct , my lords , the reputation of our country is now raised to its utmost height  we are now considered as the arbiters of empire , the protectors of right , the patrons of distress , and the sustainers of the balance of the world .
I can not , therefore , but conclude , that no man in this illustrious assembly will be unwilling to acknowledge that wisdom and firmness , which not only this nation , but the greatest part of the universe , will remember with gratitude in the remotest ages , and that the motion , which I now second , will be universally approved .


The speaker then read the motion , and asked in the usual form , whether it was their lordships ' pleasure that the question should be put  upon which lord CHESTERFIELD rose up , and spoke to the following purpose : -- My lords , though the motion has been , by the noble lord who made it , introduced with all the art of rhetorick , and enforced by him that seconded it , with the utmost ardour of zeal , and the highest raptures of satisfaction and gratitude  though all the late measures have been recommended to our applause , as proofs of the strictest fidelity , and the most sagacious policy  and though I am very far from intending to charge them with weakness or injustice , or from pretending to have discovered in them a secret tendency to advance any interest in opposition to that of Britain , I am yet not able to prevail upon myself to suppress those scruples which hinder me from concurring with them , and from approving the address which is now proposed .


I am less inclined , my lords , to favour the present motion , because I have long been desirous of seeing the ancient method of general addresses revived by this house  a method of address by which our princes were reverenced without flattery , and which left us at liberty to honour the crown , without descending to idolize the ministry .


I know not , my lords , what advantages have been procured by an annual repetition of the speeches from the throne , however gracious or excellent .
For ourselves , we have certainly obtained no new confidence from the crown , nor any higher degree of honour among the people .
The incense , which from our censers has so long perfumed the palace , has inclined the nation to suspect , that we are long enough inured to idolatry , to offer up their properties for a sacrifice , whenever they shall be required  and I can not dissemble my suspicions , that a long continuance of this custom may give some ambitious or oppressive prince in some distant age , when , perhaps , this beneficent and illustrious family may be extinct , the confidence to demand it .


I can not but be of opinion , and hope your lordships will be convinced upon very short reflection , that there is a style of servility , which it becomes not this house to use even to our monarchs : we are to remember , indeed , that reverence which is always due from subjects , but to preserve likewise that dignity which is inseparable from independence and legislative authority .


That we ought not to descend to the meanest of flattery , that we ought to preserve the privilege of speaking , without exaggerated praises , or affected acknowledgments , our regard not only to ourselves , but to our sovereign ought to remind us .
For nothing is more evident , my lords , than that no monarch can be happy while his people are miserable  that the throne can be secure only by being guarded by the affections of the people  and the prince can only gain and preserve their affections , by promoting their interest , and supporting their privileges .


But how , my lords , shall that monarch distinguish the interest of his people , whom none shall dare to approach with information ?
How shall their privileges be supported , if when they are infringed , no man will complain ?
And who shall dare to lay any publick grievances , or private wrongs before the king of Britain , if the highest assembly of the nation shall never address him but in terms of flattery ?


The necessity of putting an end to this corrupt custom , becomes every day more and more urgent  the affairs of Europe are hastening to a crisis , in which all our prudence , and all our influence will be required  and we ought , therefore , to take care not to perplex our resolutions by voluntary ignorance , or destroy our credit by a publick approbation of measures , which we are well known not to understand .


I suppose , none of your lordships , who are not engaged in the administration of affairs , will think it derogatory from the reputation of your abilities and experience , to confess , that you do not yet see all the circumstances or consequences of the measures which you are desired to applaud  measures which have been too lately taken to discover their own tendency , and with relation to which no papers have been laid before us .
We are told of armies joined , and treaties concluded , and , therefore , called upon to praise the wisdom of our negotiations , and the usefulness and vigour of our military preparations  though we are neither acquainted on what terms our alliances are formed , nor on what conditions our auxiliaries assist us .


This , my lords , is surely such treatment as no liberal mind can very patiently support  it is little less than to require that we should follow our guides with our eyes shut  that we should place implicit confidence in the wisdom of our ministers , and having first suffered them to blind ourselves , assist them afterwards to blind the people .


The longer I dwell upon the consideration of this motion , the more arguments arise to persuade me , that we ought not hastily to agree to it .
My lords , the address proposed , like the speech itself , is of a very complicated and intricate kind , and comprises in a few words many transactions of great importance , crowded together with an artful brevity , that the mind may be hindered by the multitude of images , from a distinct and deliberate consideration of particulars .
Here are acts of negotiation confounded with operations of war , one treaty entangled with another , and the union of the Hanoverians with our troops , mentioned almost in the same sentence with the Spanish war .
This crowd of transactions , so different in their nature , so various in their consequences , who can venture to approve in the gross ?
or who can distinguish without long examination .


I hope , my lords , that I shall not be charged with want of candour , in supposing the motion not to be an extemporaneous composition , but to be drawn up with art and deliberation .
It is well known , that the address is often concerted at the same time that the speech is composed  and that it is not uncommon to take advantage of the superiority which long acquaintance with the question gives those who defend the motion , above those who oppose it .


We are indeed told , that the visible effects of his majesty 's measures prove their expediency , and that we may safely applaud that conduct of which we receive the benefits .
But , my lords , the advantages must be seen or felt before they can be properly acknowledged  and it has not been shown , that we have yet either intimidated the enemies of the queen of Hungary , whose interest we have been lately taught to believe inseparable from our own , or encouraged any new allies to declare in her favour .


The Dutch , my lords , are not yet roused from their slumber of neutrality  and how loudly soever we may assert our zeal , or with whatever pomp we may display our strength , they still seem to doubt either our integrity or force  and are afraid of engaging in the quarrel , lest they should be either conquered or betrayed .
Nor has the approach of our army , however they may be delighted with the show , inspired them with more courage , though they are enforced by the troops of Hanover .


The addition of these forces to the British army , has been mentioned as an instance of uncommon attention to the great cause of universal liberty , as a proof that no regard has been paid to private interest , and that all considerations are sacrificed to publick good .
But since no service can be so great but it may be overpaid , it is necessary that we may judge of the benefit , to inform us on what terms it has been obtained , and how well the act of succession has been observed on this occasion .


Though I am too well acquainted , my lords , with the maxims which prevail in the present age , and have had too much experience of the motives , by which the decisions of the senate are influenced , to offer any motion of my own , yet these reasons will withhold me from concurring with this .
I can not but be of opinion , that the question ought to be postponed to another day , in which the house may be fuller , our deliberations be assisted by the wisdom and experience of more than thirty lords , who are now absent , and the subjects of inquiry , of which many are new and unexpected , may be more accurately considered  nor can I prevail upon myself to return to general declarations any other than general answers .


Lord CARTERET answered in substance as follows : -- My lords , as there has arisen no new question , as his majesty in assisting the queen of Hungary , has only followed the advice of the senate  I am far from being able to discover , why any long deliberation should be necessary to a concurrence with the motion now before us , or whence any doubt can arise with regard to the effects of his majesty 's measures  effects which no man will deny , who will believe either his own eyes , or the testimony of others  effects , which every man who surveys the state of Europe must perceive , and which our friends and our enemies will equally confess .


To these measures , which we are now to consider , it must be ascribed , that the French are no longer lords of Germany  that they no longer hold the princes of the empire in subjection , lay provinces waste at pleasure , and sell their friendship on their own terms .
By these measures have the Dutch been delivered from their terrours , and encouraged to deliberate freely upon the state of Europe , and prepare for the support of the Pragmatick sanction .
But the common cause has been most evidently advanced by gaining the king of Prussia , by whose defection the balance of the war was turned , and at least thirty thousand men taken away from the scale of France .


This , my lords , was a change only to be effected by a patient expectation of opportunities , and a politick improvement of casual advantages , and by contriving methods of reconciling the interest of Prussia with the friendship of the queen of Hungary  for princes , like other men , are inclined to prefer their own interest to all other motives , and to follow that scheme which shall promise most gain .


That all this , my lords , has been effected , can not be denied  nor can it be said to have been effected by any other causes than the conduct of Britain : had this nation looked either with cowardly despair , or negligent inactivity , on the rising power of France and the troubles of the continent  had the distribution of empire been left to chance , our thoughts confined wholly to commerce , and our prospects not extended beyond our own island , the liberties of Europe had been at an end , the French had established themselves in the secure possession of universal monarchy , would henceforth have set mankind at defiance , and wantoned without fear in oppression and insolence .


These , my lords , are consequences of the measures pursued by his majesty , of which neither the reality nor the importance can be questioned , and , therefore , they may doubtless be approved without hesitation .
For surely , my lords , the addition of the Hanoverian troops to the forces of our own nation can raise no scruples , nor be represented as any violation of the act of settlement .


Of the meaning of that memorable act , I believe , I do not need any information .
I know it is provided , that this nation shall not be engaged in war in the quarrel of Hanover  but I see no traces of a reciprocal obligation , nor can discover any clause , by which we are forbidden to make use in our own cause of the alliance of Hanover , or by which the Hanoverians are forbidden to assist us .


I hope , my lords , this representation of the state of our transactions with Hanover , will not be charged with artifice or sophistry .
I know how invidious a task is undertaken by him who attempts to show any connexion between interests so generally thought opposite , and am supported in this apology only by the consciousness of integrity , and the intrepidity of truth .


The assistance of Hanover , my lords , was , at this time , apparently necessary .
Our own troops , joined with the Hessians , composed a body too small to make any efficacious opposition to the designs of France  but by the addition of sixteen thousand men , became sufficiently formidable to oblige her to employ those troops for the security of her frontiers , with which she intended to have overwhelmed Italy , and to have exalted another Spanish prince to a new kingdom .
The Spaniards , deprived of this assistance , harassed by the Austrians with perpetual alarms , and debarred by our fleet from the supplies which are provided for them in their own country , must languish with penury and hardships , being equally cut off from succour and from flight .


Thus , my lords , it is evident , that the true and everlasting interest of Britain has been steadily pursued  that the measures formed to promote it have been not only prudent , but successful .
We did not engage sooner in the quarrel , because we were not able to form an army sufficiently powerful .
An advantageous peace is only to be obtained by vigorous preparations for war  nor is it to be expected that our enemies should court our friendship , till they see that our opposition is really formidable .
Such , my lords , is our present state  we may reasonably hope that the French will desist from their designs , because they will have a confederacy to oppose , more powerful than that by which their immortal monarch was lately humbled  and I hope that conduct will always be applauded in this house , which enables us to repress the arrogance of France .


Lord WESTMORELAND then spoke to the following purport : -- My lords , though the warmth with which the noble lord has defended the motion , and the confidence with which he asserts the propriety and efficacy of the measures to which it relates , are such proofs of the strength of his conviction as leave no room to doubt his sincerity  yet as the same arguments do not operate upon different minds with the same force , I hope I shall not be thought less sincere , or less studious of the publick happiness , or the honour of the crown , though I presume to differ from him .


In the motion now before us , I can not concur , because , though it should be allowed to contain a just representation of foreign affairs , yet it appears to me to omit those considerations which I think it the duty of this house to offer to his majesty .
This nation is , in my opinion , exposed to enemies more formidable than the French  nor do I think that we are at leisure to defend the liberties of Europe , till we have made some provisions for the security of our own  or to regulate the balance of power , till we have restored our constitution to its ancient equilibrium .


That there are flagrant proofs of the most enormous corruption throughout the whole subordination of publick offices  that our publick funds are only nurseries of fraud , and that trust of every kind is only considered as an opportunity of plundering , appears evidently from the universal prevalence of luxury and extravagance , from the sudden affluence of private men , from the wanton riot of their tables , the regal splendour of their equipages , and the ostentatious magnificence of their buildings .


It is evident , likewise , that corruption is not confined to publick offices  that those who have lost their own integrity , have endeavoured to destroy the virtue of others  that attempts have been made to subject the whole nation to the influence of corruption , and to spread the contagion of bribery from the highest to the lowest classes of the people .


It is therefore necessary , before we engage in the consideration of foreign affairs , to prosecute the inquiry which was begun in the last session , to trace wickedness to its source , and drag the authors of our miseries into the light .


These , my lords , are the inquiries which the general voice of the people importunately demands  these are the petitions which ought never to be rejected  all parties are now united , and all animosities extinguished  nor is there any other clamour than for inquiries and punishment .


The other house , my lords , has been engaged in the laudable attempt to detect those who have betrayed , or plundered , or corrupted their country  and surely we ought to have so much regard to our own honour , as not to suffer them to toil alone in a design so popular , so just , and so necessary , while we amuse ourselves with applauding the sagacity of our ministers , who , whatever they may hope themselves , or promise others , have not yet prevailed on any foreign power to concur with them , or to interpose in the affairs of the continent .
And , therefore , I can not conceal my suspicion , that instead of furnishing any subject for panegyricks on our policy and caution , we are now wasting our treasures and our strength in a romantick expedition .


Since , therefore , my lords , our domestick evils seem to me most dangerous , I move , that in order to their speedy remedy , and that the people may see we do not forget their immediate interest , this addition be made to the motion now before us :


`` And humbly to assure his majesty , that we will apply our constant and persevering endeavours to calm and heal animosities and divisions , unseasonable as they are at all times , and most pernicious in the present juncture , which the true fatherly tenderness of his majesty , out of the abundance of his constant care for the rights and liberties of his people , has so affectionately at the close of last session recommended from the throne , by searching thoroughly and effectually into the grounds , which are or may be assigned for publick discontent , agreeably to the ancient rules and methods of parliament . ''


This additional clause being delivered in writing to the speaker , he read it to the house , but said that the noble lord spoke so low , that he could not tell where he proposed to have it inserted .
Lord WESTMORELAND then directed him to read the motion , which done , he desired that his clause might be added at the end .


Upon this lord RAYMOND spoke as follows : -- My lords , the addition which the noble lord has offered to the address proposed , can not , in my opinion , be properly admitted , as it has no relation to the preceding clauses , but is rather inconsistent with them .


Nor do I think it only improper with regard to the other part of the motion , but unnecessary in itself  since it has no reference to his majesty 's speech , now under our consideration  since it will facilitate none of our inquiries , which may be carried on with equal vigour without any such unseasonable declaration of our design .


If , therefore , the motion for the amendment be not withdrawn , I shall move , that the first question be first put .


[ The question was then put with regard to the first motion , and it passed in the affirmative , without any division . ]


HOUSE OF COMMONS , DECEMBER 10 , 1742 .


Motion in the committee of supplies , for granting pay for sixteen thousand Hanoverian troops for the four months last past .


Sir William YONGE opened the debate , and spoke in substance as follows : -- Sir , though the general state of the kingdoms of Europe can not be supposed to be wholly unknown in this assembly , yet since the decision of the question now before us , must depend upon the conceptions which every man has formed with regard to the affairs on the continent , it will be necessary to exhibit them to view in a narrow compass , that nothing which may contribute to our information may be overlooked or forgotten .


The late emperour , for some time before his death , finding that there remained little hopes of male issue , and that his family would be consequently in danger of losing part of the honours and dignities which it had so long enjoyed , turned his thoughts to the security of his hereditary dominions , which he entailed upon his eldest daughter , to preserve them from being broken into fragments , and divided among the numerous pretenders to them  and that this settlement might be preserved from violation , employed all the opportunities which any extraordinary conjunctures presented to him of obtaining the concurrence and ratification of the neighbouring states .


As it was always the interest of this nation to support the house of Austria , as a counterbalance to the power of France , it was easy to procure from us a solemn accession to this important settlement  and we , therefore , promised to support it , whenever it should be attacked .
This was , in reality , only a promise to be watchful for our own advantage , and to hinder that increase of the French influence , which must , at length , be fatal to ourselves .


The like engagements were proposed to many other powers , which proposals were by most of them accepted , and among others by France , upon consideration of a very large increase of her dominions  and it was hoped , that whatever might be determined by the electors with respect to the imperial dignity , the hereditary dominions to the house of Austria would remain in the same family , and that France would be hindered by her own engagements from disturbing the peace of the empire .


But no sooner did the death of the emperour give the enemies of the house of Austria hopes of gratifying without danger their resentment and ambition , than almost all the neighbouring princes began to revive their pretensions , and appeared resolved to recover by force , what they alleged to have been only by force withheld from them .
Armies were raised on all sides , invasions either attempted or threatened from every quarter , and the whole world looked upon the daughter of Austria either with pity or with joy , as unable to make any stand against the general confederacy , and under a necessity of yielding to the most oppressive terms , and purchasing peace from her enemies at their own price .


It can not be mentioned , without indignation , that this universal combination was formed and conducted by the influence of the French , who , after having agreed to the Pragmatick sanction , omitted no endeavours to promote the violation of it  and not only incited the neighbouring princes to assert their claim by promises of assistance , but poured numerous armies into the empire , not only to procure by force , and without the least regard to equity , an election in favour of the duke of Bavaria , but to assist him in the invasion of the Austrian dominions , of which the settlement had been ratified by their concurrence , purchased at a price which might justly have been thought too great , even though they had observed their stipulations .


The pleas which they advanced in vindication of their conduct , it is not necessary to relate  since , however artfully they may be formed , the common sense of mankind must perceive them to be false .
It is to no purpose , that they declare themselves not to have receded from their promise , because they enter the empire only as auxiliaries , and their troops act under the command of the elector of Bavaria  since he that furnishes troops for the invasion of those territories which he is obliged to protect , may very justly be considered as an invader  as he who assists a thief , partakes the guilt of theft .


All contracts , sir , whether between states or private persons , are to be understood according to the known intention of the two parties  and I suppose it will not be pretended , by the most hardened advocate for the conduct of the French , that the late emperour would have purchased , at so dear a rate , their accession to the Pragmatick sanction , if he had supposed , that they still thought themselves at liberty to employ all their treasure and their force in assisting others to violate it .


It is well known , that an unsuccessful war , which the French are likewise suspected of assisting , had , a short time before the death of the emperour , weakened his forces , and exhausted his revenues  and that , therefore , when he was surprised by death , he left his family impoverished and defenceless  so that his daughter being without money or armies , and pressed by enemies on every side of her dominions , was immediately reduced to such distress as , perhaps , she only was able to support , and such difficulties as no other would have entertained the least hope of being able to surmount .


In the first crush of her calamities , when she was driven by the torrent of invasion from fortress to fortress , and from kingdom to kingdom , it is not to be denied , that most of the guarantees of the Pragmatick sanction stood at gaze , without attempting that relief which she incessantly called upon them to afford her  and which , indeed , they could deny upon no other pretence , than that they were convinced it would be ineffectual , that her ruin was not to be prevented , and that she must be swallowed up by the deluge of war , which it appeared impossible to resist or to divert .


The queen , however , determined to assert her rights , and to defend her dominions  and , therefore , assembled her forces , and made such opposition , that some of her enemies finding the war , to which they were encouraged only by a belief of the certainty of success , likely to become more hazardous than they expected , soon desisted from their claims , and consented to peace upon moderate conditions  and the most formidable of her enemies , being alienated from the French by experience of their treachery , and , perhaps , intimidated by the bravery of his enemies , was at last willing to become neutral , and to be satisfied with the recovery of his own claims , without assisting the elector of Bavaria .


Thus far has this illustrious princess struggled in the tempest of the continent with very little assistance from her confederates  but it can not be supposed , that these violent efforts have not exhausted her strength , or that she must not be , at length , overpowered by the armies which the French , enraged at the disappointment of their schemes , are sending against her .
She has an incontestable claim to our assistance , promised by the most solemn stipulations , and , therefore , not to be withheld upon any views of present advantage .
The prudence and magnanimity which she has discovered , prove , that she deserves to be supported upon the common principles of generosity , which would not suffer a brave man to look idly upon a heroine struggling with multitudes  and the opposition which she has been able to make alone , shows that assistance will not be vain .


These considerations , though , since the senate has determined to assist her , they are not immediately necessary in a question which relates only to the manner in which that assistance shall be given , are yet not entirely useless  since they may contribute to overbalance any prejudices that may obstruct the schemes which have been formed , and quicken the endeavours of men who might be inclined to reject those counsels to which any specious objections shall be raised , or to lose that time in deliberation , which ought to be employed in action .


As the assistance of this distressed princess has been already voted by the senate , it is now no longer to be inquired , what advantages can be gained to this nation by protecting her , or whether the benefits of victory will be equivalent to the hazards of war ?
These questions are already determined .
It has already appeared necessary to this house , to restore the balance of power by preserving the house of Austria  and the only question , therefore , that remains is , by what means we shall endeavour to preserve it ?
and whether the means that have already been used , deserve our approbation ?


Among the several schemes that were proposed for this end , it appeared most proper to the ministry to form an army in the low countries , whence they might be ready to march wherever their presence might be required , and where they might be easily supplied with necessaries .
This army was to be raised with expedition  the affairs of the queen of Hungary could admit of no delay  auxiliary troops were , therefore , to be hired , and it appeared to them more proper to hire the troops of Hanover than of any other nation .


That the affairs of the queen of Hungary would admit of no delay , and that , therefore , the army in the low countries was very speedily to be formed , can not be doubted by any one that compares her power with that of the nation against which she was contending  a nation incited by a long train of success to aspire to universal monarchy  a nation which has long been assembling armies , and accumulating treasures , in order to give law to the rest of the world  which had for many years stood against the united force of all the bordering powers , and to which the house of Austria is not equal in its full strength , much less when its treasures had been exhausted , and its troops destroyed in an unfortunate war before the death of the emperour  and when almost every part of its dominions was threatened by a particular power , and the troops of each province were employed in the defence of their own towns  so that no great armies could be collected , because no place could be left without defenders .


Such was the state of the Austrian dominions , when the troops of France broke in upon them  and in this state it must readily be acknowledged , that neither courage nor prudence could procure success  that no stratagems could long divert , nor any resistance repel such superiority of power , and that , therefore , relief must be speedy , to be efficacious .


That to bring the relief which we had promised , with expedition sufficient to procure any advantages to our ally , to preserve her provinces from being laid waste , her towns from being stormed , and her armies from being ruined  to repress the confidence of the French , and recall them from conquests to the defence of their own territories , it was apparently necessary to hire foreign troops  for to have sent over all our own forces , had been to have tempted the French to change their design of invading the Austrian dominions , into that of attacking Britain , and attempting to add this kingdom to their other conquests  to have raised new troops with expedition equal to the necessity that demanded them , was either absolutely impossible , or at least , very difficult  and when raised , they would have been only new troops , who , whatever might be their courage , would have been without skill in war , and would , therefore , have been distrusted by those whom they assisted , and despised by those whom they opposed .


Nothing , therefore , remained , but that auxiliaries should be tried , and the only question then to be decided , was , what nation should be solicited to supply us ?
Nor was this so difficult to be answered as in former times , since there was not the usual liberty of choice  many of the princes who send their troops to fight for other powers , were at that time either influenced by the promises , or bribed by the money , or intimidated by the forces of France  some of them were engaged in schemes for enlarging their own dominions , and therefore were unwilling to supply others with those troops for which they were themselves projecting employment  and , perhaps , of some others it might reasonably be doubted , whether they would not betray the cause which they should be retained to support , and whether they would not in secret wish the depression of the queen of Hungary , by means of those invaders whom they promised to resist .


Sir , amidst all these considerations , which there was not time completely to adjust , it was necessary to turn their eyes upon some power to which none of these objections could be made  and , therefore , they immediately fixed upon the electorate of Hanover , as subject to the same monarch , and of which , therefore , the troops might be properly considered as our national allies , whose interest and inclinations must be the same with our own , and whose fidelity might be warranted by our own sovereign .


It was no small advantage that the contract for these troops could be made without the delay of tedious negotiations  that they were ready to march upon the first notice , and that they had been long learned in the exactest discipline .


The concurrence of all these circumstances easily determined our ministers in their choice , and the troops were ordered to join the Britons in the Low Countries  a step which so much alarmed the French , that they no longer endeavoured to push forward their conquests , nor appeared to entertain any other design than that of defending themselves , and returning in safety to their own country .


Such was the conduct of our ministry , such were their motives , and such has been their success  nor do I doubt but this house will , upon the most rigorous examination , find reason to approve both their integrity and prudence .
Of their integrity they could give no greater proof , than their confidence of the agreement of this house to measures which , though conformable in general to our resolutions , were not particularly communicated to us  because , indeed , it could not be done without loss of time , which it was necessary to improve with the utmost diligence , and a discovery of those designs , which ought only to be known by the enemy after they were executed .
Of their prudence , their success is a sufficient evidence  and , therefore , I can not doubt but gentlemen will give a sanction to their conduct , by providing , according to the estimates before the committee , for the support of troops , which have been found of so great use .


Lord POWLETT rose up next , and spoke to the effect following : -- Sir , the honourable gentleman has with so much clearness and elegance displayed the state of Europe , explained the necessity of hiring foreign troops , and showed , the reasons for which the troops of Hanover were preferred to those of any other nation , that I believe it not to be of any use to urge other arguments than those which he has produced .


As , therefore , it is indisputably necessary to hire troops , and none can be hired which can be so safely trusted as those of Hanover , I can not but agree with the right honourable gentleman , that this measure of his majesty ought to be supported .


Sir JOHN ST. AUBYN then spoke as follows : -- Sir , it is with the greatest difficulties that I rise up to give you this trouble , and particularly after the honourable gentleman with whom I am so very unequal to contend .
But when my assent is required to a proposition , so big with mischiefs , of so alarming a nature to this country , and which I think , notwithstanding what the honourable gentleman has most ingeniously said , must determine from this very day , who deserves the character and appellation of a Briton , I hope you will forgive me , if I take this last opportunity which perhaps I may ever have of speaking with the freedom of a Briton in this assembly .


I am not able to follow the honourable gentleman in any refinements of reason upon our foreign affairs  I have not subtilty enough to do it , nor is it in my way as a private country gentleman .
But though country gentlemen have not that sagacity in business , and , for want of proper lights being afforded us , the penetration of ministers into publick affairs  yet give me leave to say , they have one kind of sense which ministers of state seldom have , and at this time it is of so acute a nature , that it must , overthrow the arguments of the most refined administration  this is the sense of feeling the universal distresses of their country , the utter incapacity it now lies under of sustaining the heavy burdens that are imposing upon it .


This I take to be the first , the great object of this day 's debate .
Consider well your strength at home , before you entangle yourselves abroad  for if you proceed without a sufficient degree of that , your retreat will be certain and shameful , and may in the end prove dangerous .
Without this first , this necessary principle , whatever may be the machinations , the visionary schemes of ministers , whatever colourings they may heighten them with , to mislead our imaginations , they will prove in the end for no other purpose , but to precipitate this nation , by empty captivating sounds , into the private views and intrigues of some men , so low , perhaps , in reputation and authority , as to be abandoned to the desperate necessity of founding their ill possessed precarious power upon the ruins of this country .


Next to the consideration of our inward domestick strength , what foreign assistances have we to justify this measure ?
Are we sure of one positive active ally in the world ?
Nay , are not we morally certain that our nearest , most natural ally , disavows the proceeding , and refuses to cooperate with us ?
One need not be deep read in politicks to understand , that when one state separates itself from another , to which it is naturally allied , it must be for this plain reason , that the interest is deserted which is in common to them both .
And it is an invariable rule in this country , a rule never to be departed from , that there can no cause exist in which we ought to engage on the continent , without the aid and assistance of that neighbouring state .
This is the test , the certain mark , by which I shall judge , that the interest of this country is not at present the object in pursuit .


Is any man then wild enough to imagine , that the accession of sixteen thousand Hanoverian mercenaries will compensate for the loss of this natural ally ?
No  but it is said that this indicates such a firmness and resolution within ourselves , that it will induce them to come in .
Sir , if they had any real proofs of our firmness and resolution , that the interest of this country was to be pursued , I dare say they would not long hesitate .
But they look with a jealous eye upon this measure , they consider it as an argument of your weakness , because it is contrary to the genius and spirit of this country , and may , therefore , lessen his majesty in the affections of his people .


They have for some years past looked upon a British parliament as the corrupt engine of administration , to exhaust the riches , and impair the strength of this country .
They have heard it talk loudly , indeed , of the house of Austria , when it was in your power to have raised her to that state , in which she was properly to be considered as the support of the balance of Europe , if timid neutralities had not intervened , and our naval strength had properly interposed to her assistance .


They have lately looked upon this parliament , and with the joy of a natural ally they have done it , resenting your injuries , bravely withstanding the power , that you might restore the authority of your government , demanding constitutional securities , appointing a parliamentary committee for inquiry and justice .
Sir , they now see that inquiry suppressed , and justice disappointed .
In this situation , what expectations can we form of their accession to us  talking bigly , indeed , of vindicating foreign rights , but so weak and impotent at home , as not to be able to recover our own privileges ?


But this measure is said to be undertaken in consequence of the advice of parliament .
There has been great stress laid upon this .
It has been loudly proclaimed from the throne , echoed back again from hence , and the whole nation is to be amused with an opinion , that upon this measure , the fate of the house of Austria , the balance and liberties of Europe , the salvation of this country , depend .


But was this fatal measure the recommendation of parliament , or was it the offspring of some bold enterprising minister , hatched in the interval of parliament , under the wings of prerogative  daring to presume upon the corruption of this house , as the necessary means of his administration ?
The object , indeed , might be recommended , but if any wrong measure is undertaken to attain it , that measure surely should be dropt  for it is equally culpable to pursue a good end by bad measures , as it is a bad end by those that are honest .


But as to the address , I wish gentlemen would a little consider the occasion which produced it .
Sir , it proceeded from the warmth of expectation , the exultation of our hearts , immediately after , and with the same breath that you established your committee of inquiry  and it is no forced construction to say , that it carries this testimony along with it , that national securities and granting supplies were reciprocal terms .


But , sir , I must own for my part , was the occasion never so cogent , Hanoverian auxiliaries are the last that I would vote into British pay  not upon the consideration only , that we ought otherwise to expect their assistance , and that we should rather make sure of others that might be engaged against us  but from this melancholy apprehension , that administrations will for ever have sagacity enough to find out such pretences , that we may find it difficult to get rid of them again .


Besides , the elector of Hanover , as elector of Hanover , is an arbitrary prince  his electoral army is the instrument of that power  as king of Great Britain he is a restrained monarch .
And though I do n't suspect his majesty , and I dare say the hearts of the British soldiery are as yet free and untainted , yet I fear that too long an intercourse may beget a dangerous familiarity , and they may hereafter become a joint instrument , under a less gracious prince , to invade our liberties .


His majesty , if he was rightly informed , I dare say would soon perceive the danger of the proposition which is now before you .
But , as he has every other virtue , he has , undoubtedly , a most passionate love for his native country , a passion which a man of any sensation can hardly divest himself of  and , sir , it is a passion the more easily to be flattered , because it arises from virtue .
I wish that those who have the honour to be of his councils , would imitate his royal example , and show a passion for their native country too  that they would faithfully stand forth and say , that , as king of this country , whatever interests may interfere with it , this country is to be his first , his principal care  that in the act of settlement this is an express condition .
But what sluggish sensations , what foul hearts must those men have , who , instead of conducting his majesty 's right principles , address themselves to his passions , and misguide his prejudices ?
making a voluntary overture of the rights and privileges of their country , to obtain favour , and secure themselves in power  misconstruing that as a secondary consideration , which in their own hearts they know to be the first .


Sir , we have already lost many of those benefits and restrictions which were obtained for us by the revolution , and the act of settlement .
For God 's sake , let us proceed no farther .
But if we are thus to go on , and if , to procure the grace and favour of the crown , this is to become the flattering measure of every successive administration , -- this country is undone !


Mr. BLADEN then rose up , and spoke to the following purport : -- Sir , if zeal were any security against errour , I should not willingly oppose the honourable gentleman who has now declared his sentiments  and declared them with such ardour , as can hardly be produced but by sincerity  and of whom , therefore , it can not be doubted , that he has delivered his real opinion  that he fears from the measures which he censures , very great calamities  that he thinks the publick tranquillity in danger  and believes that his duty to his country obliged him to speak on this occasion with unusual vehemence .


But I am too well acquainted with his candour to imagine , that he expects his assertions to be any farther regarded than they convince  or that he desires to debar others from the same freedom of reason which he has himself used .
I shall therefore proceed to examine his opinion , and to show the reasons by which I am induced to differ from him .


The arguments upon which he has chiefly insisted , are the danger of hiring the troops of Hanover in any circumstances , and the impropriety of hiring them now without the previous approbation of the senate .


The danger of taking into our pay the forces of Hanover , the contrariety of this conduct to the act of settlement , and the infraction of our natural privileges , and the violation of our liberties which is threatened by it , have been asserted in very strong terms , but I think not proved with proportionate force  for we have heard no regular deduction of consequences by which this danger might be shown , nor have been informed , how the engagement of sixteen thousand Hanoverians to serve us against France for the ensuing year , can be considered as more destructive to our liberties than any other forces .


It is , indeed , insinuated , that this conduct will furnish a dangerous precedent of preference granted to Hanover above other nations  and that this preference may gradually be advanced , till in time Hanover may , by a servile ministry , be preferred to Britain itself , and that , therefore , all such partiality ought to be crushed in the beginning , and its authors pursued with indignation and abhorrence .


That to prefer the interest of Hanover to that of Britain would be in a very high degree criminal in a British ministry , I believe no man in this house will go about to deny  but if no better proof can be produced , that such preference is intended than the contract which we are now desired to ratify , it may be with reason hoped , that such atrocious treachery is yet at a great distance  for how does the hire of Hanoverian troops show any preference of Hanover to Britain ?


The troops of Hanover are not hired by the ministry as braver or more skilful than those of our own country  they are not hired to command or to instruct , but to assist us  nor can I discover , supposing it possible to have raised with equal expedition the same number of forces in our own country , how the ministry can be charged with preferring the Hanoverians by exposing them to danger and fatigue .


But if it be confessed , that such numbers would not possibly be raised , or , at least , not possibly disciplined with the expedition that the queen of Hungary required , it will be found , that the Hanoverians were at most not preferred to our own nation , but to other foreigners , and for such preference reasons have been already given which I shall esteem conclusive , till I hear them confuted .


The other objection on which the honourable gentleman thought it proper to insist , was the neglect of demanding from the senate a previous approbation of the contract which is now before us  a neglect , in his opinion , so criminal , that the ministry can not be acquitted of arbitrary government , of squandering the publick money by their own caprice , and of assuming to themselves the whole power of government .


But the proof of this enormous usurpation has not yet been produced  for it does not yet appear , that there was time to communicate their designs to the senate , or that they would not have been defeated by communication  and , therefore , it is yet not evident , but that when they are censured for not having laid their scheme before the senate , they are condemned for omitting what was not possibly to be done , or what could not have been done , without betraying their trust , and injuring their country .


It is allowed , that the senate had resolved to assist the queen of Hungary  and , therefore , nothing remained for the ministers but to execute with their utmost address the resolution that had been formed  if for the prosecution of this design they should be found to have erred in their choice of means , their mistakes , unless some ill designs may justly be suspected , are to be imputed to the frailty of human nature , and rather to be pitied , and relieved as misfortunes , than punished as crimes .


But I doubt not , that in the course of our deliberations , we shall find reason for concluding that they have acted not only with fidelity but prudence  that they have chosen the means by which the great end which the senate proposed , the succour of the queen of Hungary , and consequently the reestablishment of the balance of power , will be most easily attained  and that they have taken into the pay of this nation those troops which may be trusted with the greatest security , as they have the same prince , and the same interest .


But the honourable gentleman appears inclined to advance a new doctrine , and to insinuate , that when any vote is passed by the senate , the ministers are to suppose some conditions which are to be observed , though they were never mentioned , and without which the voice of the senate is an empty sound .
In pursuance of this supposition , he calls upon us to recollect the time and circumstances in which this vote was passed  he reminds us , that the concession was made in a sudden exultation of our hearts , in the raptures of triumph , and amidst the shouts of conquest , when every man was forming expectations which have never been gratified , and planning schemes which could never be perfected .


He seems therefore to think , that our ministers insidiously took advantage of our intoxication , and betrayed us in a fit of thoughtless jollity to a promise , which when made , we hardly understood , and which we may , therefore , now retract .
He concludes , that the concession which might then escape us ought not to have been snatched by our ministers , and made the foundation of their conduct , because they knew it was made upon false suppositions , and in prospect of a recompense that never would be granted .


I hope there is no necessity for declaring , that this reasoning can not safely be admitted , since , if the vote of the senate be not a sufficient warrant for any measure , no man can undertake the administration of our affairs , and that government which no man will venture to serve must be quickly at an end .


For my part , I know not how the nation or the senate has been disappointed of any just expectations , nor can I conceive that any such disappointments vacate their votes or annul their resolutions , and therefore I can not but think the ministry sufficiently justified , if they can show that they have not deviated from them .


Lord QUARENDON spoke next to the effect following : -- Sir , I am so far from thinking that the past conduct or the present proposals of the ministry deserve approbation , that , in my opinion , all the arguments which have been produced in their favour are apparently fallacious , and even the positions on which they are founded , and which are laid down as uncontrovertible , are generally false .


It is first asserted , that we are indispensably obliged to assist the queen of Hungary against France , and to support her in the possession of the hereditary dominions of the Austrian house , and from thence is precipitately inferred the necessity of assembling armies , and hiring mercenaries , of exhausting our treasure , and heaping new burdens upon the publick .


That we concurred with other powers in promising to support the Pragmatick sanction is not to be denied , nor do I intend to insinuate , that the faith of treaties ought not strictly to be kept  but we are not obliged to perform more than we promised , or take upon ourselves the burden which was to be supported by the united strength of many potentates , and of which we only engaged to bear a certain part .
We ought , undoubtedly , to furnish the troops which we promised , and ought to have sent them when they were first demanded  but there is no necessity that we should supply the deficiencies of every other power , and that we should determine to stand alone in defence of the Pragmatick sanction  that we should , by romantick generosity , impoverish our country , and entail upon remotest posterity poverty and taxes .
We ought to be honest at all events  we are at liberty , likewise , to be generous at our own expense , but I think we have hardly a right to boast of our liberality , when we contract debts for the advantage of the house of Austria , and leave them to be paid by the industry or frugality of succeeding ages .


It is , therefore , at least , dubious , whether we ought to hazard more than we promised in defence of the house of Austria  and , consequently , the first proposition of those who have undertaken the defence of the ministry requires to be better established , before it becomes the basis of an argument .


But though it be allowed , that we ought to exceed our stipulations , and engage more deeply in this cause than we have promised , I can not yet discover upon what principles it can be proved , that sixteen thousand Hanoverians ought to be hired .
Why were not our troops sent which have been so long maintained at home only for oppression and show ?
Why have they not at last been shown the use of those weapons which they have so long carried , and the advantages of that exercise which they have been taught to perform with so much address ?
Why have they not , at length , been shown for what they had so long received their pay , and informed , that the duty of a soldier is not wholly performed by strutting at a review ?


If it be urged , that so great a number could not be sent out of the kingdom without exposing it to insults and irruptions , let it be remembered how small a force was found sufficient for the defence of the kingdom in the late war , when the French were masters of a fleet which disputed , for many years , the empire of the sea  and it will appear , whether it ought to be imputed to prudence or to cowardice , that our ministers can not now think the nation safe without thrice the number , though our fleets cover the ocean , and steer from one coast to another without an enemy .


But to show more fully the insufficiency of the vindication which has been attempted , and prove , that no concession will enable the ministry to defend their schemes , even this assertion shall be admitted .
We will allow for the present , that it is necessary to garrison an island with numerous forces against an enemy that has no fleet .
I will grant , that invaders may be conveyed through the air , and that the formidable , the detestable pretender may , by some subterraneous passage , enter this kingdom , and start on a sudden into the throne .
Yet will not all this liberality avail our ministers , since it may be objected , that new forces might easily have been raised , and our own island have been , at once , defended , and the queen of Hungary assisted by our native troops .


Since the necessity of expedition is urged , it may reasonably be inquired , what it was that appeared so immediately necessary , or what has been brought to pass by this wonderful expedition ?
Was it necessary to form an army to do nothing ?
Could not an expedition in which nothing was performed , in which nothing was attempted , have been delayed for a short time , and might not the queen of Hungary have been preserved equally , whether the troops of her allies slept and fattened in her country or their own ?


Nothing , surely , can be more ridiculous than to expatiate upon the necessity of raising with expedition an useless body of forces , which has only been a burden to the country in which it has been stationed , and for which pay is now demanded , though they have neither seen a siege nor a battle  though they have made no attempt themselves , nor hindered any that might have been made by the enemy .


To make this plea yet more contemptible , we are informed , that if we had raised an army of our countrymen , they would have been unacquainted with arms and discipline , and , therefore , they could not have done what has been done by these far-famed Hanoverians .
This , indeed , I can not understand , having never found , that the Britons needed any documents or rules to enable them to eat and drink at the expense of others , to bask in the sun , or to loiter in the street , or perform any of the wonders that may be ascribed to our new auxiliaries  and , therefore , I can not but think , that all the actions of the four months for which those forces expect to be paid , might have been brought to pass by new-raised Britons , who might in the mean time have learned their exercise , and have been made equal to any other soldiers that had never seen a battle .


But if foreign troops were necessary , I am still at a loss to find out why those of Hanover were chosen , since it appears to me , that by hiring out his troops to Britain , our monarch only weakens one hand to strengthen the other .
It might be expected , that he should have employed these troops against France without hire , since he is not less obliged , either by treaty or policy , to protect the house of Austria as elector of Hanover , than as king of Britain .


Since , therefore , the troops of Hanover were hired , without the consent of the senate , they have hitherto performed nothing  and since it is reasonable to expect , that without being paid by Britain they will be employed against the French , I think it expedient to discharge them from our service , and to delay the pay which is required for the last four months , till it shall appear how they have deserved it .


Mr. FOX then rose , and spoke to the following purport : -- Sir , though the observations of the right honourable gentleman must be allowed to be ingenious , and though the eloquence with which he has delivered them , naturally excites attention and regard , yet I am obliged to declare , that I have received rather pleasure than conviction from his oratory  and that while I applaud his imagination and his diction , I can not but conclude , that they have been employed in bestowing ornaments upon errour .


I shall not , indeed , attempt to confute every assertion which I think false , or detect the fallacy of every argument which appears to me sophistical , but shall leave to others the province of showing the necessity of engaging in the war on the continent , of employing a large force for the preservation of the house of Austria , and of forming that army with the utmost expedition , and of taking auxiliaries into our pay , and confine myself to this single question , whether , supposing auxiliaries necessary , it was not prudent to hire the troops of Hanover ?


Nothing can be , in my opinion , more apparent , than that if the necessity of hiring troops be allowed , which surely can not be questioned , the troops of Hanover are to be chosen before any other , and that the ministry consulted in their resolutions the real interest of their country , as well as that of our ally .


The great argument which has in all ages been used against mercenary troops , is the suspicion which may justly be entertained of their fidelity .
Mercenaries , it is observed , fight only for pay , without any affection for the master whom they serve , without any zeal for the cause which they espouse , and without any prospect of advantage from success , more than empty praises , or the plunder of the field , and , therefore , have no motives to incite them against danger , nor any hopes to support them in fatigues  that they can lose nothing by flight , but plunder , nor by treachery , but honour  and that , therefore , they have nothing to throw into the balance against the love of life , or the temptations of a bribe , and will never be able to stand against men that fight for their native country under the command of generals whom they esteem and love , and whom they can not desert or disobey , without exposing themselves to perpetual exile , or to capital punishment .


These arguments have always been of great force , and , therefore , that nation whose defence has been intrusted to foreigners , has always been thought in danger of ruin .
Yet there have been conjunctures in which almost every state has been obliged to rely upon mercenaries , and in compliance with immediate necessity , to depend upon the fidelity of those who had no particular interest in supporting them .
But with much greater reason may we trust the success of the present war , in some degree , to the troops of Hanover , as they are , perhaps , the only foreign forces against which the arguments already recited are of no force .
They are foreigners , indeed , as they are born in another country , and governed by laws different from ours  but they are the subjects of the same prince , and , therefore , naturally fight under the same command  they have the same interest with ourselves in the present contest , they have the same hopes and the same fears , they recommend themselves equally to their sovereign by their bravery , and can neither discover cowardice nor treachery , without suffering all the punishment that can be feared by our native troops , since their conduct must be censured by the same prince of whose approbation they are equally ambitious , and of whose displeasure they are equally afraid .


As to the troops which any neutral prince might furnish , there would be reason to fear , that either for larger pay , or upon any casual dispute that might arise , they might be withdrawn from our service when they were most needed , or transferred to the enemy at a time when his distress might compel him to offer high terms , and when , therefore , there was a near prospect of an advantageous peace .
But of the troops of Hanover no such suspicion can be formed , since they can not engage against us without rebelling against their prince  for it can not be imagined , that his majesty will fight on one side as elector of Hanover , and on the other as king of Britain  or that he will obstruct the success of his own arms , by furnishing the troops of Hanover to the enemies of this kingdom .


It , therefore , appears very evident , that we have more to hope and less to fear from the troops of Hanover , than from any other  since they have the same reason with ourselves to desire the success of the queen of Hungary , and to dread the increasing greatness of the French  and that they can be suspected neither of treachery nor desertion .
It is not very consistent with that candour with which every man ought to dispute on publick affairs , to censure those measures which have been proposed , without proposing others that are more eligible  for it is the duty of every man to promote the business of the publick  nor do I know why he that employs his sagacity only to obstruct it , should imagine , that he is of any use in the national council .


I doubt not but I shall hear many objections against the use of these troops , and that upon this question , virulence and ridicule will be equally employed .
But for my part , I shall be little affected either with the laughter that may be raised by some , or the indignation that may be expressed by others , but shall vote for the continuance of these measures till better shall be proposed  and shall think , that these troops ought to be retained , unless it can be shown , that any others may be had , who may be less dangerous , or of greater use .


Mr. PITT then rose up , and spoke , in substance as follows : -- Sir , if the honourable gentleman determines to abandon his present sentiments as soon as any better measures are proposed , I can not but believe , that the ministry will very quickly be deprived of one of their ablest defenders  for I think the measures which have hitherto been pursued so weak and pernicious , that scarcely any alteration can be proposed that will not be for the advantage of the nation .


He has already been informed , that there was no necessity of hiring auxiliary troops , since it does not yet appear , that either justice or policy required us to engage in the quarrels of the continent , that there was any need of forming an army in the Low Countries , or that , in order to form an army , auxiliaries were necessary .


But not to dwell upon disputable questions , I think it may be justly concluded , that the measures of our ministry have been ill concerted , because it is undoubtedly wrong to squander the publick money without effect , and to pay armies only to be a show to our friends , and a jest to our enemies .


The troops of Hanover , whom we are now expected to pay , marched into the Low Countries , indeed , and still remain in the same place  they marched to the place most distant from enemies , least in danger of an attack , and most strongly fortified , if any attack had been designed  nor have any claim to be paid , but that they left their own country for a place of greater security .


It is always reasonable to judge of the future by the past  and , therefore , it is reasonable to conclude , that the services of these troops will not , next year , be of equal importance with that for which they are now to be paid  and I shall not be surprised , though the opponents of the ministry should be challenged , after such another glorious campaign , to propose better men , and should be told , that the money of this nation can not be more properly employed than in hiring Hanoverians to eat and sleep .


But to prove yet more particularly , that better measures may be taken , and that more useful troops may be retained , and that , therefore , the honourable gentleman may be expected to quit those to whom he now adheres , I shall show , that in hiring the forces of Hanover , we have obstructed our own designs  that we have , instead of assisting the queen of Hungary , withdrawn part of her allies from her  and that we have burdened the nation with troops , from whom no service can be reasonably expected .


The advocates for the ministry have , on this occasion , affected to speak of the balance of power , the Pragmatick sanction , and the preservation of the queen of Hungary , not only as if they were to be the chief care of Britain , which , though easily controvertible , might , perhaps , in compliance with long prejudices , be admitted , but as if they were to be the care of Britain alone  as if the power of France were formidable to no other people , as if no other part of the world would be injured by becoming a province to an universal monarchy , and being subjected to an arbitrary government of a French deputy , by being drained of its inhabitants , only to extend the conquests of its masters , and to make other nations equally miserable , and by being oppressed with exorbitant taxes , levied by military executions , and employed only in supporting the state of its oppressors .
They dwell upon the importance of publick faith , and the necessity of an exact observation of treaties  as if the Pragmatick sanction had been signed by no other potentate than the king of Britain , or as if the publick faith were to be obligatory to us only .


That we should inviolably observe our treaties , and observe them though every other nation should disregard them  that we should show an example of fidelity to mankind , and stand firm , though we should stand alone in the practice of virtue , I shall readily allow  and , therefore , I am far from advising that we should recede from our stipulations , whatever we may suffer by performing them , or neglect the support of the Pragmatick sanction , however we may be at present embarrassed , or however inconvenient it may be to assert it .


But surely for the same reason that we observe our own stipulations , we ought to incite other powers , likewise , to the observation of theirs  at least not contribute to hinder it .
But how is our present conduct agreeable to these principles ?
The Pragmatick sanction was confirmed not only by the king of Britain , but by the elector , likewise , of Hanover , who is , therefore , equally obliged , if treaties constitute obligation , to defend the house of Austria against the attacks of any foreign power , and to send in his proportion of troops to the support of the queen of Hungary .


Whether these troops have been sent , those whose provinces oblige them to some knowledge of foreign affairs , can inform the house with more certainty than I  but since we have not heard them mentioned in this debate , and have found , by experience , that none of the merits of that electorate are passed over in silence , it may , I think , fairly be concluded , that the distresses of the illustrious queen of Hungary have yet received no alleviation from her alliance with Hanover , that her complaints have moved no compassion at that court , nor the justice of her cause obtained any regard .


To what can we impute this negligence of treaties , this disregard of justice , this defect of compassion , but to the pernicious counsels of those men who have advised his majesty to hire to Britain those troops which he should have employed in the assistance of the queen of Hungary  for it is not to be imagined , that his majesty has more or less regard to justice as king of Britain , than as elector of Hanover  or that he would not have sent his proportion of troops to the Austrian army , had not the temptations of greater profit been industriously laid before him .


But this is not all that may be urged against this conduct  for can we imagine , that the power of France is less , or that her designs are less formidable to Hanover than to Britain ?
nor is it less necessary for the security of Hanover , that the house of Austria should be reestablished in its former grandeur , and enabled to support the liberties of Europe against the bold attempts for universal monarchy .


If , therefore , our assistance be an act of honesty , and granted in consequence of treaties , why may it not equally be required of Hanover ?
And if it be an act of generosity , why should this nation alone be obliged to sacrifice her own interest to that of others ?
Or why should the elector of Hanover exert his liberality at the expense of Britain ?


It is now too apparent , that this great , this powerful , this formidable kingdom , is considered only as a province to a despicable electorate  and that , in consequence of a scheme formed long ago , and invariably pursued , these troops are hired only to drain this unhappy nation of its money .
That they have hitherto been of no use to Britain , or to Austria , is evident beyond controversy  and , therefore , it is plain , that they are retained only for the purposes of Hanover .


How much reason the transactions of almost every year have given for suspecting this ridiculous , ungrateful , and perfidious partiality , it is not necessary to mention .
I doubt not but most of those who sit in this house can recollect a great number of instances , from the purchase of part of the Swedish dominions , to the contract which we are now called upon to ratify .
I hope few have forgotten the memorable stipulation for the Hessian troops , for the forces of the duke of Wolfenbuttel , which we were scarcely to march beyond the verge of their own country , or the ever memorable treaty , of which the tendency is discovered in the name  the treaty by which we disunited ourselves from Austria , destroyed that building which we may , perhaps , now endeavour , without success , to raise again , and weakened the only power which it was our interest to strengthen .


To dwell upon all the instances of partiality which have been shown , to remark the yearly visits that have been made to that delightful country , to reckon up all the sums that have been spent to aggrandize and enrich it , would be at once invidious and tiresome  tiresome to those who are afraid to hear the truth , and to those who are unwilling to mention facts dishonourable or injurious to their country  nor shall I dwell any longer on this unpleasing subject than to express my hopes , that we shall not any longer suffer ourselves to be deceived and oppressed  that we shall at length perform the duty of the representatives of the people , and by refusing to ratify this contract , show , that however the interest of Hanover has been preferred by the ministers , the senate pays no regard but to that of Britain .


Mr. Horace WALPOLE then spoke to the following purpose : -- Sir , though I have long considered the mercenary scribblers of disaffection as the disgrace of the kingdom and the pest of society , yet I was never so fully sensible of their pernicious influence .


I have hitherto imagined , that the weekly journalists and the occasional pamphleteers were the oracles only of the lowest of the people  and that all those whom their birth or fortune has exalted above the crowd , and introduced to a more extensive conversation , had considered them as wretches compelled to write by want , and obliged , therefore , to write what will most engage attention , by flattering the envy or the malignity of mankind  and who , therefore , propagate falsehoods themselves , not because they believe them , and disseminate faction , not because they are of any party , but because they are either obliged to gratify those that employ them , or to amuse the publick with novelties , or disturb it with alarms , that their works may not pass unregarded , and their labour be spent in vain .


This is my opinion of the party writers , and this I imagined the opinion of the rest of mankind , who had the same opportunities of information with myself : nor should I readily have believed , that any of their performances could have produced greater effects than those of inflaming the lowest classes of the people , and inciting drunkards to insult their superiours , had I not perceived , that the honourable gentleman who spoke last , owed his opinions of the partiality shown to the dominions of Hanover , to a late treatise which has , on occasion of this contract , been very industriously dispersed among the people .


Of this detestable pamphlet , I know not the author , nor think he deserves that any inquiry should be made after him , except by a proclamation that may set a price upon his head , and offer the same reward for discovering him , as is given for the conviction of wretches less criminal : nor can I think the lenity of the government easily to be distinguished from supineness and negligence , while libels like this are dispersed openly in the streets , and sold in shops without fear and without danger  while sedition is professedly promoted , and treason , or sentiments very nearly bordering upon treason , propagated without disguise .


The scribbler of this wicked treatise has endeavoured to corrupt the principles of his majesty 's faithful subjects , not only by vilifying the memory of the late king , whose justice , humanity , and integrity , are generally reverenced , but by insinuating , likewise , that our present most gracious sovereign has adopted the same schemes , and endeavours to aggrandize Hanover at the expense of Britain  that all the measures that have been taken with regard to the affairs of the continent , have been contrived with no other view than that of advancing the interest , enlarging the bounds , and increasing the riches of the Hanoverian territories  he declares , that Britain has been steered by the rudder of Hanover , and that the nation will soon be divided into two more opposite and irreconcilable parties than ever yet disturbed the publick peace , Britons and Hanoverians .


That he himself , whoever he be , longs for those times of division and confusion , may be easily believed , and the number of those who have the same wishes with himself , is , I fear , too great  but I believe their hopes will not be encouraged , nor their designs promoted in this house  and that none of those who are intrusted to represent their country , will suffer themselves to be misled by such wicked insinuations .


Mr. NUGENT then spoke to this effect : -- Sir , I know not for what reason the honourable gentleman has thought it convenient , to retard the deliberations of this house , by expatiating upon the falsehood and malignity of a pamphlet , of which the author is unknown , of which no man has attempted the vindication , and which , however diligently dispersed , or however generally credited , appears to have had no great influence upon the nation , nor to have produced any effects that might give just occasion to so tragical an outcry , to censures as vehement and bitter , as if the trumpet of rebellion had been sounded , as if half the people had taken arms against their governours , as if the commonwealth was on the brink of dissolution , and armies were in full march against the metropolis .


This pamphlet , with the rest of the people , I have read  and though I am far from thinking , that the censure of that honourable gentleman can make a defence necessary , since , indeed , be has contented himself with invective instead of argument , and , whatever he may disapprove , has confuted nothing : and though I have no particular reason for exposing myself as the champion for this author , whoever he may be , yet I can not forbear to affirm , that I read some passages with conviction , and that , in my opinion , they require a different answer from those which have been yet offered  and that the impressions which have been made upon the people , will not be effaced by clamour and rage , and turbulence and menaces , which can affect only the person of the writer , but must leave his reasons in their full force , and even with regard to his person , will have very little effect  for though some men in power may be offended , it will not be easy to quote any law that has been broken by him .


On this occasion I can not but animadvert , I hope with the same pardon from the house , as has been obtained by the honourable gentleman whom I am now following , upon an expression in frequent use among the followers of a court , whenever their measures are censured with spirit and with justice .
The papers which they can not confute , and which they have not yet been able to obtain the power of suppressing , are asserted to border upon treason  and the authors are threatened with punishments , when they have nothing to fear from a reply .


Treason is happily denned by our laws , and , therefore , every man may know when he is about to commit it , and avoid the danger of punishment , by avoiding the act which will expose him to it  but with regard to the borders of treason , I believe no man will yet pretend to say how far they extend , or how soon , or with how little intention he may tread upon them .
Unhappy would be the man who should be punished for bordering upon guilt , of which those fatal borders are to be dilated at pleasure by his judges .
The law has hitherto supposed every man , who is not guilty , to be innocent  but now we find that there is a kind of medium , in which a man may be in danger without guilt , and that in order to security , a new degree of caution is become necessary  for not only crimes , but the borders of crimes are to be avoided .


What improvements may be made upon this new system , how far the borders of treason may reach , or what pains and penalties are designed for the borderers , no degree of human sagacity can enable us to foresee .
Perhaps the borders of royalty may become sacred , as well as the borders of treason criminal  and as every placeman , pensioner , and minister , may be said to border on the court , a kind of sanctity may be communicated to his character , and he that lampoons or opposes him , may border upon treason .


To dismiss this expression with the contempt which it deserves , yet not without the reflections which it naturally excites , I shall only observe , that all extension of the power of the crown must be dangerous to us  and that whoever endeavours to find out new modes of guilt , is to be looked on , not as a good subject , but a bad citizen .


Having thus shown , that the censure produced against this pamphlet is unintelligible and indeterminate , I shall venture to mention some of the assertions which have heated the gentleman into so much fury .
Assertions which I can not be supposed to favour , since I wish they might be false , and which I only produce in this place to give some , whom their stations make acquainted with publick affairs , an opportunity of confuting them .


It is asserted , that the French appear to have treated all our armaments with contempt , and to have pursued all their schemes with the same confidence as if they had no other enemy to fear than the forces of Austria  this is , indeed , no pleasing observation , nor can it be supposed to give satisfaction to any Briton , to find the reputation of our councils and of our arms so much diminished , to find the nation which lately gave laws to Europe , scarcely admitted to friendship , or thought worthy of opposition in enmity , to hear that those troops , which , in the days of our former monarchs , shook the thrones of the continent , are passed by , without fear , and without regard , by armies marching against their allies , those allies in whose cause they formerly fought in the field .
But the truth of the assertion is too plain to all the nations of the world  and those whose interest it may be to conceal from their countrymen what is known to all the continent , may rage , indeed , and threaten , but they can not deny it  for what enterprise have we hitherto either prevented or retarded ?
What could we have done on one side , or suffered on the other , if we had been struck out from existence , which has not been suffered , or not done , though our armies have been reviewed on the continent , and , to make yet a better show , lengthened out by a line of sixteen thousand of the troops of Hanover .


It is asserted in the same treatise , that the troops of Hanover can not act against the king , and that , therefore , they are an useless burden to the state  that they compose an army of which no other effect will be found but that they eat , and eat at the expense of Britain .
This assertion is , indeed , somewhat more contestable than the former , but is at least credible  since , if we may be permitted on this , as on other occasions , to judge of the future from the past , we may conclude , that those who have let pass such opportunities as their enemies have in the height of contempt and security presented to them , will hardly ever repair the effects of their conduct , by their bravery or activity in another campaign  but that they will take the pay of Britain , and , while they fatten in plenty , and unaccustomed affluence , look with great tranquillity upon the distresses of Austria , and , in their indolence of gluttony , stand idle spectators of that deluge , by which , if it be suffered to roll on without opposition , their own halcyon territories must at last be swallowed up .


The last assertion which I shall extract from this formidable pamphlet , is more worthy of attention than the former , but , perhaps , may be suspected to border more nearly upon treason : I shall , however , venture to quote , and , what is still more dangerous , to defend it .


It is proposed that , instead of squandering , in this time of danger , the expenses of the publick upon troops of which it is at best doubtful , whether they will be of any use to the queen of Hungary , whether they can legally engage against the king , and whether they would be of any great use , though they were set free from any other restraints than regard to their own safety  instead of amusing our ally with an empty show of assistance , of mocking her calamities with unefficacious friendship , and of exposing ourselves to the ridicule of our enemies , by idle armaments without hostility , by armies only to be reviewed , and fleets only to be victualled , we should remit the sums required for the payment of the Hanoverians to the queen of Hungary , by whom we know that it will be applied to the great purposes for which the senate granted it , the establishment of the liberties of Europe , and the repression of the house of Bourbon .


This proposal , however contrary to the opinion of the ministers , I take the liberty of recommending to the consideration of the house , as , in my opinion , the most effectual method of preserving the remains of the greatness of the house of Austria .
It is well known , that these troops are hired at a rate which they never expected before , that levy-money is paid for forces levied before the commencement of the bargain , that they are paid for acting a long time before they began to march , and that , since they appeared to consider themselves as engaged in the quarrel , their march has been their whole performance , a march not against the enemy , but from him  a march , in which there was nothing to fear , nor any thing to encounter  and , therefore , I think it can not be denied , that the publick treasure might have been better employed .


The same sum remitted to the queen of Hungary , will enable her to hire a much greater number of troops out of her own dominions , troops of whose courage she can have no doubt , and whose fidelity will be strengthened by common interest and natural affection  troops that will fight like men , defending their wives and their children , and who will , therefore , bear fatigue with patience , and face danger with resolution  who will oppose the French as their natural enemies , and think death more eligible than defeat .


Thus shall we assert the rights of mankind , and support the faith of treaties , oppose the oppressors of the world , and restore our ancient allies to their former greatness , without exhausting our own country  for it is not impossible , that by the proper use of this sum , the queen may obtain such advantages in one campaign , as may incline the French to desert the king , and content themselves with the peaceable possession of their own territories  for it is to be remembered , that they are now fighting only for a remote interest , and that they will not hazard much  a firm resistance will easily incline them to wait for some more favourable opportunity , and there will be then leisure for forming our measures in such a manner , that another opportunity may never be offered them .


But of the present scheme , what effect can be expected but ignominy and shame , disgrace abroad , and beggary at home ?
to this expense what limits can be set ?
when is there to be an end of paying troops who are not to march against our enemies ?
as they will at all times be of equal use , there will be at all times the same reason for employing them , nor can there ever be imagined less need of idle troops , than in a time of war .


I am , therefore , afraid , that in a short time the Hanoverians may consider Britain as a tributary province , upon which they have a right to impose the maintenance of sixteen thousand men , who are to be employed only for the defence of their own country , though supported at the expense of this .
I am afraid that we shall be taught to imagine , that the appearance of the Hanoverians is necessary in our own country , perhaps to check the insolence of the sons of freedom , who , without fear , border upon treason .
I am afraid , that his majesty or his successour may be advised by sycophants and slaves to trust the guard of his person to the trusty Hanoverians , and advised to place no confidence in the natives of Britain .


For my part , I think it a very wise precept by which we are directed to obviate evils in the beginning  and therefore , since , in my opinion , the influence of Hanover must be destructive to the royal family , and detrimental to those kingdoms , I shall endeavour to obviate it by voting against any provision for these useless mercenaries , and declaring that I shall more willingly grant the publick money to any troops than those of Hanover .


Lord PERCIVAL spoke next as follows : -- Sir , I look upon the question now under your consideration , to vary very little in reality from that which was debated here the first day of this session .
The principal point in the debate of that day , was the same with that which is more regularly the debate of this , whether the Hanoverian forces should be taken into British pay ?


Sir , I should then have offered my sentiments upon this question , if so many other gentlemen had not delivered my sense in so much a better manner than I thought myself able to do , that it would have appeared a great presumption in me , and would have given the house an unnecessary trouble .
The same reason had induced me to have been silent also upon this occasion , if the temper of the times , the little indulgence shown by gentlemen to one another , when they happen to differ in political opinions , and the popular circumstance in which I stand , did not in some sort oblige me to protect the vote I then gave , and that which I now intend to give , by the reasons that induce me to give it .


Sir , there are three principal considerations in this question  first , whether we are to assist the house of Austria and balance of power at all , aye or no ?
then , whether we ought to do it with our whole force ?
and lastly , whether the Hanoverian troops should be made a part of that force ?


As to the first consideration , a new doctrine has been taught and inculcated for some months past , that it is of no importance to this nation what may happen on the continent  that this country being an island intrenched within its own natural boundaries , it may stand secure and unconcerned in all the storms of the rest of the world .
This doctrine , inconsistent as it is with all sense and reason , contrary as it is to the universal principles of policy by which this nation hath been governed from the conquest to this hour , is yet openly professed and avowed by many without these walls  and though no man has yet ventured to own this opinion publickly and directly in this house , yet some gentlemen even here , in effect maintain it , when they argue , that in no case this nation ought to assist or support the balance of power without the concurrence of the Dutch .
This tends inevitably to produce the same fatal effect  it reduces this country to depend upon Holland , to be a province to Holland  and France would then have no more to do to become mistress of all Europe , than to gain over one single town of the United Provinces , or to corrupt a few members of the States  it is , therefore , a doctrine of the greatest danger .
The only solid maxim is , that whoever becomes master of the continent , must in the end obtain the dominion of the sea .
To confirm this , I may venture to cite an old example , nor can I be accused of pedantry in doing of it , since it is an instance drawn from the last universal monarchy to which the world submitted .
The Romans had no sooner divided , broken and subdued those powers upon the continent of Europe , who had given a diversion in the great attempt they had long intended , than they attacked the Carthaginians , a maritime power , potent in arms , immensely opulent , possessed of the trade of the whole world , and unrivalled mistress of the sea .
Yet these people , who enjoyed no wealth , pursued no commerce , and at the commencement of their quarrel were not masters of a single ship , at length prevailed against this enemy upon their proper element , beat and destroyed their fleets , invaded their dominions , and subdued their empire .
From whence , sir , I must conclude , that we can not wholly rely upon our situation , or depend solely on our naval power  and I may venture to reason upon this axiom , that this nation must contribute to support the house of Austria and the balance of power in some degree .


The next question that occurs , is , in what degree we ought to do it , and whether we should do it with our whole force ?
Taking , therefore , our footing here upon this axiom , that we must contribute to it in some degree , and taking farther to our aid the reasoning of those gentlemen , who think it a work of such extreme danger , and almost desperate , the natural and evident conclusion can be only this , that as we must do it , so we must do it with the utmost vigour , and with our whole force .


We come now to consider , whether the Hanoverian troops should be made part of that force ?
There are several considerations previous to the decision of this question .
First , whether they are as cheap as any other forces we can hire ?
Then , whether they are as good ?
Next , whether they are as properly situated ?
And whether they are as much to be depended upon ?
If , as to every one of these particulars , the answer must be made in the affirmative , I think it will go very far to determine the question now before you .


As to the first , that they are as cheap , nay , upon the whole , much cheaper , the estimates now upon your table , notwithstanding any cavil , do sufficiently demonstrate .


That they are as good , what man can doubt , who knows the character of the German nation ?
What man can doubt , who knows the attention of his majesty to military discipline ?
Those gentlemen can least pretend to doubt it , who sometimes do not spare reflections upon that attention which they insinuate to be too great .


That these troops are not properly situated , will be hardly asserted at this time , when they are actually now in Flanders , and now acting in conjunction with our troops .
Let any man consider the map of Europe , let him observe the seat of the war , and he must evidently see , that whether their service may be required in Flanders , whether upon the Rhine , or in the heart of Germany , in every one of these cases , the Hanoverian forces are as properly circumstanced and situated as any troops in Europe .


It remains in the last place to examine , whether any other troops can be better depended upon  and sure nothing can be more obvious than that we may rely with more security on these than any other .
They are subjects of the same prince , and of a prince indulgent to all his subjects , and accused by those who differ in other points from me , of being partial against the interest of his German dominions .
Unless , therefore , we arraign the first principle upon which a free government can be supported , and without which every exercise of arbitrary power would be warranted , we must allow that such a people will be faithful to such a prince , will defend him with a strict fidelity , and support his quarrel with the utmost zeal  with a zeal which can never be expected from the mercenary troops of any other foreign power .


This naturally leads us to inquire what other troops we can depend upon  the answer to this inquiry is short and positive  that as affairs now stand abroad , we can depend upon none but these  let us carry this consideration with us in a survey of all Europe  shall we take into our pay sixteen thousand of the Dutch ?
Would this be the means of bringing Holland into alliance with us ?
Would they act at their own expense , would they exert their own proper force ?
Would they pay their own troops in aid of the common cause , when they found this nation ready to do it for them ?
They would act like madmen if they did .
Shall we hire Danes ?
Is there a gentleman in this house , who is not convinced that this power has been warped , for some time past , towards the interest of France ?
When we hired these troops in the last instance , did they not deceive us ?
Did they not even refuse to march ?
nay , farther , are they not in all appearance now upon the point of being employed in a quarrel of their own ?
a quarrel in which they will have need of all their force .
Shall we then hire Saxons ?
An honourable gentleman seemed to think that there may be some possibility of this , and perhaps there may hereafter , when the king of Prussia 's views are known , and the part he shall resolve to act  but Saxony is certainly now too much exposed to , and can not fail to be alarmed at his growing power  at the great augmentation of his armies , and the secret and vast designs which he seems to meditate .
This measure , therefore , is not practicable in the present conjuncture  that electorate can not hazard its own security in these precarious circumstances , by lending out so great a body of its troops .
Would gentlemen advise the hire of Prussian troops to serve us in this conjuncture ?
They who do advise it , must forget strangely the part so lately acted by that prince , and the variety of his conduct with regard to his different allies within the space of the two last years .
I shall guard myself in my expressions , and maintain a proper respect in discoursing of so great a character  but I must say thus much , that the ministry would act with great imprudence , to put the safety of the British troops , and to risk the fate of this army , upon the event of such a measure .
I need not say more  for it is not yet proved to us , that this prince would ( I wish there was no reason to believe he would not ) lend us this body of his men , though we should be disposed to take them into pay .
The Swiss cantons , therefore , now alone remain  and indeed from them we probably might procure a greater number  but I leave it to the judgment of any man of sense and candour , whether any minister of this nation could warrant the employment of sixteen thousand Swiss in this service ?
For when we reflect upon the situation of these provinces , and compare it with that of our British troops who are now in Flanders , it is visible that they must pass four hundred miles upon the borders of the Rhine , flanked by the strong places of France , during their whole march , exposed to the garrisons and armies upon that frontier , by whom it can never be supposed that they would be suffered to pass unmolested , when France must so well know the intention of their march to be for no other end , but to make a conjunction with other troops in the British pay , in order afterwards to invade , or at least to interrupt the views of that kingdom with their united force .


These reasons , sir , prove invincibly to me , that if we are to assist the house of Austria by an army , we must , of prudence , nay , of necessity , in part , compose that army of the Hanoverian troops .


But yet there is another state of this question , an alternative of which some gentlemen seem very fond , whether it would not be better to assist the queen of Hungary with money only ?


This opinion at first sight is extremely plausible  if the queen of Hungary has been able to do so much with an aid of 500,000 l. what might she not be able to do with a million more ?
Sir , a million more would by no means answer in the same proportion .
When a sum is given her , which with the best economy can suffice barely to put her troops in motion , when the enemy is at her very gates , her all at an immediate stake , there can be no room for a misapplication of it .
But a sum so immense as that of a million and a half , would dazzle the eyes of a court so little used to see such sums  and as an honourable gentleman , [ Mr. Horace WALPOLE , ] long versed in foreign affairs , and well acquainted with these matters , told you in a former debate , would be much of it squandered among the Austrian ministers and favourites .
I make no scruple to add to this , that some small part might fall to the share of ministers elsewhere .
But there is another danger which gentlemen who contend for this measure do not consider : can they who profess a distrust of all ministers , and particularly those who are now employed at home  they who have ever argued against all votes of credit , upon this principle , that it affords an opportunity to ministers of defrauding the service , and of putting large sums into the purse of the crown , or into their private pockets  can they now argue for this measure , which I may be bold to say , would be in effect the most enormous vote of credit that was ever given in the world ?
Gentlemen insinuate , that the taking the Hanoverian forces into British pay , is a criminal complaisance , calculated only to confirm an infant and a tottering administration .
But how much greater means for such a purpose , would an alternative like this afford ?
Suppose a minister , unfirm in his new-acquired power , to ingratiate himself with his prince , should propose a scheme to replenish the coffers of an exhausted civil list , squandered in such vile purposes , that no man could have the hardiness to come to parliament , or dare to hope a supply for it by any regular application to this house ?
What method could be devised by such a minister himself , to do the job more excellent than this ?
For who can doubt that ( guard it how you will ) the queen of Hungary might be induced , in the condition in which she now stands , to accept a million , and to give a receipt in full for the whole sum ?
How could you prevent an understanding of this kind between two courts ?
and how easy , therefore , might it be to sink 500,000 l. out of so vast a grant ?
Sir , I will suspect no minister , but I will trust none in this degree  and I wonder other gentlemen do not suspect , if I do not .
From hence , therefore , I consider this as a proposition both fallacious and unsafe  for though it be a fact , that the same sum of money might maintain in Austria double the number of troops  yet , if no more than half that money should be applied ( as I have shown great reason to believe that it would not ) to the uses of the war , it is evident that you would deceive yourselves , and would have but an equal number of raw , irregular , undisciplined , and much worse troops for it .


But , sir , there is yet a stronger argument against the supply in money only .
What are our views in supporting the queen of Hungary ?
Our views are general and particular  general , to save the house of Austria , and to preserve a balance of power  particular , to prevent the French from making any farther acquisitions on this side of Flanders .
The first might possibly be answered in a good degree , by giving that princess an equivalent in money  but the second can not be securely provided against , without an army on this side of Europe in the British pay .
Sir , is it not natural for every one of us to guard our vital parts , rather than our more remote members ?
Would not the queen of Hungary ( stipulate and condition with her as you please ) apply the greatest part of these subsidies in defence of her dominions in the heart of Germany ?
Might it not even induce her to enlarge her views , and to think of conquests and equivalents for what she has already lost , which it might be vain and ruinous for us to support her in ?
Would she not leave Flanders to shift for itself , or still to be taken care of by the Dutch and Britain ?
In such a case , if France should find it no longer possible to make any impression on her territories on the German side , what must we expect to be the consequence ?
I think it very visible she would on a sudden quit her expensive and destructive projects on that quarter , and there only carry on a defensive war , while she fell with the greater part of her force at once upon the Low Countries , which would by this measure be wholly unprovided  and she might there acquire in one campaign , before any possibility of making head against her , ( which the Dutch would hardly attempt , and could certainly not alone be able to effect , ) all that she has been endeavouring for the last century to obtain , and what no union of powers could be ever capable of regaining from her .
All this will be effectually prevented by an army paid by us on this side of Europe  an army ready to march to the borders of her country , and to intercept her succours and supplies for the German war  an army , ready to protect the petty states , whose interest and inclination it apparently must be to declare for us , and to join their forces with us , when they no longer fear the power of France  an army , which may possibly give courage and spirit to greater powers , who may still doubt , without these vigorous measures , ( after what they have formerly experienced , ) whether they could even yet depend upon us  an army , ( if the posture of affairs should make it necessary , ) able to cause a powerful diversion to the French forces , by an attack upon Lorrain and Champagne , and still within distance to return upon its stops in time , to prevent the French from carrying any point of consequence in Flanders , should they then attempt it .


One argument more , I beg leave to mention , and it is of great weight .
Admit that the sums raised upon the subject might be greater in the one case than the other , the sums remitted out of the kingdom would be infinitely less .
Whatever is remitted to the queen of Hungary , is buried in the remotest parts of Germany , and can never return to us  whereas in a war carried on by troops in our own pay on this side , by much the greater part of the expense returns to us again , in part by the pay of officers , by the supply of provisions and necessaries in a country exhausted by armies , ammunition , ordnance , horses , clothing , accoutrements , and a multitude of other articles , which I need not enumerate , because experience , which is the soundest reasoner , fully proved it in the example of the last war , at the conclusion of which , notwithstanding the prodigious sums expended in it , this nation felt no sensible effect , from a diminution of its current specie .


Sir , I was prepared to have spoken much more largely to this subject , but my discourse has already been drawn to a greater length than I imagined , in treating upon the argument thus far .
I shall , therefore , avoid troubling you any farther upon it at this time  I shall only observe , that in my humble opinion , it is sufficiently proved , first , that we must assist the house of Austria , and that we must do it with all our force  next , that we can not do it with money only , but in part with a land army , and that this land army can not be conveniently ( I may say possibly ) composed , at this time , without the Hanoverian troops .
This question , therefore , can , I think , be no longer debated , but upon the foot of popular prejudices and insinuations of an improper connexion of Hanoverian and British interests  but as I could not enter into this subject without concern and indignation , and as it is a very delicate point for me in particular to debate upon , I shall leave this part of the question to other gentlemen , who can engage in it both with less inconvenience , and with more ability , than it is possible for me to do .


To which Mr. George GRENVILLE replied in substance : -- Sir , though I am far from thinking myself able to produce , without study or premeditation , a complete answer to the elaborate and artful harangue which you have now heard , yet as I can not be convinced of the reasonableness of the measures which have been defended with so much subtilty , I shall at least endeavour to show , that my disapprobation is not merely the effect of obstinacy , and that I have at least considered the proposals of the ministry , before I have ventured to condemn them .


Whether we ought to think ourselves indispensably obliged to maintain , at all events , the balance of power on the continent , to maintain it without allies , to maintain it against a combination of almost all Europe , I shall not now inquire  I will suppose it , for once , our duty to struggle with impossibility , and not only to support the house of Austria when it is attacked , but to raise it when it is fallen  fallen by our own negligence , and oppressed with the weight of all the surrounding powers  and shall , therefore , at present , only inquire by what means we may afford that assistance with most benefit to our allies , and least danger to ourselves .


With regard to our ally , that assistance will be apparently most advantageous to her , by which her strength will be most increased , and therefore it may , perhaps , be more useful to her to find her money than troops  but if we must supply her with troops , I doubt not but it will readily appear , that we may easily find troops which may be of more use and less expense than those of Hanover .


It has been observed , with regard to the convenient situation of those troops , that it can not now be denied , since they are acting in Flanders in conjunction with the British forces .
This is an assertion to which , though it was uttered with an air of victorious confidence , though it was produced as an insuperable argument , by which all those who intended opposition were to be reduced to silence and despair , many objections may be made , which it will require another harangue equally elaborate to remove .


That the troops of Hanover are now acting in conjunction with the Britons , I know not how any man can affirm , unless he has received intelligence by some airy messengers , or has some sympathetick communication with them , not indulged to the rest of mankind .
None of the accounts which have been brought hither of the affairs of the continent have yet informed us of any action , or tendency to action  the Hanoverians have , indeed , been reviewed in conjunction with our forces , but have , hitherto , not acted  nor have the armies yet cemented the alliance by any common danger , or shown yet that they are friends otherwise than by sleeping and eating together , by eating at the expense of the same nation .


Nor am I at present inclined to grant , that either army is situated where it may be of most use to the queen of Hungary  for they now loiter in a country which no enemy threatens , and in which nothing , therefore , can be feared  a country very remote from the seat of war , and which will probably be last attacked .
If the assistance of the queen of Hungary had been designed , there appears no reason why the Hanoverians should have marched thither , or why this important conjunction should have been formed , since they might , in much less time , and with less expense , have joined the Austrians , and , perhaps , have enabled them to defeat the designs of the French , and cut off the retreat of the army which was sent to the relief of Prague .
But this march , though it would have been less tedious , would have been more dangerous , and would not have been very consistent with the designs of those who are more desirous of receiving wages than of deserving them  nor is it likely , that those who required levy-money for troops already levied , and who demanded that they should be paid a long time before they began to march , would hurry them to action , or endeavour to put a period to so gainful a trade as that of hiring troops which are not to be exposed .


This conduct , however visibly absurd , I am very far from imputing either to cowardice or ignorance  for there is reason to suspect , that they marched into Flanders only because they could not appear in any other place as the allies of the queen of Hungary , without exposing their sovereign to the imperial interdict .


It is , therefore , not only certain , that these troops , these boasted and important troops , have not yet been of any use  but probable , that no use is intended for them , and that the sole view of those who have introduced them into our service , is to pay their court by enriching Hanover with the spoils of Britain .


That this is in reality their intention , appears from the estimates to which an appeal has been so confidently made , but which , if they are compared with a contract made for the troops of the same nation in the last war , will show how much their price has risen since their sovereign was exalted to this throne  though I can not find any proof that their reputation has increased , nor can discover , from their actions in Flanders , any reason to believe that their services will be greater .


It is now to little purpose to inquire , whether there are any other troops that could have been more properly employed , since it is certain , that whatever may be the general character , or the late conduct of other nations , it is the interest of Britain to employ rather any troops than these , as any evil is rather to be chosen than animosities between our sovereign and our fellow-subjects  and such animosities must inevitably arise from this detestable preference of the troops of Hanover .


[ The question was carried by 67 , the Ayes being 260  Noes 193 .
This affair was again debated with vehemence upon the report on Monday , December 13 , 1742 , upon a question , whether the levy-money should stand part of the general question , which was carried by 53  Ayes 230 , Noes 177 . ]


HOUSE OF LORDS , FEBRUARY 1 , 1742-3 .


The order of the day for taking into consideration the several estimates of the charge of the forces in the pay of Great Britain was read , upon which lord STANHOPE rose up , and spoke in substance as follows : --


My lords , I have always understood , that the peculiar happiness of the British nation consists in this , that nothing of importance can be undertaken by the government , without the consent of the people as represented by the other house , and that of your lordships , whose large possessions , and the merits either of your ancestors or yourselves , have given you the privilege of voting in your own right in national consultations .


The advantages of this constitution , the security which it confers upon the nation , and the restraint which it lays upon corrupt ministers , or ambitious princes , are in themselves too obvious to admit of explanation , and too well known in this great assembly , by whose ancestors they were originally obtained , and preserved at the frequent hazard of life and fortune , for me to imagine , that I can make them either more esteemed or better understood .


My intention , my lords , is not to teach others the regard which the constitution of our government , or the happiness of the nation demands from them , but to show how much I regard them myself , by endeavouring to preserve and defend them at a time when I think them invaded and endangered .


Upon the examination of the estimates now before us , I can not but think it necessary , my lords , that every man who values liberty , should exert that spirit by which it was first established  that every man should rouse from his security , and awaken all his vigilance and all his zeal , lest the bold attempt that has been now made should , if it be not vigorously repressed , be an encouragement to the more dangerous encroachments  and lest that fabrick of power should be destroyed , which has been erected at such expense and with such labour  at which one generation has toiled after another , and of which the wisdom of the most experienced and penetrating statesmen have been employed to perfect its symmetry , and the industry of the most virtuous patriots to repair its decays .


The first object which the estimates force upon our observation is a numerous body of foreign troops , for the levy and payment of which a very large sum is demanded  and demanded at a time when the nation is to the last degree embarrassed and oppressed , when it is engaged in a war with a powerful empire , and almost overwhelmed with the debts that were contracted in former confederacies  when it is engaged in a war , not for the recovery of forgotten claims , or for the gratification of restless ambition , not for the consumption of exuberant wealth , or for the discharge of superfluous inhabitants  but a war , in which the most important interests are set to hazard , and by which the freedom of navigation must be either established or lost  a war which must determine the sovereignty of the ocean , the rights of commerce , and the state of our colonies  a war , in which we may , indeed , be victorious without any increase of our reputation  but in which we can not be defeated without losing all our influence upon foreign powers , and becoming subject to the insolence of petty princes .


When foreign troops are hired , at a time like this , it is natural to expect that they have been procured by contracts uncommonly frugal  because no nation can be supposed to be lavish in a time of distress .
It is natural , my lords , to expect that they should be employed in expeditions of the utmost importance  because no trifling advantage ought to incite a people overburdened with taxes , to oppress themselves with any new expense  and it may be justly supposed , that these troops were hired by the advice of the senate  because no minister can be supposed so hardened in defiance of his country , in contempt of the laws , and in disregard of the publick happiness , as to dare to introduce foreigners into the publick service , in prosecution of his own private schemes , or to rob the nation which he professes to serve , that he may increase the wealth of another .


But upon consideration of this estimate , my lords , all these expectations , however reasonable in themselves , however consistent with the declarations of the wisest statesmen , and the practice of former times , will be disappointed  for it will be found that the troops , of which we are now to ratify the provisions for their payment , are raised at an expense never known on the like occasion before , when the nation was far more able to support it  that they have yet been employed in no expedition , that they have neither fought a battle , nor besieged a town , nor undertaken any design , nor hindered any that has been formed by those against whom they are pretended to have been raised  that they have not yet drawn a sword but at a review , nor heard the report of fire-arms but upon a festival  that they have not yet seen an enemy , and that they are posted where no enemy is likely to approach them .


But this , my lords , is not the circumstance which ought , in my opinion , most strongly to affect us  troops may be raised without being employed , and money expended without effect  but such measures , though they ought to be censured and rectified , may be borne without any extraordinary degree of indignation .
While our constitution remains unviolated , temporary losses may be easily repaired , and accidental misconduct speedily retrieved  but when the publick rights are infringed , when the ministry assume the power of giving away the properties of the people , it is then necessary to exert an uncommon degree of vigour and resentment  it is as necessary to stop , the encroachments of lawless power , as to oppose the torrent of a deluge  which may be , perhaps , resisted at first , but from which , the country that is once overwhelmed by it , can not be recovered .


To raise this ardour , my lords , to excite this laudable resentment , I believe it will be only necessary to observe , that those troops were raised without the advice or the consent of the senate  that this new burden has been laid upon the nation by the despotick will of the ministers , and that the demands made for their support may be said to be a tax laid upon the people , not by the senate , but by the court .


The motives upon which the ministry have acted on this occasion are , so far as they can be discovered , and , indeed , there appears very little care to conceal them , such as no subject of this crown ever dared to proceed upon before  they are such as the act of settlement , that act to which our sovereign owes his title to this throne , ought for ever to have excluded from British councils .


I should proceed , my lords , to explain this new method of impoverishing our country , and endeavour to show the principles from which it arises , and the end which it must promote .
But some sudden indisposition obliges me to contract my plan , and conclude much sooner than I intended , with moving , `` that an humble address be presented to his majesty , to beseech and advise his majesty , that considering the excessive and grievous expenses , incurred by the great number of foreign troops now in the pay of Great Britain , ( expenses so increased by the extraordinary manner , as we apprehend , of making the estimates relating thereunto , and which do not appear to us conducive to the end proposed , ) his majesty will be graciously pleased , in compassion to his people , loaded already with such numerous and heavy taxes , such large and growing debts , and greater annual expenses than this nation , at any time , ever before sustained , to exonerate his subjects of the charge and burden of those mercenaries who were taken into our service last year , without the advice or consent of parliament . ''


Lord SANDWICH spoke next in support of the motion to the following effect : -- My lords , though I heard the noble lord with so much pleasure , that I could not but wish he had been able to deliver his sentiments more fully upon this important affair  yet I think the motion so reasonable and just , that though he might have set it yet more beyond the danger of opposition , though he might have produced many arguments in defence of it , which , perhaps , will not occur to any other lords  yet I shall be able to justify it in such a manner , as may secure the approbation of the unprejudiced and disinterested  and , therefore , I rise up to second it with that confidence , which always arises from a consciousness of honest intentions , and of an impartial inquiry after truth .


The measures , my lords , which have given occasion to this motion , have been for some time the subject of my reflections  I have endeavoured to examine them in their full extent , to recollect the previous occurrences by which the ministry might have been influenced to engage in them , and to discover the certain and the probable consequences which they may either immediately , or more remotely produce  I have laboured to collect from those who are supposed to be most acquainted with the state of Europe , and the scheme of British policy which is at present pursued , the arguments which can be offered in favour of these new engagements  and have compared them with the conduct of former ages upon the like occasions  but the result of all my searches into history , all my conversation with politicians of every party , and all my private meditations , has been only , that I am every hour confirmed , by some new evidence , in the opinion which I had first formed  and now imagined myself to know what I at first believed , that we are entangled in a labyrinth of which no end is to be seen , and in which no certain path has yet been discovered  that we are pursuing schemes which are in no degree necessary to the prosperity of our country , by means which are apparently contrary to law , to policy , and to justice  and that we are involved in a foreign quarrel only to waste that blood , and exhaust that treasure , which might be employed in recovering the rights of commerce , and regaining the dominion of the sea .


To prosecute the war against Spain with that vigour which interest and resentment might be expected to produce , to repress that insolence by which our navigation has been confined , and to punish that rapacity by which our merchants have been plundered , and that cruelty by which our fellow-subjects have been enslaved , tortured , and murdered , had been an attempt in which every honest man would readily have concurred , and to which all those who had sense to discern their own interest , or virtue to promote the publick happiness , would cheerfully have contributed , however loaded with taxes , oppressed with a standing army , and plundered by the vultures of a court : nor is the ancient spirit of the British nation so much depressed , but that when Spain had been subdued , when our rights had been publickly acknowledged , our losses repaired , and our colonies secured  when our ships had again sailed in security , and our flag awed the ocean of America , we might then have extended our views to foreign countries , might have assumed , once more , the guardianship of the liberties of Europe , have given law to the powers of the continent , and superintended the happiness of mankind .
But in the present situation of our affairs , when we have made war for years without advantage , while our most important rights are yet subject to the chance of battle , why we should engage in the defence of other princes more than our stipulations require , I am not able to discover  nor can I conceive what motive can incite us , after having suffered so much from a weak enemy to irritate a stronger .


To the measures which are now pursued , were there no other arguments to be alleged against them , I should think it , my lords , a sufficient objection that they are unnecessary , and that this is not a time for political experiments , or for wanton expenses .
I should think , that the present distresses of the publick ought to restrain your lordships from approving any steps by which our burdens may be made more heavy , burdens under which we are already sinking , and which a peace of more than twenty years has not contributed to lighten .


But that they are unnecessary , my lords , is the weakest allegation that can be offered  for they are such as tend not only to obstruct the advancement of more advantageous designs , but to bring upon us the heaviest calamities  they will not only hinder us from increasing our strength , but will sink us to the greatest degree of weakness  they will not only impoverish us for the present , which may be sometimes the effect of useful and beneficial designs , but may depress us below a possibility of recovery , and reduce us to receive laws from some foreign power .


This is , indeed , a dreadful prospect  but what other can arise to us from a war with France , with the most wealthy empire of the universe , of which we were sufficiently shown the strength in the late war , by the resistance which all the surrounding nations found it able to make against their united efforts , and which the debts that they then contracted , and the towns that were then destroyed , will not easily suffer them to forget .
Of this empire , my lords , thus powerful , thus formidable , neither the dominions are contracted , nor the trade impaired , nor the inhabitants diminished .
The French armies are no less numerous than under their late mighty monarch , their territories are increased by new acquisitions , their trade has long been promoted by the destruction of ours , and their wealth has been , by consequence , increased .
They have not , my lords , like this unhappy nation , been exhausted by temporary expedients and useless armaments  they have not harassed their merchants to aggrandize the court , nor thrown away the opportunities which this interval of quiet has afforded them , in the struggles of faction  they have not been multiplying officers to betray the people , and taxing the people to support their oppressors  but have with equal policy , diligence , and success , recovered the losses which they then sustained , and enabled themselves to make another stand against a general confederacy .


Against this empire , my lords , are we now to be engaged in a war , without trade , and without money , loaded with debts , and harassed with exactions  for what consequences can be expected from sending our troops into the frontier towns , but that the French will charge us with beginning hostilities , and declare war against us , or attack us without a declaration  and that we shall be obliged to stand alone against the whole power of the house of Bourbon , while all our ancient allies stand at a distance spiritless and intimidated , or , perhaps , secretly incite our enemies against us , in hopes of sharing our plunder , or of rising on our ruin .


I know it has been alleged , and alleged with such a degree of confidence , as it is reasonable to hope nothing could produce but a consciousness of truth , that the Dutch have already consented to assist us  nor is it without regret , that I find myself obliged to declare , that this assertion is nothing more than one of those transient visions with which it has been for a long time the custom of British ministers to delude the people , to pacify their clamours , and lull them in security  one of those artifices from which nothing more is expected , than that it shall operate upon the nation , till the circumstances of our affairs furnish out another , which is likewise , in a short time , to be exploded only to make way for new falsehoods in a perpetual succession .


Such , my lords , is the art of government discovered by the wonderful sagacity of modern statesmen  who have found out , that it is easier to palliate than to cure  and that the people maybe quieted by political soporificks , while diseases are preying upon them , while their strength decays , and their vitals are consumed .


That these falsehoods prevail upon mankind , and that after the discovery of one cheat , another equally gross is patiently borne , can not but raise the wonder of a man who views the world at a distance , and who has not opportunities of inquiring into the various motives of action or belief .
Such an one would be inclined to think us a nation of fools , that must be stilled with rattles , or amused with baubles  and would readily conclude , that our ministers were obliged to practise such fallacies , because they could not prevail upon us by motives adapted to reasonable beings .


But if we reflect , my lords , upon the different principles upon which reports like these are propagated and opposed , it will easily be discovered that their success is not to be imputed either to superiour art on one side , or uncommon weakness on the other .
It is well known that they are promoted by men hired for that purpose with large salaries , or beneficial employments , and that they can be opposed only from a desire of detecting falsehood , and advancing the publick happiness : it is apparent that those who invent , those who circulate , and , perhaps , part of those who counterfeit belief of them , are incited by the prospect of private advantage , and immediate profit  and that those who stop them in their career by contradiction and objections , can propose no other benefit to themselves , than that which they shall receive in common with every other member of the community  and , therefore , whoever has sufficiently observed mankind , to discover the reason for which self-interest has in almost all ages prevailed over publick spirit , will be able to see why reports like these are not always suppressed by seasonable detections .


A minister ought not to flatter himself that he has always deceived those who appear to credit his representations  their silence is not so often the effect of credulity , as of cowardice or indolence .
Many are overborne by the pomp of great offices , and others who distinguish more clearly , and judge with greater freedom , are contented to enjoy their own reflections , without reproving those whom they despair to reform .


This report of the engagement of the Dutch in our measures , shall , however , furnish our ministers with no opportunity of boasting their address , nor shall it pass any longer without contradiction  for I shall , without any scruple , affirm in the presence of this august assembly , that the Dutch have hitherto appeared absolutely neutral  that they have not shown any approbation of our measures , nor any inclination to assist us in them .
I know , my lords , how disagreeable this assertion may be to those , whose interest it is that mankind should believe them of no less importance in the eyes of foreign powers than in their own , and should imagine that the remotest nations of the world are influenced by their motions , and directed by their counsels  but however they may resent this declaration , I defy them to confute it , and now call upon them to show that the Dutch have engaged in any measure for the support of the queen of Hungary .


The late augmentation of twenty thousand men , which may possibly be mentioned as a proof of their intention , shows nothing but that they pursue their own interest with their usual prudence and attention , and with such as it is to be wished that our ministers would condescend to learn from them  and that they are too wise to suffer the towns from which the Austrians have , by our persuasions , withdrawn their troops to fall into the hands of the French .
They have , therefore , substituted new garrisons , but seem to have no regard to the interest of the queen of Hungary , nor any other view than that of providing for their own security , waiting the event of the war , and laying hold of any advantage that may accidentally be offered them .


It may be urged farther by those who are desirous to deceive others , or willing to be deceived themselves , that the province of Holland has passed a vote for assisting the queen of Hungary with twenty thousand men  but if it be remembered , my lords , that this must be the general act of the United States , and that every province has its own particular views to gratify , and its own interest to reconcile with the general good , it may be very reasonably suspected , that this assistance is yet rather the object of hope than expectation  it may justly be feared , that before so many various dispositions will unite , and such different schemes will be made consistent , the house of Austria may be extinguished , that our forces may be destroyed , and Germany enslaved by the French .
Then , my lords , what will remain , but that we shall curse that folly that involved us in distant quarrels , and that temerity which sent us out to oppose a power which we could not withstand  and which incited us to waste that treasure in foreign countries , which we may quickly want for the defence of our own ?


It must be , indeed , confessed , that if an estimate is to be made of our condition , from the conduct of our ministers , the fear of exhausting our treasure must be merely panick , and the precepts of frugality which other states have grown great by observing , are to be absolutely unnecessary .
It may reasonably be imagined that we have some secret mine , or hidden repository of gold , which no degree of extravagance can drain , and which may for ever supply the most lavish expenses without diminution .


For upon what other supposition , my lords , can any man attempt a defence of the contract , by which we have obtained for one campaign the service of the troops of Hanover ?
What but the confidence of funds that can never be deficient , could influence them to conclude a stipulation , by which levy-money is to be paid for troops of which not a single regiment was raised for our service , or on the present occasion  which were established for the security of the electorate of Hanover , and would have been maintained , though we had not engaged in the affairs of the continent .


What were the reasons which induced our ministry to employ the forces of Hanover , it is , perhaps , not necessary to inquire .
The only motive that ought to have influenced them , was the prospect of obtaining them upon cheap terms  for , my lords , if the troops of Hanover can not be obtained , but at the same expense with those of Britain , I am not able to discover why they should be preferred .
I have never heard , my lords , any uncommon instances of Hanoverian courage , that should incline us to trust the cause of Europe rather to that nation than to our own  and am inclined to believe , that Britain is able to produce men equal in all military virtues to any native of that happy country  a country which , though it was thought worthy to be secured by a neutrality , when all the neighbouring provinces were exposed to the ravages of war , I have never heard celebrated for any peculiar excellencies  and of which I can not but observe , that it was indebted for its security rather to the precaution of its prince , than the bravery of its inhabitants .


This demand of levy-money shocks every Briton yet more strongly , on considering by whom it is required  required by that family whom we have raised from a petty dominion , for which homage was paid to a superiour power  and which was , perhaps , only suffered to retain the appearance of a separate sovereignty , because it was not worth the labour and expense of an invasion  because it would neither increase riches nor titles , nor gratify either avarice or ambition  by a family whom , from want and weakness , we have exalted to a throne , from whence , with virtue equal to their power , they may issue their mandates to the remotest parts of the earth , may prescribe the course of war in distant empires , and dictate terms of peace to half the monarchs of the globe .


I should imagine , my lords , that when a king of the house of Hanover surveys his navies , reviews his troops , or examines his revenue , beholds the splendour of his court , or contemplates the extent of his dominions , he can not but sometimes , however unwillingly , compare his present state with that of his ancestors  and that when he gives audience to the ambassadours of princes , who , perhaps , never heard of Hanover , and directs the payment of sums , by the smallest of which all his ancient inheritance would be dearly purchased  and reflects , as surely he sometimes will , that all these honours and riches , this reverence from foreign powers , and his domestick splendour , are the gratuitous and voluntary gifts of the mighty people of Britain , he should find his heart overflowing with unlimited gratitude , and should be ready to sacrifice to the happiness of his benefactors , not only every petty interest , or accidental inclination , but even his repose , his safety , or his life  that he should be ready to ease them of every burden before they complained , and to aid them with all his power before they requested his assistance  that he should consider his little territories as only a contemptible province to his British empire , a kind of nursery for troops to be employed without harassing his more valuable subjects .


It might be at least hoped , my lords , that the princes of the house of Hanover might have the same regard to this nation as to kings from whom they never received any benefit , and whom they ought in reality always to have considered as enemies , yet even from such levy-money was not always required  or if required , was not always received .


There was once a time , my lords , before any of this race wore the crown of Britain  when the great French monarch , Lewis the fourteenth , being under a necessity of hiring auxiliary troops , applied to the duke of Hanover , as a prince whose necessities would naturally incline him to set the lives of his subjects at a cheap rate .
The duke , pleased with an opportunity of trafficking with so wealthy a monarch , readily promised a supply of troops  and demanded levy-money to be paid him , that he might be enabled to raise them .
But Hanoverian reputation was not then raised so high , as that the French king should trust him with his money .
Lewis suspected , and made no scruple of declaring his suspicion , that the demand of levy-money was only a pretence to obtain a sum which would never afterwards be repaid , and for which no troops would be obtained  and therefore , with his usual prudence insisted , that the troops should first march , and then be paid .
Thus for some time the treaty was at a stand  but the king being equally in want of men , as the duke of money , and perceiving , perhaps , that it was really impracticable for so indigent a prince to raise troops without some pecuniary assistance , offered him at length a small sum , which was gladly accepted , though much below the original demand .
The troops were engaged in the service of France  and the duke of Hanover thought himself happy in being able to amuse himself at his leisure with the rattle of money .


Such , my lords , were the conditions on which the troops of Hanover were furnished in former times  and surely what could then be produced by the love of money , or the awe of a superiour power , might now be expected as the effect of gratitude and kindness .


But not to dwell any longer , my lords , upon particular circumstances of measures , of which the whole scheme is contrary to the apparent interest of this empire , I shall not inquire farther , why auxiliaries are employed on this occasion rather than Britons , rather than those whose bravery is celebrated to the most distant corners of the earth  why , if mercenaries are necessary , those of Hanover are preferred to others : or why , if they are , indeed , preferable , they are now to be hired at a higher rate than at any former time ?
It appears to me of far more importance to undermine the foundation , than to batter the superstructure of our present system of politicks  and of greater use to inquire , why we have engaged in a war on the continent , than why we carry it on with ridiculous profusion .


It appears to me , my lords , that there are many reasons which , with the same circumstances , would have withheld any nation but this from such a dangerous interposition .
The Dutch , we see , are content to look on without action , though they are more interested in the event , and less embarrassed on any other side .
We are already engaged in a war , of which no man can foresee the conclusion  but which can not be ended unsuccessfully , without the utmost danger to our most important interests  and which yet has hitherto produced only losses and disgrace , has impoverished our merchants , and intimidated our soldiers .
Whether these losses are the effects of weakness or treachery , is a question which I am not ambitious of endeavouring to decide , and of which the decision is , indeed , by no means necessary in the present debate  since if we are too weak to struggle with Spain , unassisted as she is , and embarrassed with different views , I need not say what will be our condition , when the whole house of Bourbon shall be combined against us  when that nation which stood alone for so many years against the united efforts of Europe , shall attack us , exhausted with taxes , enervated with corruption , and disunited from all allies .
Whether the troops of Hanover will assist us at that time , I can not determine .
Perhaps , in the destruction of the British dominions , it may be thought expedient to secure a more valuable and important country by a timely neutrality  but if we have any auxiliaries from thence , we must then necessarily obtain them upon cheaper terms .


If our inactivity in the European seas , and our ill success in those of America be , as it is generally suspected , the consequence of perfidious counsels , and private machinations  if our fleets are sent out with orders to make no attempt against our enemies , or our admirals commanded to retreat before them  surely no higher degree of madness can be imagined , than that of provoking new enemies before we have experienced a change of counsels , and found reason to place in our ministers and statesmen that confidence which war absolutely requires .


This is the conduct , my lords , which I should think most rational , even though we were attacked in some of our real rights , and though the quarrel about which we were debating was our own  I should think the nearest danger the greatest , and should advise patience under foreign insults , till we had redressed our domestick grievances  till we had driven treachery from the court , and corruption from the senate .
But much more proper do I think this conduct , when we are invited only to engage in distant war , in a dispute about the dominion of princes , in the bowels of the continent  of princes , of whom it is not certain , that we shall receive either advantage or security from their greatness , or that we should suffer any loss or injury by their fall .


But , my lords , I know it will be answered , that the queen of Hungary has a right by treaty to our assistance  and that in becoming guarantees of the Pragmatick sanction , we engaged to support her in the dominions of her ancestors .
This , my lords , is an answer of which I do not deny the justness , and of which I will not attempt to invalidate the strength .
I allow that such a stipulation was made , and that treaties ought to be observed , at whatever hazard , with unviolated faith .
It has been , indeed , objected , that many nations engaged with us in the same treaty , whom interest or cowardice have inclined to neglect it  and that we ought not to become the standing garrison of Europe , or to defend alone those territories , to the preservation of which so many states are obliged to contribute equally with ourselves .
But this , my lords , appears to me an argument of which the ill consequences can never be fully discovered  an argument which dissolves all the obligations of contracts , destroys the foundation of moral justice , and lays society open to all the mischiefs of perfidy , by making the validity of oaths and contracts dependant upon chance , and regulating the duties of one man by the conduct of another .
I pretend not , my lords , to long experience , and , therefore , in discussing intricate questions , may be easily mistaken .
But as , in my opinion , my lords , morality is seldom difficult , but when it is clouded with an intention to deceive others or ourselves , I shall venture to declare with more confidence , that in proportion as one man neglects his duty , another is more strictly obliged to practise his own , that his example may not help forward the general corruption , and that those who are injured by the perfidy of others , may from his sincerity have a prospect of relief .


I believe all politicks that are not founded on morality will be found fallacious and destructive , if not immediately , to those who practise them  yet , consequentially , by their general tendency to disturb society , and weaken those obligations which maintain the order of the world .
I shall , therefore , allow , that what justice requires from a private man , becomes , in parallel circumstances , the duty of a nation  and shall , therefore , never advise the violation of a solemn treaty .
The stipulations in which we engaged , when we became guarantees of the Pragmatick sanction , are , doubtless , to be observed  and it is , therefore , one of the strongest objections against the measures which we are now pursuing , that we shall be perfidious at a greater expense than fidelity would have required , and shall exhaust the treasure of the nation without assisting the queen of Hungary .


To explain this assertion , my lords , it is necessary to take a view of the constitution of the German body , which consists of a great number of separate governments independent on each other , but subject , in some degree , to the emperour as the general head .
The subjects of each state are governed by their prince , and owe no allegiance to any other sovereign  but the prince performs homage to the emperour , and having thereby acknowledged himself his feudatory , or dependant , may be punished for rebellion against him .
The title of the emperour , and consequently his claim to this allegiance , and the right of issuing the ban against those who shall refuse it , is confirmed by many solemn acknowledgments of the diet , and , amongst others , by the grant of a pecuniary aid  this the present emperour has indisputably received , an aid having been already granted him in the diet , of a subsidy for eighteen months  and , therefore , none of the troops of Germany can now be employed against him , without subjecting the prince to whom they belong to the censure of the ban , a kind of civil excommunication .


To what purpose , then , my lords , are we to hire , at a rate never paid , or perhaps demanded before , troops which can not serve us without subjecting their prince to the charge of rebellion ?
Or how shall we assist the queen of Hungary , by collecting forces which dare not act against the only enemy which she has now to fear ?
Or in what new difficulties shall we be engaged , should the inestimable dominions of Hanover be subjected to the imperial interdiction .


These , my lords , are questions to which , I hope , we shall hear a more satisfactory answer than I am able to conceive  for , indeed , I do not see what remains , but to confess , that these troops are hired only for a military show , to amuse this nation with a false appearance of zeal for the preservation of Europe , and to increase the treasures of Hanover at the expense of Britain .


These are designs , my lords , which no man will avow , and yet these are the only designs which I can yet discover  and , therefore , I shall oppose all the measures that tend to their execution .
If the heat of indignation , or the asperity of resentment , or the wantonness of contempt , have betrayed me into any expressions unworthy of the dignity of this house , I hope they will be forgiven by your lordships  for any other degree of freedom I shall make no apology , having , as a peer , a right to deliver my opinion , and as a Briton , to assert the independence of my native country , when I see , or imagine myself to see , that it is ignominiously and illegally subjected to the promotion of the petty interest of the province of Hanover .


Lord CARTERET then rose , and made answer to the following effect : -- My lords , as I doubt not but I shall be able to justify the measures which are now pursued , in such a manner as may entitle them to the approbation of your lordships , I proposed to hear all the objections that should be made , before I attempted a vindication , that the debate might be shortened , and that the arguments on both sides might be considered as placed in the full strength of opposition  and that it might be discerned how objections , however specious in themselves , would vanish before the light of reason and truth .


But the noble lord has made it necessary for me to alter my design , by a speech which I will not applaud , because it has , in my opinion , an ill tendency  nor censure , because it wanted neither the splendour of eloquence , nor the arts of reasoning  and had no other defect than that which must always be produced by a bad cause , fallacy in the arguments , and errours in the assertions .


This speech I am obliged to answer , because his lordship has been pleased to call out for any lord who will assert , that the Dutch have agreed to concur with us in assisting the queen of Hungary .
That all the provinces of that republick have agreed to assist us , is indeed not true  nor do I know , my lords , by whom or upon what authority it was asserted  but the concurrence of the province of Holland , the most important of all , and whose example the rest seldom delay to follow , has been obtained , which is sufficient to encourage us to vigorous resolutions , by which the rest may be animated to a speedy compliance .


The concurrence of this province has been already the consequence of the measures which have been lately pursued  measures from which , though just and successful , the ministry can not claim much applause  because all choice was denied , and they were obliged either to remain passive spectators of the ruin of Europe , and , by consequence , of Britain , or to do what they have done .
And surely , my lords , that necessity which deprives them of all claim to panegyrick , will be , likewise , a sufficient security from censure .
There is , indeed , no reason to fear censure from judges so candid and experienced as your lordships , to whom it may without difficulty be proved , that the balance of Europe has already changed its position , and the house of Bourbon is now not able to preponderate against the other powers .


By entering into an alliance with Sardinia , we have taken from the crown of Spain all the weight of the territories of Italy , of which the Austrian forces are now in possession , without fear or danger of being interrupted  while the passes of the ocean are shut by the fleets of Britain , and those of the mountains by the troops of Sardinia .


Those unhappy forces which were transported by the Spanish fleet , are not only lost to their native country , but exposed without provision , without ammunition , without retreat , and without hope : nor can any human prospect discover how they can escape destruction , either by the fatigue of marches , or the want of necessaries , or the superiour force of an army well supplied and elated with success .


This , my lords , is an embarrassment from which the Spaniards would gladly be freed at any expense , from which they would bribe us to relieve them , by permitting the demolition of new fortresses , or restoring the army which we lost at Carthagena .


Of this alliance the queen of Hungary already finds the advantage , as it preserves countries in her possession , which , if once lost , it might be impossible to recover  and sets her free from the necessity of dividing her army for the protection of distant territories .


Thus , my lords , the Spaniards are obstructed and distrusted  of their armies , one is condemned to waste away at the feet of impassable mountains , only to hear of the destruction of their countrymen whom they are endeavouring to relieve , and the establishment of peace in these regions of which they had projected the conquest  and the other , yet more unfortunate , has been successfully transported , only to see that fleet which permitted their passage preclude their supplies , and hinder their retreat .


Nor do we , my lords , after having thus efficaciously opposed one of the princes of the house of Bourbon , fear or shun the resentment of the other  we doubt not to show , that Britain is still able to retard the arms of the haughty French , and to drive them back from the invasion of other kingdoms to the defence of their own .
The time is at hand , my lords , in which it will appear , that however the power of France has been exaggerated , with whatever servility her protection has been courted , and with whatever meanness her insolence has been borne , this nation has not yet lost its influence or its strength , that it is yet able to fill the continent with armies , to afford protection to its allies , and strike terrour into those who have hitherto trampled under foot the faith of treaties and rights of sovereigns , and ranged over the dominions of the neighbouring princes , with the security of lawful possessors , and the pride of conquerors .


It has been objected by the noble lord , that this change is not to be expected from an army composed of auxiliary troops from any of the provinces of the German empire , because they can not act against the general head .
I can easily , my lords , solve this difficulty , from my long acquaintance with the constitution of the empire , which I understood before the noble lord , who has entertained you with a discourse upon it , was in being  but I will not engross your time , or retard your determination by a superfluous disquisition , which may be now safely omitted  since I am allowed by his majesty to assure your lordships , that the Hessian and Hanoverian troops shall be employed in assisting the queen of Hungary , and that they have already received orders to make the preparations necessary for marching into the empire .


After this declaration , my lords , the most formidable objection against the present measures will , I hope , be no more heard in this debate  for it will be by no means proper for any lord to renew it by inquiring , whether his majesty 's resolution is not a breach of the imperial constitution , or whether it will not expose his electoral dominions to danger .
For it is not our province to judge of the laws of other nations , to examine when they are violated , or to enforce the observation of them  nor is it necessary , since the interests of Britain and Hanover are irreconcilably opposite , to endeavour the preservation of dominions which their own sovereign is inclined to hazard .


Thus , my lords , I hope it appears , that the common interest of Britain and Europe is steadily pursued  that the Spaniards feel the effects of a war with Britain by their distress and embarrassment  that the queen of Hungary discovers , that the ancient allies of her family have not deserted her  and that France , amidst her boasts and her projects , perceives the determined opposers of her grandeur again setting her at defiance .


The duke of BEDFORD spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , the assurance which the noble lord who spoke last declares himself to have conceived of being able to demonstrate the propriety of the present measures , must surely arise from some intelligence which has been hitherto suppressed , or some knowledge of future events peculiar to himself  for I can not discover any force in the arguments which he has been pleased to use , that could produce in him such confidence of success , nor any circumstances in the present appearance of Europe , that do not seem to demand a different conduct .


The reasonableness of our measures at this time , as at all others , must be evinced by arguments drawn from an attentive review of the state of our own country , compared with that of the neighbouring nations  for no man will deny , that those methods of proceeding which are at one time useful , may at another be pernicious  and that either a gradual rotation of power , or a casual variation of interest , may very properly produce changes in the counsels of the most steady and vigorous administration .


It is therefore proper , in the examination of this question , to consider what is the state of our own nation , and what is to be hoped or feared from the condition of those kingdoms , which are most enabled by their situation to benefit or to hurt us : and in inquiry , my lords , an inquiry that can give little pleasure to an honest and benevolent mind , it immediately occurs , that we are a nation exhausted by a long war , and impoverished by the diminution of our commerce  and the result , therefore , of this first consideration is , that those measures are most eligible which are most frugal  and that to waste the publick treasure in unnecessary expenses , or to load the people with new taxes only to display a mockery of war on the continent , or to amuse ourselves , our allies , or our enemies , with the idle ostentation of unnecessary numbers , is to drain from the nation the last remains of its ancient vigour , instead of assisting its recovery from its present languors .


But money , however valuable , however necessary , has sometimes been imprudently and unseasonably spared  and an ill-timed parsimony has been known to hasten calamities , by which those have been deprived of all who would not endeavour to preserve it by the loss of part .
It is therefore to be considered , whether measures less expensive would not have been more dangerous  and whether we have not , by hiring foreign troops , though at a very high rate , at a rate which would have been demanded from no other nation , purchased an exemption from distresses , insults , and invasions .


The only nations , my lords , whom we have any reason to suspect of a design to invade us , or that have power to put any such design in execution , are well known to be the French and Spaniards  from these , indeed , it may justly be expected , that they will omit no opportunity of gratifying that hatred which difference of religion and contrariety of interest can not fail to continue from age to age  and therefore we ought never to imagine ourselves safe , while it is in their power to endanger us .
But of these two nations , my lords , the one is already disarmed by the navies of Britain , which confine her fleets to their harbours , and , as we have been just now informed , preclude her armies from supplies : the other is without a fleet able to transport an army , her troops are dispersed in different countries , and her treasures exhausted by expeditions or negotiations equally expensive .


There is , therefore , my lords , no danger of an invasion , even though we had no forces by which it could be opposed  but much less is it to be feared , when it is remembered , that the sea is covered with our ships of war , and that all the coasts of Europe are awed and alarmed by the navies of Britain .


This then , my lords , is surely the time , when we ought not to have sacrificed any immediate and apparent interest to the fear of attempts from Spain or France  when we might without danger have assisted our allies with our national troops , and have spared that money which we have so lavishly bestowed upon auxiliaries  when we might securely have shown the powers of the continent how much the British valour is yet to be feared , and how little our late losses or disgraces are to be imputed to the decline of our courage or our strength .


I suppose , my lords , no man will confess , that foreign troops have been hired as more to be trusted for their skill or bravery than our own .
To dispute the palm of courage with any nation would be a reproach to the British name  and if our soldiers are not at least equally disciplined with those of other countries , it must be owned , that taxes have been long paid to little purpose , that the glitter of reviews has been justly ridiculed as an empty show , and that we have long been flattered by our ministers and generals with false security .


But though I am far from believing , that the army has been supported only for the defence of our country  and though I know , that their officers are frequently engaged in employments more important in the opinion of their directors , than that of regulating the discipline of their regiments , and teaching the use of arms and the science of war  yet , as I believe the courage of Britons such as may often supply the want of skill , I can not but conclude , that they are at least as formidable as the troops of other countries , especially when I remember , that they enter the field incited and supported by the reputation of their country .


Why then , my lords , is the nation condemned to support , at once , a double burden  to pay at home an army which can be of no use , and to hire auxiliaries , perhaps , equally unactive  to make war , if any war be intended , at an unnecessary expense , and to pay , at once , a fleet which only floats upon the ocean , an army which only awes the villages from which it is supported , and a body of mercenaries , of which no man can yet conjecture with what design they have been retained .


That they are intended for the support of the queen of Hungary has been , indeed , asserted  and this contract has been produced as an instance of the zeal of our ministers for the assertion of the Pragmatick sanction , the preservation of the liberties of Europe , and the suppression of the ambitious enterprises of the house of Bourbon  but surely , my lords , had the assistance of that illustrious princess been their sole or principal intention , had they in reality dedicated the sum which is to be received by the troops of Hanover , to the sacred cause of publick faith and universal liberty , they might have found methods of promoting it much more efficaciously at no greater expense .
Had they remitted that money to the queen , she would have been enabled to call nations to her standard , to fill the plains of Germany with the hardy inhabitants of the mountains and the deserts , and have deluged the empire of France with multitudes equally daring and rapacious , who would have descended upon a fruitful country like vultures on their prey , and have laid those provinces in ruin which now smile at the devastation of neighbouring countries , secure in the protection of their mighty monarch .


By this method of carrying on the war , we might have secured our ally from danger which I can not but think imminent and formidable , though it seems , at present , not to be feared .
By so large an addition to her troops , she would have been enabled to frustrate those designs , which her success may incline the king of Prussia to form against her  for with whatever tranquillity he may now seem to look upon this general commotion , his conduct gives us no reason to imagine , that he has changed his maxims , that he is now forgetful or negligent of his own interest , or that he will not snatch the first opportunity of aggrandizing himself by new pretensions to the queen of Hungary 's dominions .


At least , my lords , it may without scruple be asserted , that the hopes which some either form or affect of engaging him in a confederacy for the support of the Pragmatick sanction , are merely chimerical .
He who has hitherto considered no interest but his own , he who has perhaps endangered himself by attempting to weaken the only power to which he , as well as the other princes of the empire , can have recourse for protection from the ambition of France , and has , therefore , broken the rules of policy only to gratify a favourite passion , will scarcely concur in the exaltation of that family which he has so lately endeavoured to depress , and which he has so much exasperated against him .
If he is at length , my lords , alarmed at the ambition of the house of Bourbon , and has learned not to facilitate those designs which are in reality formed against himself , it can not be doubted , that he looks with equal fear on the house of Austria , that he knows his safety to consist only in the weakness of both , and that in any contest between them , the utmost that can be hoped from him is neutrality .


But , my lords , he whose security depends only on a supposition that men will not deviate from right reason or true policy , is in a state which can afford him very little tranquillity or confidence : whatever is necessarily to be preserved , ought to be defended , not only from certain and constant danger , but from casual and possible injuries  and amongst the rest , from those which may proceed from the mutability of will , or the depravation of understanding  nor shall we sufficiently establish the house of Austria , if we leave it liable to be shaken whenever the king of Prussia shall feel his ambition rekindled , or his malevolence excited  we must not leave it dependant on the friendship or policy of the neighbouring powers , but must enable it once more to awe the empire , and set at defiance the malice of its enemies .


This , my lords , might have been done by a liberal subsidy , by which armies might have been levied , garrisons established , and cities fortified  and why any other method was pursued , what reason can be assigned ?
what , but an inclination to aggrandize and enrich a contemptible province , and to deck with the plunder of Britain the electorate of Hanover ?


It has been suspected , my lords , ( nor has the suspicion been without foundation , ) that our measures have long been regulated by the interest of his majesty 's electoral territories  these have been long considered as a gulf into which the treasures of this nation have been thrown  and it has been observed , that the state of the country has , since the accession of its princes to this throne , been changed without any visible cause  affluence has begun to wanton in their towns , and gold to glitter in their cottages , without the discovery of mines , or the increase of their trade  and new dominions have been purchased , of which it can scarcely be imagined , that the value was paid out of the revenues of Hanover .


This , my lords , is unpopular , illegal , and unjust  yet this might be borne , in consideration of great advantages , of the protection of our trade , and the support of our honour .
But there are men who dare to whisper , and who , perhaps , if their suspicions receive new confirmation , will publickly declare , that for the preservation of Hanover , our commerce has been neglected , and our honour impaired  that to secure Hanover from invasion , the house of Bourbon has been courted , and the family of Austria embarrassed and depressed .
These men assert , without hesitation , that when we entered into a league with France against the emperour and the Spaniards , in the reign of the late emperour , no part of the British dominions were in danger  and that the alarm which was raised to reconcile the nation to measures so contrary to those which former ages had pursued , was a fictitious detestable artifice of wicked policy , by which Britain was engaged in the defence of dominions to which we owe no regard , as we can receive no real advantage from them .


It were to be wished , that no late instance could be produced of conduct regulated by the same principles  and that this shameful , this pernicious partiality had been universally allowed to have ceased with the late reign  but it has never yet been shown , that the late neutrality , by which Hanover was preserved , did not restrain the arms of Britain  nor when it has been asked , why the Spanish army was , when within reach of the cannon of the British navy , peaceably transported to Italy , has any other reason been assigned , than that the transports could not be destroyed without a breach of the neutrality of Hanover ?


This , my lords , is a subject on which I could have only been induced to dwell , by my zeal for the present establishment , and my personal affection for his majesty .
It is universally allowed , that not only the honour and prosperity , but the safety of a British monarch , depends upon the affections of his subjects  and that neither splendid levees , nor large revenues , nor standing armies , can secure his happiness or his power any longer than the people are convinced of his tenderness and regard , of his attention to their complaints , and his zeal for their interest .
If , therefore , it should ever be generally believed , that our king considers this nation only as appendent to his electoral dominions , that he promotes the interest of his former subjects at the expense of those by whom he has been exalted to this awful throne , and that our commerce , our treasures , and our lives , are sacrificed to the safety , or to the enlargement of distant territories , what can be expected ?
what but murmurs , disaffection , and distrust , and their natural consequences , insurrection and rebellion  rebellion , of which no man can foresee the event , and by which that man may perhaps be placed upon the throne , whom we have so wisely excluded and so solemnly abjured .


Of this unreasonable regard to the interest of Hanover , the contract which we are now considering exhibits , if not a proof too apparent to be denied , yet such an appearance as we ought for our own sakes and that of his majesty to obviate  and therefore I think the , address which is now proposed in the highest degree reasonable  and am convinced , that by complying with our request , his majesty will regain the affections of many of his subjects , whom a long train of pernicious measures have filled with discontent  and preserve the loyalty of many others , who , by artful representations of the motives and consequences of this contract , may be alienated and perverted .


Lord BATHURST replied to the following purport : -- My lords , as I have no reason to doubt of the noble duke 's affection to the present royal family , I am convinced , that the ardour of his expressions is the effect of his zeal , and that the force of his representations proceeds only from the strength of his conviction  and , therefore , I am far from intending to censure any accidental negligence of language , or any seeming asperity of sentiment .
I know , that the openness and dignity of mind which has incited him to declare his opinion with so much freedom , will induce him likewise to retract it , when he shall be convinced , that he has been deceived by false representations , or that he has formed his conclusions too hastily , without an attentive examination of the question in its whole extent .


I shall , therefore , endeavour to explain the motives upon which all these measures have been formed which we have heard so warmly censured  and show , that they were the consequences not of haste and negligence , but of vigilance and circumspection  that they were formed upon a deliberate survey of the complicated interests of the European powers , and dictated not by a partiality to Hanover , but a faithful attention to the interest of Britain .


It has been already observed by a noble lord , that there was no choice allowed us  that the state of Europe required that we should not sit unactive  and that yet there was no other method of acting , by which we could benefit our allies , or injure our enemies  and that , therefore , though our interposition had not produced all the effects which our zeal might incline us to wish , yet our conduct ought not to be condemned  because , though we did not press forward through the nearest path to the great object of our pursuit , we exerted our utmost speed in the only way that was left open .
This , my lords , is , in my opinion , a very just apology  nor do I see , that this vindication can be confuted or invalidated , otherwise than by showing , that some different measures , measures equally reasonable , were equally in our power .


But because the plea of necessity may , perhaps , be evaded  and because it is , at least , pleasing to discover , that what was necessary was likewise convenient , I shall endeavour to show , that our measures have produced already such effects as have sufficiently rewarded our expenses  and that we may yet reasonably hope , that greater advantages will arise from them .


There are , indeed , some whom it will not be easy to satisfy , some who declare not against the manner in which the war is prosecuted , but against the war itself  who think the power of France too formidable to be opposed , and the British people too much exhausted or enervated to hold any longer the balance of the continent .


I have , indeed , my lords , always declared myself of a different opinion , and have frequently endeavoured to rouse others from a kind of indolent despair and tame acquiescence in the attempts of the French , by representations of the wealth and force , the influence and alliances of our own nation .
I have often asserted , that I did not doubt but her conquests might be stopped by vigorous opposition , and that the current of her power , which had by artificial machines of policy been raised higher than its source , would subside and stagnate , when its course was no longer assisted by cowardice , and its way levelled by submission .


These , my lords , were my sentiments , and this was my language , at a time when all the powers of Europe conspired to flatter the pride of France by falling at her feet , when her nod was solicitously watched by all the princes of the empire , when there was no safety but by her protection , nor any enterprise but by her permission  when her wealth influenced the councils of nations , when war was declared at her command in the remotest corners of Europe , and every contest was submitted to her arbitration .


Even at this time , my lords , was I sufficiently confident of the power of my own country , to set at defiance , in my own mind , this gigantick state .
I considered all additions to its greatness rather as the tumour of disease than the shootings of vigour , and thought that its nerves grew weaker as its corpulence increased .
Of my own nation I saw , that neither its numbers nor its courage were diminished  I had no reason to believe our soldiers or our sailors less brave than their fathers  and , therefore , imagined that whenever they should be led out against the same enemies , they would fight with the same superiority and the same success .


But for these hopes , my lords , I was sometimes pitied by those who thought themselves better acquainted with the state of Europe than myself , and sometimes ridiculed by those who had been long accustomed to depress their own country , and to represent Britain as only the shadow of what it once was  to deride our armies and our fleets , and describe us impoverished and corrupted , sunk into cowardice , and delighted with slavery .


That my opinion is now likely to be justified , and that those who have hitherto so confidently opposed me , will soon be obliged to acknowledge their mistake , is of very small importance  nor is my self-love so predominant as to incline me to reckon the confirmation of my predictions , or the vindication of my sagacity among the benefits which we are now about to receive .
We are now soon to be convinced that France is not irresistible , nor irresistible to Britain .
We are now to see the embroilers of the universe entangled in their own schemes , and the depopulators of kingdoms destroyed in those fields which they have so wantonly laid waste .
We shall see justice triumphant over oppression , and insolence trampled by those whom she has despised .
We shall see the powers of Europe once more equally balanced , and the balance placed again in the hands of Britain .


If it be required upon what events these expectations are founded  and if it be alleged , that we have no such resolutions to hope from the measures that have been hitherto pursued  it has been affirmed by a noble lord , that our armies in Flanders are useless , and that our motions have given neither courage nor strength to any other powers  that the queen of Hungary is yet equally distressed , and that the French still pursue their schemes without any interruption from us or our allies , I shall hope by an impartial account of the present state of the continent to show , that his assertions are groundless , and his opinion erroneous .


The inactivity of our army in Flanders has , indeed , furnished a popular topick of declamation and ridicule .
It is well known how little the bulk of mankind are acquainted , either with arts of policy , or of war  how imperfectly they must always understand the conduct of ministers or generals , and with what partiality they always determine in favour of their own nation .
Ignorance , my lords , conjoined with partiality , must always produce expectations which no address nor courage can gratify  and it is scarcely , therefore , to be hoped , that the people will be satisfied with any account of the conduct of our generals , which does not inform them of sieges and battles , slaughter and devastation .
They expect that a British army should overrun the continent in a summer , that towns should surrender at their summons , and legions retire at their shout  that they should drive nations before them , and conquer empires by marching over them .


Such , my lords , are the effects which the people of Britain expect  and as they have hitherto been disappointed , their disappointment inclines them to complain .
They think an army useless which gains no victories , and ask to what purpose the sword is drawn , if the blood of their enemies is not to be shed ?
But these are not the sentiments of your lordships , whose acquaintance with publick affairs informs you , that victories are often gained where no standards are taken , nor newspapers filled with lists of the slain  and that by drawing the sword opportunely , the necessity of striking is often prevented .
You know , that the army which hovers over a country , and draws the forces which defend it to one part , may destroy it without invading it , by exposing it to the invasion of another  and that he who withholds an army from action , is not less useful to his ally than he that defeats it .


This , my lords , is the present use of our troops in Flanders  the French are kept in continual terrour , and are obliged to detach to that frontier those troops which , had they not been thus diverted , would have been employed in the empire  and , surely , an army is not unactive which withholds a double number from prosecuting their design .


That our motions have not encouraged other powers to fulfil their engagements , or to unite in the defence of the general liberty of Europe , can not truly be asserted .
The Dutch apparently waken from their slumber  whether it was real or affected , they at least discover less fear of the French , and have already given such proofs of their inclination to join with us , as may encourage us to expect , that they will , in a short time , form with us another confederacy , and employ their utmost efforts in the common cause .


What they have already offered will at least enable us to assist the queen of Hungary with greater numbers , and her to employ her troops where she is most pressed  for they have engaged to garrison the towns of Flanders , which , since they can not be evacuated , is in effect an offer of auxiliary troops  since , if those forces had been added to the Austrian army , an equal number of Austrians must have been subducted to garrison the frontier .


It is , therefore , without reason , that narrow-minded censurers charge us with becoming the slaves of the Dutch , with fighting their battles and defending their barrier , while they pursue their commerce in tranquillity , enjoy peace at the expense of British blood , and grow rich by the profusion of British treasure .
It appears , that they concur in the preservation of themselves and of Europe , though with delays and caution  since , though they do not send forces into the field , they supply the place of those which are sent , and enable others to destroy those whom they are not yet persuaded to attack themselves .


The constitution of that republick is , indeed , such as makes its alliance not valuable , on sudden emergencies , in proportion to its wealth and power .
The determinations of large assemblies are always slow  because there are many opinions to be examined , many proposals to be balanced , and many objections to be answered .
But with much more difficulty must any important resolution be formed , where it must be the joint act of the whole assembly , where every individual has a negative voice , and unanimity alone can make a decision obligatory .
Wherever this is the form of government , the state lies at the mercy of every man who has a vote in its councils  and the corruption or folly or obstinacy of one may retard or defeat the most important designs , lay his country open to the inroads of an enemy , dissolve the most solemn alliances , and involve a nation in misery .


This , my lords , I need not observe to be the Dutch constitution , nor need I tell this assembly , that we are not always to judge of the general inclination of that people by the procedure of their deputies , since particular men may be influenced by private views , or corrupted by secret promises or bribes  and those designs may be retarded by their artifices which the honest and impartial universally approve .
This is , perhaps , the true reason of the present delays which have furnished occasion to such loud complaints , complaints of which we may hope quickly to have an end  since it can hardly be doubted , but the general voice of the people will there , as in other places , at last prevail , and the prejudices or passions of private men give way to the interest of the publick .


That the queen of Hungary is now equally distressed , and that she has received no advantage from the assistance , which we have , at so great an expense , appeared to give her , is , likewise , very far from being true .
Let any man compare her present condition with that in which she was before Britain engaged in her cause , and it will easily be perceived how much she owes to the alliance of this nation .
She was then flying before her enemies , and reduced to seek for shelter in the remotest part of her dominions , while her capital was fortified in expectation of a siege .
Those who then were distributing her provinces , and who almost hovered over her only remaining kingdom , are now retiring before her troops .
The army by which it was intended that her territories in Italy should be taken from her , is now starving in the countries which it presumed to invade  and the troops which were sent to its assistance are languishing at the feet of mountains which they will never pass .


These are the effects , my lords , of those measures , which , for want of being completely understood , or attentively considered , have been so vehemently censured .
These measures , my lords , however injudicious , however unseasonable , have embarrassed the designs of France , and given relief to the queen of Hungary  they have animated the Dutch to action , and kindled in all the powers of Europe , who were intimidated by the French armies , new hopes and new resolutions  they have , indeed , made a general change in the state of Europe , and given a new inclination to the balance of power .
Not many months have elapsed , since every man appeared to consider the sovereign of France as the universal monarch , whose will was not to be opposed , and whose force was not to be resisted .
We now see his menaces despised and his propositions rejected  every one now appears to hope rather than to fear , though lately a general panick was spread over this part of the globe , and fear had so engrossed mankind , that scarcely any man presumed to hope .


But it is objected , my lords , that though our measures should be allowed not to have been wholly ineffectual , and our money appear not to have been squandered only to pay the troops of Hanover , yet our conduct is very far from meriting either applause or approbation  since much greater advantages might have been purchased at much less expense , and by methods much less invidious and dangerous .


The queen of Hungary might , in the opinion of these censurers , have raised an hundred thousand men with the money which we must expend in hiring only sixteen thousand , and might have destroyed those enemies whom we have hitherto not dared to attack .


Those who make this supposition the foundation of their censures , appear not to remember , that the queen of Hungary 's dominions , like those of other princes , may , by war , be in time exhausted  that the loss of inhabitants is not repaired in any country but by slow degrees  and that there is no place yet discovered where money will procure soldiers without end , or where new harvests of men rise up annually , ready to fight those quarrels in which their predecessors were swept away .
If the money had , instead of being employed in hiring auxiliaries , been remitted to the queen , it is not probable that she could , at any rate , have brought a new army together .
But it is certain , that her new troops must have been without arms and without discipline .
It might have been found , perhaps , in this general disturbance of the world , not easy to have supplied them with weapons  and it is well known how long time is required to teach raw forces the art of war , and enable them to stand before a veteran enemy .


It was , therefore , necessary to assist her rather with troops than money  and since troops were necessarily to be hired , why should we employ the forces of Hanover less willingly than those of any other nation ?
To assert that they have more or less courage than others is chimerical , nor can any man suppose them either more brave or timorous than those of the neighbouring countries , without discovering the meanest prejudices , and the narrowest conceptions  without showing that he is wholly unacquainted with human nature , and that he is influenced by the tales of nurses , and the boasts of children .


There was , therefore , no objection against the troops of Hanover , that was not of equal strength against all foreign troops  and there was at least one argument in their favour , that they were subjects of the same prince  and that , therefore , we could have no reason to fear their defection , or to suspect their fidelity .


The electorate of Hanover , with whatever contempt or indignation some persons may affect to mention it , is to be considered , at least , as a state in alliance with Britain , and to receive from us that support which the terms of that alliance may demand .


Any other regard , my lords , indeed , it is not necessary to contend for  since it can not be proved , that in this transaction we have acted otherwise than as with allies , or hired the troops on conditions which those of any other nation would not have obtained , or on any which they will not deserve  since your lordships have received assurances , that they are ready to enter the field , and to march into Germany against the common enemy .
That we might have raised new troops in our own nation , and have augmented our army with an equal number of men , can not be denied  nor do I doubt , my lords , but our countrymen would be equally formidable with any other forces  but it must be remembered , that an army is not to be levied in an instant , and that our natives , however warlike , are not born with the knowledge of the use of arms  and who knows , whether Europe might not have been enslaved before a British army could have been raised and disciplined for its deliverance ?


Whether this account of our measures will satisfy those who have hitherto condemned them , I am not able to foretel .
There are , indeed , some reasons for suspecting , that they blame not , because they disapprove , but because they think it necessary either to the character of discernment , or of probity , to censure the ministry , whatever maxims are pursued .
Of this disposition it is no slight proof , that contrary measures have been sometimes condemned by the same men with the same vehemence  and that even compliance with their demands has not stilled their outcries .
When the ministry appeared unwilling to engage in the war of Germany , without the concurrence of the other powers who had engaged to support the Pragmatick sanction , they were hourly reproached with being the slaves of France , with betraying the general cause of Europe , and with repressing that generous ardour , by which our ancestors have been incited to stand forth as the asserters of universal liberty , and to fight the quarrel of mankind .
They were marked out as either cowards or traitors , and doomed to infamy as the accomplices of tyranny , engaged in a conspiracy against their allies , their country , and their posterity .


At length the Britons have roused again , and again declared themselves the supporters of right , whenever injured  they have again raised their standards in the continent , and prepared to march again through those regions where their victories are yet celebrated , and their bravery yet reverenced .
The hills of Germany will again sound with the shouts of that people who once marched to her deliverance through all the obstructions that art or power could form against them , and which broke through the pass of Schellembourg , to rout the armies that were ranged behind it .


Now it might be expected , my lords , that , at least , those who were before dissatisfied , should declare their approbation  for surely where peace or neutrality is improper , there is nothing left but war .
Yet experience shows us , that men resolved to blame will never want pretences for venting their malignity  and where nothing but malignity is the consequence of opposite measures , we must necessarily conclude , that there is a fixed resolution to blame , and that all vindications will be ineffectual .


Some have , indeed , found out a middle course between censure and approbation , and declare , that they think these measures now justifiable , because we have proceeded too far to retreat with honour  and that though at first a better scheme might have been formed , yet this , which has hitherto been pursued , ought not now to be changed .


I , my lords , though it is not of very great importance to confute an opinion by which the measures of the government will not be obstructed , can not forbear to declare myself of different sentiments , and to assert , in opposition to artful calumnies and violent invectives , that the present measures were originally right , that they were such as prudence would dictate , and experience approve , and such as we ought again to take , if we have again the power of choice .


I am , indeed , far from doubting , but these measures will , in a short time , be justified by success  a criterion by which , however unjustly , the greatest part of mankind will always judge of the conduct of their governours  for it is apparent , my lords , that howsoever the French power , commerce , and wealth , have been exaggerated by those that either love or fear them , they will not long be able to stand against us  their funds will in a short time fail them , and their armies must be disbanded , when they can no longer be paid , lest , instead of protecting their country , they should be inclined to plunder it .


The abundance of our wealth , my lords , and the profit of our commerce , are sufficiently apparent from the price of our stocks , which were never before supported at the same height for so long a time  and of the fall of which neither an actual war with Spain , nor the danger which has been suggested of another with France , with France in the full possession of all its boasted advantages , has yet been able to produce any token .
Another proof of the exuberance of our riches , and the prosperity of our commerce , by which they are acquired , is the facility with which the government can raise in an instant the greatest sums , and the low interest at which they are obtained .
If we compare our state in this respect with that of France , the insuperable difficulties under which they must contend with us , will sufficiently discover themselves .
It is well known , my lords , that we have lately raised the money which the service of each year required , at the interest of three for a hundred  nor is it likely that there will be any necessity of larger interest , though our annual demands were to be equal to those of the last war .
But the French are well known to raise the sums which their exigencies require on very different terms , and to have paid ten for a hundred for all the money which their late projects have required  projects which they can not pursue long at such enormous expense , and by which their country must in a short time be ruined , even without opposition .


While we can , therefore , raise three millions for less than the French can obtain one , and , by consequence , support three regiments at the same expense as one is supported in their service , we have surely no reason to dread the superiority of their numbers , or to fear that they will conquer by exhausting us .


Thus , my lords , I have delivered my opinion with freedom and impartiality  and shall patiently hearken to any objections that shall arise against it , supported by the consciousness , that a confutation will only show me that I have been mistaken  but will not deprive me of the satisfaction of reflecting , that I have not been wanting to my country  and that if I have approved or defended improper measures , I at least consulted no other interest than that of Britain .


Lord HERVEY spoke next , to the following effect : -- My lords , it is not without that concern which every man ought to feel at the apparent approach of publick calamities , that I have heard the measures which are now the subject of our inquiry so weakly defended , when their vindication is endeavoured with so much ardour , and laboured with so much address .


The objections which press upon the mind , at the first and slightest view of our proceedings , are such as require the closest attention , such as can not but alarm every man who has studied the interest of his country , and who sincerely endeavours to promote it  and therefore it might be hoped , that those who appear to have thought them insufficient , are able to produce , in opposition to them , the strongest arguments , and the clearest deductions .


When we attempt the consideration of our present condition , and inquire by what means our prosperity may be secured , the first reflection that occurs , is , that we are traders , that all our power is the consequence of our wealth , and our wealth the product of our trade .
It is well known , that trade can only be pursued under the security of peace  that a nation which has a larger commerce , must make war on disadvantageous terms against one that has less  as of two contiguous countries , the more fruitful has most to fear from an invasion by its neighbour .


It is visible , likewise , to any man who considers the situation of Britain , that there is no nation by which our trade can in time of war be so much obstructed as by France , of which the coasts are opposite to ours , and which can send out small vessels , and seize our merchants in the mouths of our harbours , or in the Channel of which we boast the sovereignty : and all those who have heard or read of the last war , in which we gained so much honour , and so little advantage , know that the privateers of France injured us more than its navies or its armies  and that a thousand victories on the continent , where we were only contending for the rights of others , were a very small recompense for the obstruction of our commerce  nor can he feel much tenderness for mankind , who would purchase by the ruin and distress of a thousand families , industrious and innocent , the momentary festivity of a triumph , or the idle glare of an illumination .


Yet , my lords , this nation , however zealous for its commerce , is about to engage in a war , in a war with the only state by which our commerce can be impaired  it is about to support new armies on the continent without allies , and without treasure .


That we are without treasure , and that our trade , by which only our funds can be supplied , has lately been very much diminished , is too easy to prove in opposition to the specious display which the noble lord , who spoke last , has been pleased to make of the exuberance of our wealth .


If the abundance of our riches be such as it has been represented , why are no measures formed for the payment of the publick debts ?
of which no man will say , that they are not in themselves a calamity , and the source of many calamities yet greater  of which it can not be denied , that they multiply dependence by which our constitution may sometimes be endangered .
Why are those debts not only unpaid , but increased by annual additions to such a height , that the payment of them must soon become desperate , and the publick sink under the burden ?


That our trade , my lords , and by consequence our wealth , is of late diminished , may be proved beyond controversy , even to those whose interest it is not to believe it , and upon whom , therefore , it can not be expected , that arguments will have a great effect .
The produce of the customs was the last year less by half a million than the mean revenue  and as our customs must always bear a certain proportion to trade , we may form an indisputable estimate from them of its increase or its decline .


The rise of our stocks , my lords , is such a proof of riches , as dropsical tumours are of health  it shows not the circulation , but the stagnation of our money  and though it may flatter us with a false appearance of plenty for a time , will soon prove , that it is both the effect and cause of poverty , and will end in weakness and destruction .


When commerce flourishes , when its profit is certain and secure , men will employ their money in the exchange of commodities , by which greater advantage may be gained , than by putting it into the hands of brokers  but when every ship is in danger of being intercepted by privateers , and the insurer divides the profit of every voyage with the merchant , it is natural to choose a safer , though a less profitable traffick  and rather to treasure money in the funds , than expose it on the ocean .


But , my lords , the ministers themselves have sufficiently declared their opinion of the state of the national wealth , by the method which they have taken to raise those supplies of which they boast with how great facility they are raised .


When they found that new expenses required new taxes , it was necessary to examine what could be taxed , or upon which part of the nation any other burdens could be laid without immediate ruin .
They turned over the catalogue of all our manufactures , and found , that scarcely any of the conveniencies , or even the necessaries of life , were without an impost .
They examined all the classes of our traders , and readily discovered , that the greatest number of those who endeavoured to support themselves by honest industry , were struggling with poverty , and scarcely able to provide to-day what would be necessary to-morrow .
They saw our prisons crowded with debtors , and our papers filled with the names of bankrupts , of whom many may be supposed to have miscarried without idleness , extravagance , or folly .


They saw , therefore , my lords , that industry must sink under any addition to its load , a consideration which could afford no proof of the abundance of our wealth .
They saw that our commodities would be no longer manufactured , if their taxes were increased  and , therefore , it was necessary to raise money by some other method , since all those which have been hitherto practised were precluded .


This , my lords , was no easy task  but however difficult , it has been accomplished  and to those great politicians must posterity be indebted for a new scheme of supplying the expenses of a war .


In the time of the late ministry it had been observed , that drunkenness was become a vice almost universal among the common people  and that as the liquor which they generally drank was such that they could destroy their reason by a small quantity , and at a small expense , the consequence of general drunkenness was general idleness  since no man would work any longer than was necessary to lay him asleep for the remaining part of the day .
They remarked , likewise , that the liquor which they generally drank was to the last degree pernicious to health , and destructive of that corporeal vigour by which the business of life is to be carried on  and a law was therefore made , by which it was intended that this species of debauchery , so peculiarly fatal , should be prevented .


Against the end of this law no man has hitherto made the least objection  no one has dared to signalize himself as an open advocate for vice , or attempted to prove that drunkenness was not injurious to society , and contrary to the true ends of human being .
The encouragement of wickedness of this shameful kind , wickedness equally contemptible and hateful , was reserved for the present ministry , who are now about to supply those funds which they have exhausted by idle projects and romantick expeditions , at the expense of health and virtue  who have discovered a method of recruiting armies by the destruction of their fellow-subjects  and while they boast themselves the assertors of liberty , are endeavouring to enslave us by the introduction of those vices , which in all countries , and in every age , have made way for despotick power .


Even this expedient , my lords , must in a short time fail them  the products of vice as well as of commerce must in time be exhausted  and what will then remain ?
The honest and industrious must feel the weight of some new imposition , which the sagacity of experienced oppression may find means to lay upon them  they will then first find the benefit of this new law , since they may , by the use of those liquors which are indulged them , put a speedy end to that life which they made unable to support .


The means by which the expenses of our present designs are to be supported , such means , my lords , as were never yet practised by any state , however exhausted , or however endangered , means which a wise nation would scarcely use to repel an invader from the capital , or to raise works to keep off a general inundation , raise yet stronger motions of indignation , when it is considered for what designs these expenses are required .


We are now , my lords , raising armies , and hiring auxiliaries , for an expedition of which no necessity can be discovered , and from which neither honour nor advantage can be expected  we are about to force from the people the last remains of their property , and to harass with exactions those who are already languishing with poverty  not for the preservation of our liberty , or the defence of our country , but for the support of the Pragmatick sanction , for the execution of a very unjust scheme formed by the late king , to which he purchased at different times , on different emergencies , the concurrence of other powers  but to which he failed to put the last seal of confirmation , perhaps in hopes of a male heir , and left the design , which he had so long and so industriously laboured , to be at last completed by the kindness of his allies  having , by an unsuccessful war against the Turks , exhausted his treasure , and weakened his troops .


Whether we shall now engage in this design  whether we shall , for the defence of the Pragmatick sanction , begin another war on the continent , of which the duration can not be determined , the expense estimated , or the event foreseen  whether we shall contend at once with all the princes of the house of Bourbon , and entangle ourselves in a labyrinth of different schemes  whether we shall provoke France to interrupt our commerce , and invade our colonies , and stand without the assistance of a single ally , against those powers that lately set almost all Europe at defiance , is now to be determined by your lordships .


It can scarcely be expected , that the French will treat us only as auxiliaries , and satisfy themselves with attacking us only where they find themselves opposed by us : they will undoubtedly , my lords , consider us as principals , since they can suffer little more by declaring war against us .


These , my lords , are the dangers to be feared from the measures which we are now persuaded to pursue  but persuaded by arguments which , in my opinion , ought to have very little influence upon us , and which have not yet been able , however artfully or zealously enforced , to prevail upon the Dutch to unite with us .


It has , indeed , been asserted , that the Dutch appear inclined to assist us : but of that inclination stronger proofs ought surely to be produced , before we take auxiliaries into pay , and transport troops into another country , which has been so often represented to have been raised for the defence of their own , or collect money from the publick by the propagation of wickedness .


Of this favourable inclination in the Dutch I am the more doubtful , because it is contrary to the expectations of all mankind , and to the maxims by which they have generally regulated their conduct .
There have been many late instances of their patient submission to the invasion of privileges to which they have thought themselves entitled , and of their preference of peace , though sometimes purchased with the loss of honour  or , what may be supposed to touch a Dutchman much more nearly , of profit , to the devastation and expense and hazards of war  and it can hardly be supposed by any who know their character , that they will be more zealous for the rights of others than for their own  or that they will , for the support of the queen of Hungary , sacrifice that security and tranquillity which they have preferred at the expense of their commerce at one time , and by passive submission to insults at another .


That a nation like this , my lords , will in the quarrel of another engage in any but moderate measures , is not to be expected : it is not improbable , that they may endeavour by embassies and negotiations to adjust the present disputes , or offer their mediation to the contending powers  but I am very far from imagining , that they will find in themselves any disposition to raise armies , or equip fleets , that they will endanger the barrier which has been so dearly purchased , or expose themselves to the hazards and terrours of a French war  and am , therefore , inclined to believe , that if any tendency towards such measures now appears , it is only the effect of the present heat of some vehement declaimers , or the secret machination of some artful projectors among them , who have formed chimerical plans of a new system of Europe , and have , in their imaginations , regulated the distribution of dominion and power , or who , perhaps , have diminished their patrimonies by negligence and extravagance , and hope to repair them in times of confusion , and to glean part of that harvest of treasure which the publick must be obliged to yield in time of war .
I am still inclined to believe , that the true interest of the republick will be consulted , that policy will prevail over intrigue , and that only moderate measures will be pursued by the general council of the states .


Moderate measures , my lords , if not always the most honourable in the opinion of minds vitiated by false notions of grandeur , are , at least , always the most safe  and are , therefore , eligible at least , till the scene of affairs begins to open , and the success of a more vigorous conduct may with some degree of certainty be foreknown  and it must at least be thought imprudent for those to hazard much who can gain nothing , and therefore it will not be easy to assign any reason that may justify our conduct on the present occasion .


It is not improbable , my lords , that those who have now obtained the direction of our affairs , may be influenced by the general disapprobation which the British people showed of the pacifick conduct of the late ministry , and may have resolved to endeavour after applause , by showing more spirit and activity .
But , my lords , of two opposite schemes it is not impossible that both may be wrong , and that the middle way only may be safe  nor is it uncommon for those who are precipitately flying from one extreme , to rush blindly upon another .


But our ministry , my lords , have found out a method of complicating errours which none of their predecessors , however stigmatized for ignorance and absurdity , have hitherto been able to attain  they have been able to reconcile the extremes of folly , and to endanger the publick interest at the same time , by inactivity and romantick temerity .


No accusation against the late ministry was more general , more atrocious , or more adapted to incense the people , than that of neglecting the war against Spain : this was the subject of all the invectives which were vented against them in the senate , or dispersed among the people  for this they were charged with a secret confederacy against their country , with disregard of its commerce and its arms , and with a design to ruin the nation for no other end than to punish the merchants .


To this accusation , my lords , diligently propagated , willingly received , and , to confess the truth , confirmed by some appearances , do those owe their power , who now preside over the affairs of the nation  and it might , therefore , have been hoped , that by their promotion , one of our grievances would have been taken away , and that at least the war against Spain would have been vigorously prosecuted .


But this ministry , my lords , have only furnished a new instance of the credulity of mankind , of the delusion of outward appearances , and of the folly of hoping with too great ardour for any event , and of trusting any man with too great confidence .
No sooner were they possessed of the power to which their ambition had so long aspired , and of the salaries which had with so much eagerness been coveted by their avarice , than they forgot the complaints of the merchants , the value of commerce , the honour of the British flag , the danger of our American territories , and the great importance of the war with Spain , and contented themselves with ordering convoys for our merchants , instead of destroying the enemy by whom they are molested .


The fleets which are floating from one coast to another in the Mediterranean , and which sometimes strike terrour into the harmless inhabitants of an open coast , or threaten , but only threaten , destruction to an unfortified town , I am very far from considering as armaments fitted out against the Spaniards , who neither feel nor fear any great injury from them : their trade may be , indeed , somewhat impeded  but that inconvenience is amply compensated by their depredations upon our merchants : their navies may be confined to their own ports , or to those of France  but these navies are not very necessary to them , since they are not sufficiently powerful to oppose us on the ocean  and therefore they who are thus confined , suffer less than those who confine them .
We have , indeed , the empty pleasure of seeing ourselves lords of the sea , and of shaking the coasts with volleys of our cannon  but we purchase the triumph at a very high price , and shall find ourselves in time weakened by a useless ostentation of superiority .


The only parts of the Spanish dominions in which they can receive any hurt from our forces , are those countries which they possess in America , and from which they receive the gold and silver which inflame their pride , and incite them to insult nations more powerful than themselves .
By seizing any part of those wealthy regions , we shall stop the fountain of their treasure , reduce them to immediate penury , and compel them to solicit peace upon any conditions that we shall condescend to offer them .


The necessity of invading these countries , my lords , was perfectly understood , and very distinctly explained , when the forces destined for that expedition were delayed , and when the attempt at Carthagena miscarried  nothing was more pathetical than the complaints of the patriots , who spared no labour to inform either the senate or the nation of the advantages which success would have procured .
But what measures have been taken to repair our losses , or to regain our honour  or what new schemes have been formed for making an attack more forcible upon some weaker part ?


Every one can remember , that the miscarriage of that enterprise was imputed , not to its difficulty , nor to the courage of the Spaniards , nor to the strength of their works , but to the unskilfulness of our officers , and the impropriety of the season  and it was , therefore , without doubt thought not impossible to attack the Spanish colonies with success  but why then , my lords , have they hitherto suffered the Spaniards to discipline their troops , and strengthen their works at .
leisure , that at length they may securely set us at defiance , and plunder our merchants without fear of vengeance ?


Thus , my lords , has our real interest been neglected in pursuit not of any other scheme of equal advantage , but of the empty title of the arbiters of Europe  we have suffered our trade to be destroyed , and our country impoverished for the sake of holding the balance of power  that variable balance , in which folly and ambition are perpetually changing the weights , and which neither policy nor strength could yet preserve steady for a single year .


In the prosecution of this idle scheme , we are about to violate all the maxims of wisdom , and perhaps of justice  we are about to destroy the end by the means which we make use of to promote it , to endanger our country more by attempting to hinder the changes which are projected in Europe , than their accomplishment will endanger it , and to deliver up ourselves to France before she makes any demand of submission from us .


If any excuse could be made for expeditions so likely to end in ruin , it must be that justice required them  and that if we suffer , we at least suffer in support of right , and in an honest endeavour to promote the execution of the great laws of moral equity  that if we fail of success , we shall always have the consolation of having meant well , and of having deserved those victories which we could not gain .


But , upon an impartial survey of the cause in which we are going to engage , and on which we are about to hazard our own happiness , and that of our posterity , I can discover no such apparent justice on the side of the queen of Hungary , as ought to incite distant nations to espouse her quarrel , to raise armies in her favour , to consider her cause as that of human nature , and to prosecute those that invade her territories , as the enemies of general society .


The Pragmatick sanction , my lords , by which she claims all the hereditary dominions of her family , can not change the nature of right and wrong , nor invalidate any claim before subsisting , unless by the consent of the prince by whom it was made .
The elector of Bavaria may , therefore , urge in his own defence , that by the elder sister he has a clear and indisputable right , a right from which he never receded , as he never concurred in the Pragmatiok sanction  he may , therefore , charge this illustrious princess , for whom so many troops are raised , and for whom so much blood is about to be shed , with usurpation , with detention of the dominions of other potentates , and with an obstinate assertion of a false title .


That the Pragmatick sanction is generally understood to be unjust , appears sufficiently from the conduct of those powers who , though engaged by solemn stipulations to support it , yet look unconcerned on the violation of it , and appear convinced , that the princes who are now dividing among themselves the Austrian dominions , produce claims which can not be opposed without a manifest disregard of justice .


The pretensions of these princes ought , indeed , to have been more attentively considered , when this guaranty was first demanded  for it is evident , that either no such compact ought to have been made , or that it ought now to be observed  and that those who now justify the neglect of it , by urging its injustice , ought to have refused accession to it for the same reason .
But it is probable , that they will urge in their defence , what can not easily be confuted , that their consent was obtained by misrepresentations  and that he who has promised to do any thing on the supposition that it is right , is not bound by that promise , when he has discovered it to be wrong .


But though justice may , my lords , be pretended , I am far from doubting that policy has , in reality , supplied the motives upon which these powers proceed .
Since the world is evidently governed more by interest than virtue , I think it not unreasonable to imagine , that they form their measures according to their own expectations of advantage  and as I do not believe our countrymen distinguished from the rest of mankind by any peculiar disregard of themselves , it may not be improper to examine , even in this place , whether by restoring the house of Austria to its ancient greatness , we shall promote our own happiness , or that of the empire , or of the rest of Europe .


To ourselves , my lords , I do not see what assistance can be given in time of danger by this house , however powerful , or however friendly  for , I suppose , we shall never suffer it to grow powerful by sea as well as by land , and by sea only can we receive benefits or injuries .
What advantages the rest of Europe may promise themselves from the restoration of the Austrian power , may be learned , my lords , from the history of the great emperour , Charles the fifth , who for many years kept the world in continual alarms , ranged from nation to nation with incessant and insatiable ambition , made war only for the extinction of the protestant religion , and employed his power and his abilities in harassing the neighbouring princes , and disturbing the tranquillity of mankind .


Nor did his successours , my lords , though weakened by the division of his dominions , enjoy their power with greater moderation , or exert it to better purposes .
It is well known , that they endeavoured the subversion of both the liberties and religion of the subordinate states of the empire , and that the great king of Sweden was called into Germany , as well for the preservation of the protestant religion , as of the rights of the electors .


This , my lords , is so generally known and confessed , that Puffendorf , the best writer on the German constitution , has declared it disadvantageous to the empire to place at its head a prince too powerful by his hereditary dominions , since they will always furnish him with force to oppress the weaker princes  and it is not often found , that he who has the power to oppress , is restrained by principles of justice .


It appears , therefore , to me , my lords , that the late election of an emperour was made with sufficient regard to the general good  and that , therefore , neither policy nor equity oblige us to act in a manner different from the other powers who are joined in the same engagements , of whom I do not learn , by any of the common channels of intelligence , that any of them intend the support of the Pragmatick sanction  for no newspaper or pamphlet has yet informed us , that any of the other powers are hiring auxiliaries , or regulating the march of their troops , or making any uncommon preparations , which may foretoken an expedition against the emperour or his allies .


Yet , my lords , they are not restrained from attacking the emperour , by so strong objections as may be made to the present design  for they owe him no obedience as their sovereign , nor have contributed to the acquisition of his honours  they have not , like his majesty , given their votes for his exaltation to the imperial seat , nor have acknowledged his right by granting him an aid .
They might , therefore , without charge of disloyalty or inconsistency , endeavour to dethrone him  but how his majesty can engage in any such design , after having zealously promoted his advancement , and confirmed his election by the usual acknowledgment , I am not able to understand .
It is evident , that the king of Prussia believes himself restrained by his own acts , and thinks it absurd to fight against an emperour , who obtained the throne by his choice  he , therefore , has , with his usual wisdom , refused to engage in the confederacy , nor have either promises or concessions been able to obtain more from him than a bare neutrality .


Whether , indeed , any more than a neutrality be intended , even by this pompous armament , for which we are now required to provide , I maybe allowed to doubt  since the troops that are hired at so high a rate , are such as can not act against the enemies of the queen of Hungary , without breach of the imperial constitutions .


It has been already justly observed in this debate , that when the emperour has obtained from the diet an aid of fifty months , that act is considered as an authentick recognition of his title  nor can any of the German princes afterwards make war against him , without subjecting his dominions to the imperial interdict , and losing the privileges of his sovereignty .


That the present emperour has already received this acknowledgment , and been confessed by his majesty , as elector of Hanover , to be legally invested with the imperial dignity , is well known  and , therefore , I can not by any method of reasoning discover , nor have yet found any man able to inform me , why the troops of Hanover are chosen before those of any other nation , for a design which they can not execute , without ruining their sovereign if they fail  and infringing the constitution of the empire , if they should happen to succeed ?


I should , therefore , have imagined , that the assistance of the queen of Hungary was only pretended , and that the forces were only designed to breathe the air of the continent , and to display their scarlet at the expense of Britain , had not the noble lord who spoke third in this debate informed us , that they will in reality march into Germany  a design , my lords , so romantick , unseasonable , and dangerous , that though I can not doubt it after such assurances , I should not have believed it on any other  a design which I hope every man , who regards the welfare of this kingdom , will indefatigably oppose , and which every Briton must wish that some lucky accident may frustrate .


To send an army into Germany , my lords , is to hazard our native country without necessity , without temptation , without prospect or possibility of advantage  it is to engage in a quarrel which has no relation to our dominions , or rights , or commerce  a quarrel from which , however it be decided , we can neither hope for any increase of our wealth , our force , or our influence  but which may involve us in a war without end , in which it will be difficult to obtain the victory , and in which we must yet either conquer or be undone .


Surely , my lords , an expedition like this was never undertaken before , without consulting the senate , and declaring the motives on which it was designed  surely never was any supply of this nature demanded , without some previous discoveries to this house of the importance of the service for which they were required to provide .
On this occasion , my lords , all the councils of the government are covered by a cloud of affected secrecy , nor is any knowledge of our affairs to be gained , but from papers which are not to be regarded here , the printed votes of the other house .


I am always , my lords , inclined to suspect unusual secrecy , and to imagine , that men either conceal their measures , because they can not defend them , or affect an appearance of concealing them , when in reality they have yet projected nothing , and draw the veil with uncommon care , only lest it should be discovered that there is nothing behind it  as when palaces are shown , those apartments which are empty , are carefully locked up .


To confess my opinion without reserve , I am not so much inclined to believe , that our ministers ' designs are bad , as that they design nothing  and suspect that this mighty army , so lavishly paid , and collected from such distant parts , is to regulate its motions by accident , and to wait without action , till some change in the state of Europe shall make it more easy for our ministers to form their scheme .


I hope , my lords , that by some accident more favourable than we have at present reason to expect , our German expedition will be retarded , till our ministers shall awaken from their present dream of delivering Europe from the French ambition , and of restoring the ancient greatness of the house of Austria .
I hope every day , as it adds to their experience , will diminish that ardour which is generally the effect of imperfect views , which is commonly raised by partial considerations , and ends in inconsiderate undertakings .
I hope they will in time think it no advantage to their fellow-subjects to be doomed to fight the battles of other nations , and to be called out into every field , where they shall happen to hear that blood is to be shed .
I hope they will be taught , that the only business of Britain is commerce  and that while our ships pass unmolested , we may sit at ease , whatever be the designs or actions of the potentates on the continent  that none but naval power can endanger our safety , and that it is not necessary for us to inquire , how foreign territories are distributed , what family approaches to its extinction , or where a successour will be found to any other crown than that of Britain .


If these maxims were once generally understood , from how much perplexity would our councils be set free ?
how many thousands of our fellow-subjects would be preserved from slaughter ?
and how much would our wealth be increased , by saving those sums which are yearly squandered in idle expeditions , or in negotiations equally useless , and , perhaps , equally expensive ?
Had these principles been received by our forefathers , we might now have given laws to the world , and , perhaps , our posterity will , with equal reason , say , How happy , how great and formidable they should have been , had not we attempted to fix and to hold the balance of power , and neglected the interest of our country for the preservation of the house of Austria !


Thus , my lords , I have endeavoured to explain and enforce my opinion of the measures in which our ministers have engaged the nation  and hope that I shall not be accused of being influenced in my determinations by personal prejudices , nor of having changed my opinions with regard to publick affairs , in consequence of any change of the persons by whom they are conducted .
For if my sentiments have ever been thought important enough to be retained in memory , I can , with the utmost confidence , appeal to all those who can recollect what I have formerly said , when the reestablishment of the house of Austria was the subject of our consultations  and defy the most rigorous and attentive examiner of my conduct , to prove , that there ever was a time in which I thought it necessary or expedient for the British nation to be entangled in disputes on the continent , or to employ her arms in regulating the pretensions of contending powers .


I was always of opinion , my lords , that peace is the most eligible state , and that the ease of security is to be preferred to the honour of victory .
I always thought peace particularly necessary to a trading people  and as I have yet found no reason to alter my sentiments , and as auxiliaries can not be of any use but in time of war , I shall endeavour to promote peace by joining in the motion .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke to this effect : -- My lords , notwithstanding the atrocious charges which have been urged with so much vehemence against the ministry  notwithstanding the folly and absurdity which some lords have imagined themselves to have discovered in the present measures , I can not yet prevail upon myself , whatever may be my veneration for their integrity , or my confidence in their abilities , to approve the motion for which they so earnestly contend .


To comply with this motion , my lords , would be , in my opinion , to betray the general cause of mankind , to interrupt the success of the assertors of liberty , to give up all the continent , at once , to the house of Bourbon , to defeat all the measures of our ancestors and ourselves , and to invite the oppressors of mankind to extend their claims of universal dominion to the island of Britain .


Of the measures which we are now to consider , I think the defence at once obvious and unanswerable  and should advise , that instead of exerting an useless sagacity in uncertain conjectures on future events , or displaying unseasonable knowledge by the citation of authorities , or the recollection of ancient facts , every lord should attentively compare the state into which Europe was reduced soon after the death of the late emperour , with that in which it now appears  and inquire to what causes such sudden and important changes are to be ascribed .
He will then easily discover the efficacy of the British measures  and be convinced , that nothing has been omitted which the interest of this nation required .


When I hear it asked by the noble lords , what effects have been produced by our armaments and expenses ?
For what end auxiliaries are hired , and why our armies are transported into Flanders ?
I can not but suspect , my lords , that this affectation of ignorance is only intended to irritate their opponents  that they suppress facts with which they are well acquainted , only that they may have an opportunity of giving vent to their passions , of displaying their imagination in artful reproaches , and exercising their eloquence in splendid declamations .
I believe they hide what they know where to find , only to oblige others to the labour of producing it  and ask questions , not because they want or desire information , but because they hope to weary those whose stations condemn them to the task of answering them .


The effects , my lords , which the assistance given by us to the queen of Hungary have already produced , are the recovery of one kingdom , and the safety of the rest  the exclusion of the Spaniards from Italy on the one part , and on the other the confinement of them in it , without either the supplies for war , or the necessaries of life .


These , my lords , are surely great advantages  but these are not the greatest which we have reason to hope .
Our vigour and resolution have at last animated the Dutch to suspend for a time their attention to trade and money , and to consider what they seldom much regard , the state of other nations  the most rich and powerful of their provinces have already determined to concur in the reestablishment of the house of Austria  and if the approbation of the rest be necessary , it is likely to be obtained by the same method of proceeding .


Thus , my lords , we have a prospect of doing that which the ministers of queen Anne , whose fidelity , wisdom , and address , have been so often and so invidiously commended , thought their greatest honour , and the strongest proof of their abilities .
We may soon form another confederacy against the house of Bourbon , at a time when Louis the fourteenth is not at its head , at a time when it is exhausted by expensive projects  and when , therefore , it can not make the same resistance as when it was before attacked .


By pursuing the scheme which is now formed , with steadiness and ardour , we may , perhaps , reinstate all those nations in their liberties , whom cowardice , or negligence , or credulity have , during the last century , delivered up to the ambition of France  we may confine that swelling monarchy , which has from year to year torn down the boundaries of its neighbours , within its ancient limits , and disable it for ages from giving any new alarms to mankind , and from making any other efforts for the acquisition of universal dominion  we may reestablish the house of Austria as the great barrier of the world , by which it is preserved on one part from being laid waste by the barbarity of the Turks , and on the other from being enslaved by politer tyrants , and overrun by the ambition of France .


Elevated with such success , and encouraged by such prospects , we ought surely , my lords , to press forward in a path , where we have hitherto found no difficulties , and which leads directly to solid peace and happiness , which no dangers or terrours can hereafter interrupt : we ought , instead of relaxing , to redouble our efforts  and to remember , that by exerting all our strength and all our influence for a short time , we shall not only secure ourselves and our posterity from insolence and oppression , but shall establish the tranquillity of the world , and promote the general felicity of the human species .


For these great purposes , my lords , are those auxiliaries retained , of which some lords now require the dismission  and those armies transported , which part of the nation is by false reports inclined to recall  but I hope that such unreasonable demands will not be gratified , and that the faith of treaties , the ties of friendship , the call of justice , and the expectations of our allies , will easily prevail upon your lordships to despise the murmurs of prejudice , and the outcries of faction .


Lord BATH replied to the following effect : -- My lords , as I am far from thinking , that my advice or opinion can be of any use in this illustrious assembly , I should have listened in silence to this debate , important as it is , had I not thought it my duty to defend here what I approved in the council  and considered it as an act of cowardice and meanness to fall passively down the stream of popularity , and to suffer my reason and my integrity to be overborne by the noise of vulgar clamours , which have been raised against the measures of the government by the low arts of exaggeration , fallacious reasonings , and partial representations .
It is not without concern , my lords , that even in this house I observe some inclination to gratify the prejudices of the people , and to confirm them in their contempt of the foreign troops , by the poor artifice of contemptuous language .
To dispute about words , is , indeed , seldom useful  and when questions so weighty as these are before us , may be justly censured as improper .
I shall , therefore , only observe that the term mercenaries , which is in the motion applied to the forces of Hanover , seems designed rather to affect the passions than influence the reason , and intended only to express a partiality which can not be justified .


But it is far more necessary , my lords , to consider upon what motives the troops of Hanover were hired , than by what denomination they may most properly be called  and therefore I shall endeavour to explain the reasons which induced the ministry to retain them , and which , I suppose , have prevailed upon the commons to provide for their support .


It has been asked , why the troops of Hanover were preferred to those of any other nation ?
And it has been insinuated , that our determination was influenced by motives very different from that regard which every Briton owes to the interest of his native country .
But to this imputation , however specious , and however popular , it may be with great security replied , that there was no preference , because there was no choice  that there was a necessity for hiring troops , and that no other troops were to be obtained  and whoever shall endeavour to invalidate this defence , must engage in an undertaking of which I can boldly affirm , that he will find it very difficult .
He must show what power would have been able or willing to have furnished us with troops on this occasion  and I am confident , that whoever shall , with this design , take a deliberate survey of the several kingdoms and states of Europe , will find , that there is no other prince to whom we could have applied on this occasion , without greater inconveniencies than can reasonably be feared from the present stipulation with Hanover .


The reasons , indeed , for which this stipulation was made , appeared so strong , when it was considered in the council , that it was unanimously determined necessary  nor was the conclusion hastily made in an assembly of particular persons , who might be suspected of favouring it from private views , and of being convened on purpose to put it in execution : it was debated by a great number with great solemnity  nor can any man say , that he only yielded to what he found it in vain to oppose  for the consent given was not a tacit acquiescence , but a verbal approbation .
So far was this part of our measures from being the advice of any single man , or transacted with that solicitous secrecy which is the usual refuge of bad designs .


It has been asserted , likewise , my lords , and with much greater appearance of justice , that this whole design has been formed and conducted without the concurrence or approbation of the senate  and that , therefore , it can be considered only as a private scheme to be executed at the publick expense , as a plan formed by the ministry to aggrandize or ingratiate themselves at the hazard of the nation .


But even this , my lords , is a misrepresentation , though a misrepresentation more artful , and more difficult to defeat  because , in order to the justification of our measures , it is necessary to take a review of past transactions , and to consider what was necessarily implied by former determinations of the senate .


The period , my lords , to which this consideration will necessarily carry us back , is the time at which , after the late tedious war , a peace was , on whatever terms , concluded with France .
It is well known , that the confederates demanded , among other advantages , a cession of that part of Flanders , which had been for many years in the possession of Spain , and which opened a way by which the ambition of the house of Bourbon might make inroads at pleasure into the dominions of either the Austrians or Dutch .
This they were immediately interested in preventing  and as we knew the necessity of preserving the equipoise of power , we likewise were remotely engaged to promote any measures by which it might be secured .
In this demand , therefore , all the confederate powers naturally united , and by their united influence enforced compliance .
But though it was easy , with no great profundity of political knowledge , to discover from whom these provinces should be taken away , to whom they should be given , was a question of more difficulty  since they might add to the power that had opportunities of improving them , such an increase of commerce and wealth as might defeat the end for which they were demanded , and destroy the balance of power , by transferring too much weight into another scale .
And mankind has learned , my lords , by experience , that exorbitant power will always produce exorbitant pride  that very few , when they can oppress with security , will be contained within the bounds of equity by the restraints of morality or of religion  and that , therefore , the only method of establishing a lasting peace is to divide power so equally , that no party may have any certain prospect of advantage by making war upon another .


For this reason , my lords , it was apparently contrary to our interest to grant those provinces to those to whom , by their situation , they might have been most useful .
Such countries , and such manufactures in the hands of a people versed , perhaps , beyond all others , both in the science and the stratagems of trade , and always watchful to improve every opportunity of increasing their riches , would have enabled them in a short time to purchase an interest in the councils of all the monarchs of the world , to have maintained fleets that might have covered the ocean , and to have obtained that universal dominion to which the French have so long aspired , and which it is , perhaps , more for the interest of mankind , that if slavery can not be prevented , they should obtain , as they would , perhaps , use their power with more generosity .


The same reason , my lords , naturally made the Dutch unwilling to put these provinces in the hands of Britain  for we , likewise , make a profession of trade , though we do not pursue it with the same ardour , or , to confess the truth , with the same success : it was not , however , to be imagined , that there would not be found among us some men of sagacity to discern , and of industry to improve the opportunities which the new dominions would have put into our hands of vending our manufactures in parts where , at present , they are very little known .
Nor was this the only danger to be feared from such an increase of dominion : the Dutch have not yet forgotten , that though we at first rescued them from slavery , patronised the infancy of their state , and continued our guardianship till it was grown up to maturity , and enabled to support itself by its own strength , yet we afterwards made very vigorous attempts to reduce it to its original weakness , and to sink it into pupillage again  that we attempted to invade the most essential part of its rights , and to prescribe the number of ships that it should maintain .
They know , likewise , my lords , that by the natural rotation of human affairs , the same counsels may in some future reign be again pursued , or that some unavoidable conflict of interest may produce a contest that can be decided only by the sword  and then it may easily be perceived how much they would be endangered , by the neighbourhood of British garrisons , and of countries , where we might maintain numerous armies at a very small expense .
It is , therefore , no subject of wonder , that a nation much less subtile than the Dutch should find out how much it was their interest , that we should be confined within the limits of our own island  and that we should not have it in our power to attack them with armies as well as fleets , and at once to obstruct their commerce and invade their country .


There remained , therefore , my lords , no power but the emperour to whom these provinces could be consigned  and to him , therefore , they were given , but given only in trust for the joint advantage of the whole confederacy  he , indeed , enjoys their revenues on condition that he shall support the garrisons necessary to their defence  but he can not transfer them to any other power , or alienate them to the detriment of those nations who concurred in acquiring them .


It may not be improper , my lords , to observe , that on this contract depends the justice of our conduct with regard to the company established at Ostend for carrying on a trade to the East Indies .
These provinces were granted to the confederate powers , and consigned to the emperour to be enjoyed by him for the common benefit : it was , therefore , plainly intended by this contract , that he should use none of the advantages which these new dominions afforded him , to the detriment of those powers by whose gift he enjoyed them  nor could it be supposed that the Dutch and Britons debarred each other from those opportunities of trade only to enable the emperour to rival them both .


The towns , therefore , my lords , were at this time determined by the senate to be the general property of all the confederate powers , acquired by their united arms , and to be preserved for their common advantage , as the pledge of peace , and the palladium of Europe .
If , therefore , it should at any time happen , that they should be endangered either by the weakness or neglect of any one of those powers , the rest are to exert their right , and endeavour their preservation and security  nor is there any new stipulation or law necessary for this  since , with respect to the confederates , it is implied in the original stipulation , and with regard to the senate of Britain , in the approbation which was bestowed upon that contract , when it was made .


The time , my lords , in which this common right is to be exerted , is now arrived  the queen of Hungary , invaded in her hereditary dominions , and pressed on every side by a general combination of almost all the surrounding princes , declares herself no longer able to support the garrisons of the barrier , and informs us , that she intends to recall her troops for the defence of their own country .
What , then , is more apparent , my lords , than that either these towns must fall again into the hands of the French , and that we shall be obliged to recover them , if they can ever be recovered , at the expense of another ten years ' war , or that either we or the Dutch must send troops to supply the place of those which the necessities of their sovereign oblige her to withdraw .


That the towns of Flanders should be resigned gratuitously to France , that the enemies of mankind should be put in possession of the strongest bulwarks in the world , surrounded by fields and pastures able to maintain their garrisons without expense , will not be proposed by any of this assembly .
But it may easily and naturally be objected , that the Dutch ought to garrison these towns , as more nearly interested in their preservation , and more commodiously situated for their defence  nor can it be , indeed , denied , that the Dutch may be justly censured for their neglect , as they appear to leave the common cause to our protection , and to prefer their commerce and their ease to their own safety and the happiness of the world .


This , my lords , has been very warmly asserted in their own assemblies , nor have there been wanting men of spirit and integrity amongst them who have despised the gold and promises , and detected the artifices of France  who have endeavoured by all the arts of argument and persuasion to rouse their countrymen to remembrance of their former danger , and to an inquiry into their real interest  who have advised the levy of new forces , and the establishment of a new confederacy  who have called upon the state to face danger while it is yet distant , and to secure their own country by pouring their garrisons into the towns and citadels by which their frontiers are protected .
If their arguments , however just , have not yet attained their end , it is to be imputed to the constitution , embarrassed by the combination of different interests , which must be reconciled , before any resolution can be formed .
A single town , my lords , can , by refusing its consent , put a stand to the most necessary designs , and it is easily to be imagined , that by a monarch equally crafty and rich , a single town may sometimes be bribed into measures contrary to the publick interest .


But , my lords , the negligence of the Dutch is a motive which ought to incite us to vigour and despatch  since it is not for the sake of the Dutch but ourselves , that we desire the suppression of France .
If the Dutch are at length convinced of the ease of slavery , and think liberty no longer worth the labour of preserving it , -- if they are tired with the task of labouring for the happiness of others , and have forsaken the stand on which they were placed , as the general watch of the world , to indulge themselves in tranquillity and slumber , -- let not us , my lords , give way to the same infatuation  let not us look with neglect on the deluge that rolls towards us till it has advanced too far to be resisted .
Let us remember , that we are to owe our preservation only to ourselves , and redouble our efforts in proportion as others neglect their duty .
Let us show mankind , that we are neither afraid to stand up alone in defence of justice and of freedom , nor unable to maintain the cause that we have undertaken to assert .


But if it should be thought by any of this noble assembly , that the concurrence of the Dutch is absolutely necessary to a prospect of success , it may be reasonably answered , that by engaging in measures which can leave no doubt of either our power or our sincerity , the concurrence of the Dutch is most likely to be obtained .
By this method of proceeding , my lords , was formed the last mighty confederacy by which the house of Bourbon was almost shaken into ruins .
The Dutch then , as now , were slow in their determinations , and perhaps equally diffident of their own strength and our firmness  nor did they agree to declare war against France , till we had transported ten thousand men into Flanders , and convinced them that we were not inviting them to a mock alliance  but that we really intended the reduction of that empire which had so long extended itself without interruption , and threatened in a short time to swallow up all the western nations .


Thus , my lords , it appears , that the measures which have been pursued are just , politick , and legal  that they have been prescribed by the decrees of former senates , and therefore can not be censured as arbitrary  and that they have a tendency to the preservation of those territories which it was once thought so much honour to acquire : and it may be yet farther urged , that though they are to be considered only as the first tendencies to secure greater designs , they have already produced effects apparently to the advantage of the common cause , and have obliged the French to desist from their pursuit of the queen of Hungary , and rather to inquire how they shall return home than how they shall proceed to farther conquests .


In condemnation of these measures , my lords , it has indeed been urged , that a moderate conduct is always eligible  and that nothing but ruin and confusion can be expected from precipitation and temerity .
Moderation , my lords , is a very captivating sound  but I hope it will have now no influence on this assembly  because on this occasion it can not properly be employed .
I have always been taught , that moderation is only useful in forming determinations or designs , but that when once conviction is attained , zeal is to take place  and when a design is planned , it ought to be executed with vigour .


The question is not now , my lords , whether we shall support the queen of Hungary , but in what manner she shall be supported  and , therefore , it can not be doubted , but that such support should be granted her as may be effectual  and I believe it will not be thought , that we can assist her without exerting an uncommon degree of vigour , and showing , that we consider ourselves as engaged in a cause which can not be abandoned without disgrace and ruin .


If the noble lord had , before he entered upon his encomium on moderation , considered what effects could be promised from his favourite virtue , he would have had no inclination to display his eloquence upon it .
By moderation , my lords , uninterrupted moderation of more than twenty years , have we become the scorn of mankind , and exposed ourselves to the insults of almost every nation in the world .
By moderation have we betrayed our allies , and suffered our friendship to lose all its value  by moderation have we given up commerce to the rapacity of an enemy , formidable only for his perseverance , and suffered our merchants to be ruined , and our sailors to be enslaved .
By moderation have we permitted the French to grasp again at general dominion , to overrun Germany with their armies , and to endanger again the liberties of mankind  and by continuing , for a very few years , the same laudable moderation , we shall probably encourage them to shut up our ships in our harbour , and demand a tribute for the use of the Channel .


I need not observe to your lordships , that all the great actions that have , in all ages , been achieved , have been the effects of resolution , diligence , and daring activity , virtues wholly opposite to the calmness of moderation .
I need not observe , that the advantages enjoyed at present by the French are the consequences of that vigour and expedition , by which they are distinguished , and which the form of their government enables them to exert .
Had they , my lords , instead of pouring armies into the Austrian dominions , and procuring , by the terrour of their troops , the election of an emperour , pursued these measures of moderation which have been so pathetically recommended , how easily had their designs been defeated ?


Had they lost time in persuading the queen of Hungary by a solemn embassy to resign her dominions , or attempted to influence the diet by amicable negotiations , armies had been levied , and the passes of Germany had been shut against them  they had been opposed on the frontiers of their own dominions , by troops equally numerous and warlike with their own , and instead of imposing a sovereign on the empire , had been , perhaps , pursued into their own country .


But , my lords , whether moderation was not recommended to them by such powerful oratory as your lordships have heard , or whether its advocates met with an audience not easily to be convinced , it is plain that they seem to have acted upon very different principles , and I wish their policy had not been so strongly justified by its success .
By sending an army into Germany , my lords , when there were no forces ready to oppose them , they reduced all the petty princes to immediate submission , and obliged those to welcome them as friends , who would gladly have united against them as the inveterate enemies of the whole German body  and who , had they been firmly joined by their neighbours , under a general sense of their common danger , would have easily raised an army able to have repelled them .


This , my lords , was the effect of vigour , an effect very different from that which we had an opportunity of experiencing as the consequence of moderation  it was to no purpose that we endeavoured to alarm mankind by remonstrances , and to procure assistance by entreaties and solicitations  the universal panick was not to be removed by advice and exhortations , and the queen of Hungary must have sunk under the weight of a general combination against her , had we not at last risen up in her defence , and with our swords in our hands , set an example to the nations of Europe , of courage and generosity .


It then quickly appeared , my lords , how little is to be expected from cold persuasion , and how necessary it is , that he who would engage others in a task of difficulty , should show himself willing to partake the labour which he recommends .
No sooner had we declared our resolution to fulfil our stipulations , and ordered our troops to march for the relief of the queen of Hungary , than other princes discovered that they had the same dispositions , though they had hitherto thought it prudent to conceal them  that they , equally with ourselves , hated and feared the French  that they were desirous to repress their insolence and oppose their conquests , and only waited for the motions of some power who might stand at the head of the confederacy , and lead them forwards against the common enemy .
The liberal promises of dominion made by the French , by which the sovereigns of Germany had been tempted to concur in a design which they thought themselves unable to oppose , were now no longer regarded  they were considered only as the boasts of imaginary greatness , which would at last vanish into air  and every one knew , that the ultimate design of Europe was to oppress equally her enemies and friends  they wisely despised her offers , and either desisted from the designs to which they had been incited by her , or declared themselves ready to unite against her .


This , my lords , has been the consequence of assembling the army , which , by the motion now under our consideration , some of your lordships seem desirous to disband , an inclination of which I can not discover from whence it can arise .


For what , my lords , must be the consequence , if this motion should be complied with ?
what but the total destruction of the whole system of power which has been so laboriously formed and so strongly compacted ?
what but the immediate ruin of the house of Austria , by which the French ambition has been so long restrained ?
what but the subversion of the liberties of Germany , and the erection of an universal empire , to which all the nations of the earth must become vassals ?


Should the auxiliary troops be disbanded , the queen of Hungary would find what benefit she has received from them by the calamities which the loss of them would immediately bring upon her .
All the claims of all the neighbouring princes , who are now awed into peace and silence , would be revived , and every one would again believe , that nothing was to be hoped or feared but from France .
The French would again rush forward to new invasions , and spread desolation over other countries , and the house of Austria would be more weakened than by the loss of many battles in its present state .


The support of the house of Austria appears not , indeed , much to engage the attention of those by whom this motion is supported .
It has been represented as a house equally ambitious and perfidious with that of Bourbon , and equally an enemy both to liberty and to true religion  and a very celebrated author has been quoted to prove , that it is the interest of the Germans themselves to see a prince at their head , whose hereditary dominions may not incite him to exert the imperial power to the disadvantage of the inferiour sovereigns .


In order to the consideration of these objections , it is necessary to observe , my lords , that national alliances are not like leagues of friendship , the consequences of an agreement of disposition , opinions , and affections , but like associations of commerce , formed and continued by no similitude of any thing but interest .
It is not , therefore , necessary to inquire what the house of Austria has deserved from us or from mankind  because interest , not gratitude , engages us to support it .
It is useless to urge , that it is equally faithless and cruel with the house of Bourbon , because the question is not whether both shall be destroyed , but whether one should rage without control .
It is sufficient for us that their interest is opposite , and that religion and liberty may be preserved by their mutual jealousy .
And I confess , my lords , that were the Austrians about to attain unlimited power by the conquest or inheritance of France and Spain , it would be no less proper to form confederacies against them .


The testimony which has been produced of the convenience of a weak emperour , is to be considered , my lords , as the opinion of an author whose birth and employment had tainted him with an inveterate hatred of the house of Austria , and filled his imagination with an habitual dread of the imperial power .
He was born , my lords , in Sweden , a country which had suffered much by a long war against the emperour  he was a minister to the electors of Brandenburgh , who naturally looked with envy on the superiority of Austria , and could not but wish to see a weaker prince upon the imperial throne , that their own influence might be greater  nor can we wonder , that a man thus born and thus supported should adopt an opinion by which the pride of his master would be flattered , and perhaps the interest of his own country promoted .


It is likewise , my lords , to be remarked , that there was then no such necessity for a powerful prince to stand at the head of the Germans , and to defend them with his own forces till they could unite for their own preservation .
The power of France had not then arrived at its present height , nor had their monarchs openly threatened to enslave all the nations of Europe .
The princes of the empire had then no oppression to fear , but from the emperour  and it was no wonder , that when he was their only enemy , they wished that his power was reduced .


How much the state of the continent is now changed , is not necessary to mention , nor what alteration that change has introduced into the politicks of all nations  those who formerly dreaded to be overwhelmed by the imperial greatness , can now only hope to be secured by it from the torrent of the power of France  and even those nations who have formerly endeavoured the destruction of Austria , may now rejoice , that they are sheltered by its interposition from tyrants more active and more oppressive .


But , my lords , though it should be granted that the house of Austria ought not to be supported , it will not , in my opinion , follow , that this motion deserves our approbation  because it will reduce us to a state of imbecility , and condemn us to stand as passive spectators of the disturbances of the world , without power and without influence , ready to admit the tyrant to whom chance shall allot us , and receive those laws which the prevailing power shall vouchsafe to transmit .


Whether we ought to support the house of Austria , to prevent its utter subversion , or restore it to its former greatness , whatever may be my private opinion , I think it not on this occasion necessary to assert  it is sufficient to induce us to reject this motion , that we ought to be at least in a condition that may enable us to improve those opportunities that may be offered , and to hinder the execution of any design that may threaten immediate danger to our commerce or our liberty .


Another popular topick , my lords , which has been echoed on the present occasion , is the happiness of peace , and the blessing of uninterrupted commerce and undisturbed security .
We are perpetually told of the hazards of war , whatever may be the superiority of our skill or courage  of the certainty of the expenses , the bloodshed , and the hardships , and doubtfulness of the advantages which we may hope from them  and it is daily urged with great vehemence , that peace upon the hardest conditions is preferable to the honour of conquests , and the festivity of triumphs .


These maxims , my lords , which are generally true in the sense which their authors intended , may be very properly urged against the wild designs of ambition , and the romantick undertakings of wanton greatness  but have no place in the present inquiry , which relates to a war not made by caprice , but forced upon us by necessity  a war to which all the encomiums on peace , must in reality incite , because peace alone is the end intended to be obtained by it .


Of the necessity of peace to a trading nation it is not possible , my lords , to be ignorant  and therefore no man can be imagined to propose a state of war as eligible in itself .
War , my lords , is , in my opinion , only to be chosen , when peace can be no longer enjoyed , and to be continued only till a peace secure and equitable can be attained .
In the present state of the world , my lords , we fight not for laurels , nor conquests , but for existence .
Should the arms of France prevail , and prevail they must , unless we oppose them , the Britons may , in a short time , no longer be a nation , our liberties will be taken away , our constitution destroyed , our religion persecuted , and perhaps our name abolished .


For the prevention of calamities like these , not for the preservation of the house of Austria , it is necessary , my lords , to collect an army  for by an army only can our liberties be preserved , and such a peace obtained , as may be enjoyed without the imputation of supineness and stupidity .


Of this the other house appears to be sufficiently convinced , and has therefore granted money for the support of the auxiliary troops  nor do I doubt but your lordships will concur with them , when you shall fully consider the motives upon which they may be supposed to have proceeded , and reflect , that by dismissing these troops , we shall sacrifice to the ambition of the French , the house of Austria , the liberties of Europe , our own happiness , and that of our posterity  and that , by resolving to exert our forces for a short time , we may place the happiness of mankind beyond the reach of attacks and violation .


Lord CARTERET replied to the following effect : -- My lords , the considerations which were laid before you by the noble lords who made and seconded the motion , are so important in themselves , and have been urged with so much force and judgment , that I shall not endeavour to add any new arguments  since , where those fail which have been already offered , it is not likely that any will be effectual : but I shall endeavour to preserve them in their full force by removing the objections which have been made to them .


The first consideration that claims our attention is the reverence due to the senate , to the great council of the nation , which ought always to be consulted when any important design is formed , or any new measures adopted  especially if they are such as can not be defeated by being made publick , and such as an uncommon degree of expense is necessary to support .


These principles , my lords , which I suppose no man will contest , have been so little regarded by the ministry on the present occasion , that they seem to have endeavoured to discover , by a bold experiment , to what degree of servility senates may be reduced , and what insults they will be taught to bear without resentment  for they have , without the least previous hint of their design , made a contract for a very numerous body of mercenaries , nor did they condescend to inform the senate , till they asked for money to pay them .


To execute measures first , and then to require the approbation of the senate , instead of advice , is surely such a degree of contempt as has not often been shown in the most arbitrary reigns , and such as would once have provoked such indignation in the other house , that there would have been no need in this of a motion like the present .


But , my lords , in proportion as the other house seems inclined to pay an implicit submission to the dictates of the ministry , it is our duty to increase our vigilance , and to convince our fellow-subjects , by a steady opposition to all encroachments , that we are not , as we have been sometimes styled , an useless assembly , but the last resort of liberty , and the chief support of the constitution .


The present design of those , who have thus dared to trample upon our privileges , appears to be nothing less than that of reducing the senates of Britain to the same abject slavery with those of France  to show the people that we are to be considered only as their agents , to raise the supplies which they shall be pleased , under whatever pretences , to demand , and to register such determinations as they shall condescend to lay before us .


This invasion of our rights , my lords , is too flagrant to be borne , though were the measures which we are thus tyrannically , required to support , really conducive in themselves to the interest of Britain , which , indeed , might reasonably have been expected  for what head can be imagined so ill formed for politicks as not to know , that the first acts of arbitrary power ought to be in themselves popular , that the advantage of the effect may be a balance to the means by which it is produced .


But these wonderful politicians , my lords , have heaped one blunder upon another  they have disgusted the nation both by the means and the end  and have insulted the senate with no other view than that of plundering the people .
They have ventured , without the consent of the senate , to pursue measures , of which it is obvious that they were only kept secret because they easily foresaw that they would not be approved .


For that the hire of mercenaries from Hanover , my lords , would have been rejected with general indignation  that the proposal would have produced hisses rather than censures  and that the arguments which have been hitherto used to support it , would , if personal regards did not make them of some importance , produce laughter oftener than replies , can not surely be doubted .


It has been said in vindication of this wise scheme , that no other troops could be obtained but those of Hanover  an assertion which I hope I may be allowed to examine , because it is yet a bare assertion without argument , and against probability  since it is generally known , how willingly the princes of Germany have on all former occasions sent out their subjects to destruction , that they might fill their coffers with their pay  nor do I doubt , but that there is now in the same country the usual superabundance of men , and the usual scarcity of money .
I make no question , my lords , that many a German prince would gladly furnish us with men as a very cheap commodity , and think himself sufficiently rewarded by a small subsidy .
There could be no objection to these troops from the constitution of the empire , which is not of equal force against the forces of Hanover  nor do I know why they should not rather have been employed , if they could have been obtained at a cheaper price .


The absurdity of paying levy-money for troops regularly kept up , and of hiring them at a higher rate than was ever paid for auxiliaries before , has been so strongly urged , and so fully explained , that no reply has been attempted by those who have hitherto opposed the motion  having rather endeavoured to divert our attention to foreign considerations , than to vindicate this part of the contract , which is , indeed , too shameful to be palliated , and too gross to be overlooked .


It is , however , proper to repeat , my lords , that though it can not be confuted , it may be forgotten in the multitude of other objects , that this nation , after having exalted the elector of Hanover from a state of obscurity to the crown , is condemned to hire the troops of Hanover to fight their own cause , to hire them at a rate which was never demanded for them before , and to pay levy-money for them , though it is known to all Europe , that they were not raised on this occasion .


Nor is this the only hardship or folly of this contract  for we are to pay them a month before they march into our service  we are to pay those for doing nothing , of whom it might have been , without any unreasonable expectations , hoped , that they would have exerted their utmost force without pay .


For it is apparent , my lords , that if the designs of France be such as the noble lords who oppose the motion represent them , Hanover is much nearer to danger than Britain  and , therefore , they only fight for their own preservation  since , though they have for a single year been blessed with a neutrality , it can not be imagined , that the same favour will be always granted them , or that the French , when they have overrun all the rest of Germany , will not annex Hanover to their other dominions .


Besides , my lords , it is well known , that Hanover is equally engaged by treaty with Britain to maintain the Pragmatick sanction , and that a certain proportion of troops are to be furnished .
But , my lords , as to the march of that body of forces , I have yet heard no account .
Will any lord say that they have marched ?
I , therefore , suppose , that the wisdom and justice of our ministers has comprehended them in the sixteen thousand who are to fatten upon British pay , and that Hanover will support the Pragmatick sanction at the cost of this inexhaustible nation .


The service which those troops have already done to the common cause , has been urged with great pomp of exaggeration , of which what effect it may have had upon others , I am not able to say  for my part , I am convinced , that the great happiness of this kingdom is the security of the established succession  and am , therefore , always of opinion , that no measures can serve the common cause , the cause of liberty , or of religion , or of general happiness , by which the royal family loses the affections of the people .
And I can with great confidence affirm , that no attempt for many years has raised a greater heat of resentment , or excited louder clamours of indignation , than the hire of Hanoverian troops  nor is this discontent raised only by artful misrepresentations , formed to inflame the passions , and perplex the understanding  it is a settled and rational dislike , which every day contributes to confirm , which will make all the measures of the government suspected , and may in time , if not obviated , break out in sedition .


A jealousy of Hanover has , indeed , for a long time prevailed in the nation .
The frequent visits of our kings to their electoral dominions , contrary to the original terms on which this crown was conferred upon them , have inclined the people of Britain to suspect , that they have only the second place in the affection of their sovereign  nor has this suspicion been made less by the large accessions made to those dominions by purchases , which the electors never appeared able to make before their exaltation to the throne of Britain , and by some measures which have been apparently taken only to aggrandize Hanover at the expense of Britain .


These measures , my lords , I am very far from imputing to our sovereign or his father  the wisdom of both is so well known , that they can not be imagined to have incurred , either by contempt or negligence , the disaffection of their subjects .
Those , my lords , are only to be blamed , who concealed from them the sentiments of the nation , and for the sake of promoting their own interest , betrayed them , by the most detestable and pernicious flattery , into measures which could produce no other effect than that of making their reign unquiet , and of exasperating those who had concurred with the warmest zeal in supporting them on the throne .


It is not without an uncommon degree of grief , that I hear it urged in defence of this contract , that it was approved by a very numerous council  for what can produce more sorrow in an honest and a loyal breast , than to find that our sovereign is surrounded by counsellors , who either do not know the desires and opinions of the people , or do not regard them  who are either so negligent as not to examine how the affections of the nation may be best preserved , or so rash as to pursue those schemes by which they hope to gratify the king at whatever hazard , and who for the sake of flattering him for a day , will risk the safety of his government , and the repose of his life .


It has , with regard to these troops , been asked by the noble lord who spoke last , what is the intent of this motion but to disband them ?
What else , indeed , can be intended by it , and what intention can be more worthy of this august assembly ?
By a steady pursuit of this intention , my lords , we shall regain the esteem of the nation , which this daring invasion of our privileges may be easily supposed to have impaired .
We shall give our sovereign an opportunity , by a gracious condescension to our desires , to recover those affections of which the pernicious advice of flatterers has deprived him  we shall obviate a precedent which threatens destruction to our liberties , and shall set the nation free from an universal alarm .
Nor in our present state is it to be mentioned as a trifling consideration , that we shall hinder the wealth of the nation from being ravished from our merchants , our farmers , and our manufacturers , to be squandered upon foreigners , and foreigners from whom we can hope for no advantage .


But it may be asked , my lords , how the great cause of liberty is to be supported , how the house of Austria is to be preserved from ruin , and how the ambition of France is to be repressed ?
How all this is to be effected , my lords , I am very far from conceiving myself qualified to determine  but surely it will be very little hindered by the dismission of troops , whose allegiance obliges them not to fight against the emperour , and of whom , therefore , it does not easily appear how they can be very useful allies to the queen of Hungary .


But whatever service is expected from them , it may surely , my lords , be performed by the same number of British troops  and that number may be sent to supply their place , without either delay or difficulty  I will venture to say , without any hazard .
If it be objected , as it has often been , that by sending out our troops , we shall leave our country naked to invasion , I hope I may be allowed to ask , who will invade us ?
The French are well known to be the only people whom we can suspect of any such design .
They have no fleet on this side of their kingdom , and their ships in the Mediterranean are blocked up in the harbour by the navies of Britain .
We shall still have at home a body of seven thousand men , which was thought a sufficient security in the late war , when the French had a fleet equal to our own .
Why we should now be in more danger from without , I can not discover  and with regard to intestine commotions , they will be prevented by compliance with the present motion .
For nothing can incite the people of Britain to oppose those who have openly dismissed the troops of Hanover .


But , my lords , I am not yet at all convinced , that the end for which those troops are said to be hired , ought to be pursued , or can be attained by us  and if the end be in itself improper or impossible , it certainly follows , that the means ought to be laid aside .


If we consider the present state of the continent , we shall find no prospect by which we can be encouraged to hazard our forces or our money .
The king of Sardinia has , indeed , declared for us , and opposed the passage of the Spaniards  but he appears either to be deficient in courage , or in prudence , or in force  for instead of giving battle on his frontiers , he has suffered them , with very little resistance , to invade his territories , to plunder and insult his subjects , and to live at his expense  and it may be suspected , that if he can not drive them out of his country , he will in time be content to purchase their departure , by granting them a passage through it , and rather give up the dominions of his ally to be ravaged , than preserve them at the expense of his own .


If we turn our eyes towards the Dutch , we shall not be more encouraged to engage in the wars on the continent  for whatever has been asserted of their readiness to proceed in conjunction with us , they appear hitherto to behold , with the most supine tranquillity , the subversion of the German system , and to be satisfied with an undisturbed enjoyment of their riches and their trade .
Nor is there any appearance , my lords , that their concurrence is withheld only by a single town , as has been insinuated  for the vote of any single town , except Amsterdam , may be overruled , and the resolution has passed the necessary form , when it is opposed by only one voice .


If we take a view , my lords , of their late conduct , without suffering our desires to mislead our understandings , we shall find no reason for imagining , that they propose any sudden alteration of their conduct , which has been hitherto consistent and steady , and appears to arise from established principles , which nothing has lately happened to incline them to forsake .


When they were solicited to become , like us , the guarantees of Hanover , they made no scruple of returning , with whatever unpoliteness , an absolute refusal  nor could they be prevailed upon to grant , what we appear to think that we were honoured in being admitted to bestow .
When they were called upon to fulfil their stipulation , and support the Pragmatick sanction , they evaded their own contract , till all assistance would have been too late , had not a lucky discovery of the French perfidy separated the king of Prussia from them  and what reason , my lords , can be given , why they should now do what they refused , when it might have been much more safely and more easily effected ?
Did they suffer the queen of Hungary to be oppressed , only to show their own power and affluence by relieving her ?
or can it be imagined , that pity has prevailed over policy or cowardice ?
They , who in contempt of their own treaties refused to engage in a cause while it was yet doubtful , will certainly think themselves justified in abandoning it when it is lost , and will urge , that no treaty can oblige them to act like madmen , or to undertake impossibilities .


I am , therefore , convinced , my lords , that they will not enter into an offensive treaty , and that they have only engaged to do what their own interest required from them , without any new stipulation , to preserve their own country from invasion by sending garrisons into the frontier towns , which they may do without any offence to France , or any interruption of their own tranquillity .


Many other treaties have been mentioned , my lords , and mentioned with great ostentation , as the effects of consummate policy , which will , I suspect , appear to be at least only defensive treaties , by which the contracting powers promise little more than to take care of themselves .


In this state of the world , my lords , when all the powers of the continent appear benumbed by a lethargy , or shackled by a panick , to what purpose should we lavish , in hiring and transporting troops , that wealth which contests of nearer importance immediately require ?


It is well known to our merchants , whose ships are every day seized by privateers , that we are at war with Spain , and that our commerce is every day impaired by the depredations of an enemy , whom only our own negligence enables to resist us  but I doubt , my lords , whether it is known in Spain , that their monarch is at war with Britain , otherwise than by the riches of our nation , which are distributed among their privateers , and the prisoners who in the towns on the coast are wandering in the streets .
For I know no inconvenience which they can be supposed to feel from our hostilities , nor in what part of the world the war against them is carried on .
Before the war was declared , it is well remembered by whom , and with how great vehemence , it was every day repeated , that to end the war with honour we ought to take and hold .
What , my lords , do we hold , or what have we taken ?
What has the war produced in its whole course from one year to another , but defeats , losses , and ignominy ?
And how shall we regain our honour , or retrieve our wealth , by engaging in another war more dangerous but less necessary ?
We ought surely to humble Spain , before we presume to attack France  and we may attack France with better prospects of success , when we have no other enemy to divert our attention , or divide our forces .


That we ought , indeed , to make any attempt upon France , I am far from being convinced , because I do not now discover , that any of the motives subsist which engaged us in the last confederacy .
The house of Austria , though overborne and distressed , was then powerful in itself , and possessed of the imperial crown .
It is now reduced almost below the hopes of recovery , and we are therefore now to restore what we were then only to support .
But what , my lords , is in my opinion much more to be considered , the nation was then unanimous in one general resolution to repress the insolence of France  no hardships were insupportable that conduced to this great end , nor any taxes grievous that were applied to the support of the war .
The account of a victory was esteemed as an equivalent to excises and to publick debts  and the possessions of us and our posterity were cheerfully mortgaged to purchase a triumph over the common enemy .
But , my lords , the disposition of the nation with regard to the present war is very different .
They discover no danger threatening them , they are neither invaded in their possessions by the armies , nor interrupted in their commerce by the fleets of France  and therefore they are not able to find out why they must be sacrificed to an enemy , by whom they have been long pursued with the most implacable hatred , for the sake of attacking a power from which they have hitherto felt no injury , and which they believe can not be provoked without danger , nor opposed without such a profusion of expense as the publick is at present not able to bear .


It is not to be supposed , my lords , that the bulk of the British people are affected with the distresses , or inflamed by the magnanimity of the queen of Hungary .
This illustrious daughter of Austria , whose name has been so often echoed in these walls , and of whom I am far from denying , that she deserves our admiration , our compassion , and all the assistance which can be given her , consistently with the regard due to the safety of our own country , is to the greatest part of the people an imaginary princess , whose sufferings or whose virtues make no other impression upon them , than those which are recorded in fictitious narratives  nor can they easily be persuaded to give up for her relief the produce of their lands , or the profits of their commerce .


Some , indeed , there are , my lords , whose views are more extensive , and whose sentiments are more exalted  for it is not to be supposed , that either knowledge or generosity are confined to the senate or the court : but these , my lords , though they perhaps may more readily approve the end which the ministry pretends to pursue , are less satisfied with the means by which they endeavour to attain it .
By these men it is easily discovered , that the hopes which some so confidently express of prevailing upon the Dutch to unite with us for the support of the Pragmatick sanction , are without foundation  they see that their consent to place garrisons in the frontier towns , however it may furnish a subject of exultation to those whose interest it is to represent them as ready to concur with us , is only a new proof of what was never doubted , their unvariable attention to their own interest , since they must for their own security preserve their own barrier from being seized by France .
By this act they incur no new expense , they provoke no enemies , nor give any assistance to the queen of Hungary , by which they can raise either resentment in one part , or gratitude in the other  and therefore it is not hard to perceive that , whatever is pretended , the Dutch hitherto observe the most exact laws of neutrality  and it is too evident , that if they refuse their assistance , we have very little to hope from a war with France .


Nor is this the only objection against the present measures  for it is generally , and not without sufficient reason suspected , that the real assistance of the queen of Hungary is not intended , since the troops which have been hired under that pretence , are such as can not march against the emperour .
It is known , that the Hessians have absolutely refused to infringe the constitution of the German body , by attacking him who is by a legal grant acknowledged its head  nor is it easy to conceive , why there should be a different law for Hanover than for the other electorates .


The long stay of the troops in Flanders , a place where there is no enemy to encounter , nor ally to assist , is a sufficient proof that there is nothing more designed than that the troops of Hanover shall loiter on the verge of war , and receive their pay for feasting in their quarters , and showing their arms at a review  and that they in reality design nothing but to return home with full pockets , and enjoy the spoils of Britain .


There may , indeed , be another reason , my lords , which hinders the progress of the united forces , and by which the Britons and Hanoverians may be both affected , though not both in the same degree .
It is by no means unlikely , that the king of Prussia has forbidden them to advance , and declared , that the king who was chosen by his suffrage shall be supported by his arms  if this be his resolution , he is well known to want neither spirit nor strength to avow and support it  and there are reasons sufficient to convince us , that he has declared it , and that our troops are now patiently waiting the event of a negotiation by which we are endeavouring to persuade him to alter his design , if , indeed , it be desired that he should alter it  for it is not certain , that the elector of Hanover can desire the restoration of the house of Austria to an hereditary enjoyment of the imperial dignity  nor can it easily be shown why the politicks of one house , should differ from those of all the other princes of the German empire .


The other princes , my lords , have long wished for a king with whom they might treat upon the level  a king who might owe his dignity only to their votes , and who , therefore , would be willing to favour them in gratitude for the benefit .
They know , that the princes of the house of Austria considered their advancement to the empire as the consequence of their numerous forces and large dominions , and made use of their exaltation only to tyrannise under the appearance of legal right , and to oppress those as sovereigns , whom they would otherwise have harassed as conquerors .


Before we can , therefore , hope for the concurrence of the princes of the empire , we must inform them of our design , if any design has been yet laid out .
Is it your intention to restore the house of Austria to the full enjoyment of its former greatness ?
This will certainly be openly opposed by all those powers who are strong enough to make head against it , and secretly obstructed by those , whose weakness makes them afraid of publick declarations .
Do you intend to support the Pragmatick sanction ?
This can only be done by defeating the whole power of France  and for this you must necessarily provide troops who shall dare to act against the present king .
So that it appears , my lords , that we are attempting nothing , or attempting impossibilities  that either we have no end in view , or that we have made use of an absurd choice of means by which it can not be attained .


Whatever be our design with regard to Germany , the war against Spain is evidently neglected  and , indeed , one part of our conduct proves at once , that we intend neither to assist the Austrians , nor to punish the Spaniards  since we have in a great measure disabled ourselves from either by the neutrality which captain Martin is said to have granted , and by which we have allowed an asylum both to the troops of Spain , which shall fly before the Austrians , and the privateers which shall be chased by our ships in the Mediterranean .


I am , therefore , convinced , my lords , that our designs are not such as they are represented , or that they will not be accomplished by the measures taken .
I am convinced in a particular manner , that the troops of Hanover can be of no use , and that they will raise the resentment of the nation , already overwhelmed with unnecessary burdens .
I know , likewise , that they have been taken into pay without the consent of the senate , and am convinced , that if no other objection could be raised , we ought not to ratify a treaty which the crown has made , without laying it before us in the usual manner .
I need not , therefore , inform your lordships , that I think the motion now under your consideration necessary and just  and that I hope , upon an attentive examination of the reasons which have been offered , your lordships will concur in it with that unanimity which evidence ought to enforce , and that zeal which ought to be excited by publick danger .


To which the duke of NEWCASTLE made answer to the following purport : -- My lords , I know not by what imaginary appearances of publick danger the noble lord is so much alarmed , nor what fears they are which he endeavours with so much art and zeal to communicate to this assembly .
For my part , I can upon the most attentive survey of our affairs , discover nothing to be feared but calumnies and misrepresentations  and these I shall henceforward think more formidable , since they have been able to impose upon an understanding so penetrating as that of his lordship , and have prevailed upon him to believe what is not only false , but without the appearance of truth , and to believe it so firmly , as to assert it to your lordships .


One of the facts which he has thus implicitly received , and thus publickly mentioned , is the neutrality supposed to have been granted to the king of Sicily , from which he has amused himself and your lordships with deducing very destructive consequences , that perhaps need not to be allowed him , even upon supposition of the neutrality  but which need not now be disputed , because no neutrality has been granted .
Captain Martin , when he treated with the king , very cautiously declined any declarations of the intentions of the British court on that particular , and confined himself to the subject of his message , without giving any reason for hope , or despair of a neutrality .
So that if it shall be thought necessary , we are this hour at liberty to declare war against the king of Sicily , and may pursue the Spaniards with the same freedom on his coasts as on those of any other power , and prohibit any assistance from being given by him to their armies in Italy .


His lordship 's notion of the interposition of the king of Prussia in the king 's favour , is another phantom raised by calumny to terrify credulity  a phantom which will , I hope , be entirely dissipated , when I have informed the house , that the whole suspicion is without foundation , and that the king of Prussia has made no declaration of any design to support the king , or of opposing us in the performance of our treaties .
This prince , my lords , however powerful , active , or ambitious , appears to be satisfied with his acquisitions , and willing to rest in an inoffensive neutrality .


Such , my lords , and so remote from truth are the representations which the enemies of the government have with great zeal and industry scattered over the nation , and by which they have endeavoured to obviate those schemes which they would seem to favour  for by sinking the nation to a despair of attaining those ends which they declare at the same time necessary not only to our happiness , but to our preservation , what do they less than tell us , that we must be content to look unactive on the calamities that approach us , and prepare to be crushed by that ruin which we can not prevent ?


From this cold dejection , my lords , arises that despair which so many lords have expressed , of prevailing upon the Dutch to unite with us .
The determinations of that people are , indeed , always slow , and the reason of their slowness has been already given  but I am informed , that the general spirit which now reigns among them , is likely soon to overrule the particular interests of single provinces , and can produce letters by which it will appear , that had only one town opposed those measures to which their concurrence is now solicited , it had been long since overruled  for there want not among them men equally enamoured of the magnanimity and firmness of the queen of Hungary , equally zealous for the general good of mankind , equally zealous for the liberties of Europe , and equally convinced of the perfidy , the ambition , and the insolence of France , with any lord in this assembly .


These men , my lords , have long endeavoured to rouse their country from the sloth of avarice , and the slumber of tranquillity , to a generous and extensive regard for the universal happiness of mankind  and are now labouring in the general assembly to communicate that ardour with which they are themselves inflamed , and to excite that zeal for publick faith , of which their superiour knowledge shows them the necessity .


It has been , indeed , insinuated , that all their consultations tend only to place garrisons in those towns from which the queen of Hungary has withdrawn her forces  but this supposition , my lords , as it is without any support from facts , is , likewise , without probability .
For to garrison the barrier towns requires no previous debates nor deliberations  since it never was opposed even by those by whom the assistance of the queen of Hungary has been most retarded .
Nor have even the deputies of Dort , whose obstinacy has been most remarkable , denied the necessity of securing the confines of their country , by possessing with their own troops those places which the Austrians are obliged to forsake .
Their present disputes , my lords , must be , therefore , on some other question  and what question can be now before them which can produce any difficulties , but that which regards the support of the Pragmatick sanction ?


If these deliberations should be so far influenced by the arrival of the army in the pay of Britain , as to end in a resolution to send a sufficient number of forces into Germany , it will not be denied , that the troops which give occasion for this debate , have really been useful to the common cause  nor will his majesty lose the affections of any of his subjects , by the false accounts which have been spread of an invidious preference given to the troops of Hanover .


That every government ought to endeavour to gain the esteem and confidence of the people , I suppose we are all equally convinced  but I , for my part , am very far from thinking that measures ought only to be pursued or rejected , as they are immediately favoured or disliked by the populace .
For as they can not know either the causes or the end of publick transactions , they can judge only from fallacious appearances , or the information of those whose interest it may perhaps be to lead them away from the truth .
That monarch will be most certainly and most permanently popular , who steadily pursues the good of his people , even in opposition to their own prejudices and clamours  who disregards calumnies , which , though they may prevail for a day , time will sufficiently confute , and slights objections which he knows may be answered , and answered beyond reply .


Such , my lords , are the objections which have been hitherto raised against the troops of Hanover , of which many arise from ignorance , and many from prejudice  and some may be supposed to be made only for the sake of giving way to invectives , and indulging a petulant inclination of speaking contemptuously of Hanover .


With this view , my lords , it has been asked , why the Hanoverians are preferred to all other nations ?
why they have been selected from all other troops , to fight , against France , the cause of Europe ?
They were chosen , my lords , because they were most easily to be procured .
Of the other nations from whom forces have usually been hired , some were engaged in the care of protecting , or the design of extending their own dominions , and others had no troops levied , nor could , therefore , furnish them with speed enough for the exigence that demanded them .


It has been asked with an air of triumph , as a question to which no answer could be given , why an equal number of Britons was not sent , since their valour might be esteemed at least equal to that of Hanoverians ?
I am far , my lords , from intending to diminish the reputation of the British courage , or detract from that praise which has been gained by such gallant enterprises , and preserved by a long succession of dangers , and of victories  nor do I expect that any nation will ever form a just claim to superiority .
The reason , therefore , my lords , for which the troops of Hanover were hired , was not that the bravery of our countrymen was doubted , but that the transportation of such numbers might leave us naked to the insults of an enemy .
For though the noble lord has declared , that after having sent sixteen thousand into Flanders , we should still have reserved for our defence a body of seven thousand , equal to that to which the protection of this kingdom was intrusted in the late war , his opinion will upon examination be found to have arisen only from the enumeration of the names of our regiments , many of which are far from being complete , and some almost merely nominal  so that , perhaps , if a body of sixteen thousand more had been sent , there would not have remained a single regiment to have repelled the crew of any daring privateer that should have landed to burn our villages , and ravage the defenceless country .


It was desired , my lords , by the queen of Hungary , that a British army might appear on the continent in her favour , for she knew the reputation and terrour of our arms  and as her demand was equitable in itself , and honourable to the nation , it was complied with  and as many of our native troops were sent , as it was thought convenient to spare , the rest were necessarily to be hired  and it is the business of those lords who defend the motion , to show from whence they could be called more properly than from Hanover .


It has been urged with great warmth , that the contract made for these troops has not been laid before the senate , a charge which the noble lord who spoke last but one , has shown to be ill grounded  because the former determinations of the senate enabled the crown to garrison the frontier towns without any new deliberations , but which may be , perhaps , more satisfactorily confuted by showing , that it is an accusation of neglecting that which was in reality not possible to be performed , or which at least could not be performed without subjecting the government to imputations yet more dangerous than those which it now suffers .


The accounts , my lords , by which the ministry were determined to send the army into Flanders , arrived only fifteen days before the recess of the senate  nor was the resolution formed , as it may easily be imagined , till several days after  so that there was very little time for senatorial deliberations , nor was it , perhaps , convenient to publish at that time the whole scheme of our designs .


But let us suppose , my lords , that the senate had , a few days before they rose , been consulted , and that a vote of credit had been required to enable the crown to hire forces during the interval of the sessions , what would those by whom this motion is supported have urged against it ?
Would they not with great appearance of reason have alleged the impropriety of such an application to the thin remains of a senate , from which almost all those had retired , whom their employments did not retain in the neighbourhood of the court ?
Would it not have been echoed from one corner of these kingdoms to another , that the ministry had betrayed their country by a contract which they durst not lay before a full senate , and of which they would trust the examination only to those whom they had hired to approve it .
Would not this have been generally asserted , and generally believed ?
Would not those who distinguished themselves as the opponents of the court , have urged , that the king ought to exert his prerogative , and trust the equity of the senate for the approbation of his measures , and the payment of the troops which he had retained for the support of the common cause , the cause for which so much zeal had been expressed , and for which it could not with justice be suspected , that any reasonable demands would be denied ?
Would not the solicitation of a grant of power without limits , to be exerted wholly at the discretion of the ministry , be censured as a precedent of the utmost danger , which it was the business of every man to oppose , who had not lost all regard to the constitution of his country ?


These insinuations , my lords , were foreseen and allowed by the ministry to be specious , and , therefore , they determined to avoid them by pursuing their schemes at their own hazard , without any other security than the consciousness of the rectitude of their own designs  and to trust to the equity of the senate when they should be laid before them , at a time when part of their effects might be discovered , and when , therefore , no false representations could be used to mislead their judgment .
They knew the zeal of the commons for the great cause of universal liberty  they knew that their measures had no other tendency than the promotion of that cause , and , therefore , they confidently formed those expectations which have not deceived them , that the pay of the troops would be readily granted , and ordered them , therefore , to march  though if the commons had disapproved their plan , they must have returned into their own country , or have been supported at the expense of the electorate .


The objections raised against these troops , have apparently had no influence in the other house , because supplies have been granted for their pay  and I believe they will , upon examination , be found by your lordships not to deserve much regard .


It is asserted , that they can not act against the emperour , established and acknowledged by the diet , without subjecting their country to an interdict  and it was , therefore , suspected , that they would in reality be of no use .
This suspicion , my lords , I suppose , it is now not necessary to censure , since you have heard from his majesty , that they are preparing to march  and as the consequences of their conduct can only affect the electorate , its propriety or legality with regard to the constitution of the empire , falls not properly under our consideration .


How his majesty 's measures may be defended , even in this view , I suppose I need not inform any of this assembly .
It is well known , that the emperour was chosen not by the free consent of the diet , in which every elector voted according to his own sense , but by a diet in which one vote of the empire was suspended without any regard to law or justice , and in which the rest were extorted by a French army , which threatened immediate ruin to him who should refuse his consent .
The emperour thus chosen , was likewise afterwards recognised by the same powers , upon the same motives , and the aid was granted as the votes were given by the influence of the armies of France .


For this reason , my lords , the queen of Hungary still refuses to give the elector of Bavaria the style and honours which belong to the imperial dignity  she considers the throne as still vacant , and requires that it should be filled by an uninfluenced election .


It has been observed , my lords , that his majesty gave his vote to the elector of Bavaria  and it has been , therefore , represented as an inconsistency in his conduct , that he should make war against him .
But , my lords , it will by no means follow , that because he voted for him he thinks him lawfully elected , nor that it is unjust to dispossess him  though it is to be observed , that we are not making war to dethrone the emperour , however elected , but to support the Pragmatick sanction .


This observation , though somewhat foreign from the present debate , I have thought it not improper to lay before your lordships , that no scruples might remain in the most delicate and scrupulous , and to show that the measures of his majesty can not be justly charged with inconsistency .


But this , my lords , is not the only , nor the greatest benefit which the queen of Hungary has received from these troops  for it is highly probable , that the states will be induced to concur in the common cause , when they find that they are not incited to a mock confederacy , when they perceive that we really intend to act vigorously , that we decline neither expense nor danger , and that a compliance with our demands will not expose them to stand alone and unassisted against the power of France , elated by success , and exasperated by opposition .


If this , my lords , should be the consequence of our measures , and this consequence is , perhaps , not far distant , it will no longer be , I hope , asserted , that these mercenaries are an useless burden to the nation , that they are of no advantage to the common cause , or that the people have been betrayed by the ministry into expenses , merely that Hanover might be enriched .
When the grand confederacy is once revived , and revived by any universal conviction of the destructive measures , the insatiable ambition , and the outrageous cruelty of the French , what may not the friends of liberty presume to expect ?
May they not hope , my lords , that those haughty troops which have been so long employed in conquests and invasions , that have laid waste the neighbouring countries with slaughters and devastations , will be soon compelled to retire to their own frontiers , and be content to guard the verge of their native provinces ?
May we not hope , that they will soon be driven from their posts  that they will be forced to retreat to a more defensible station , and admit the armies of their enemies into their dominions  and that they will be pursued from fortress to fortress , and from one intrenchment to another , till they shall be reduced to petition for peace , and purchase it by the alienation of part of their territories .


I hope , my lords , it may be yet safely asserted that the French , however powerful , are not invincible  that their armies may be destroyed , and their treasures exhausted  that they may , therefore , be reduced to narrow limits , and disabled from being any longer the disturbers of the peace of the universe .


It is well known , my lords , that their wealth is not the product of their own country  that gold is not dug out of their mountains , or rolled down their rivers  but that it is gained by an extensive and successful commerce , carried on in many parts of the world , to the diminution of our own .
It is known , likewise , that trade can not be continued in war , without the protection of naval armaments  and that our fleet is at present superiour in strength to those of the greatest part of the universe united .
It is , therefore , reasonably to be hoped , that though by assisting the house of Austria we should provoke the French to declare war against us , their hostilities would produce none of those calamities which seem to be dreaded by part of this assembly  and that such a confederacy might be formed as would be able to retort all the machinations of France upon herself , as would tear her provinces from her , and annex them to other sovereignties .


It has been urged , that no such success can be expected from the conduct which we have lately pursued  that we , who are thus daring the resentment of the most formidable power in the universe , have long suffered ourselves to be insulted by an enemy of far inferiour force  that we have been defeated in all our enterprises , and have at present appeared to desist from any design of hostilities  that the Spaniards scarcely perceive that they have an enemy , or feel , any of the calamities or inconveniencies of war  and that they are every day enriched with the plunder of Britain , without danger , and without labour .


That the war against Spain has not hitherto been remarkably successful , must be confessed  and though the Spaniards can not boast of any other advantages than the defence of their own dominions , yet they may , perhaps , be somewhat elated , as they have been able to hold out against an enemy superiour to themselves .
But , my lords , I am far from believing , that they consider the war against us as an advantage , or that they do not lament it as one of the heaviest calamities that could fall upon them .
If it be asked , in what part of their dominions they feel any effects of our hostility , I shall answer with great confidence , that they feel them in every part which is exposed to the evils of a naval war  that they are in pain wherever they are sensible  that they are wounded wherever they are not sheltered from our blows , by the interposition of the nations of the continent .


If we examine , my lords , the influence of our European armaments , we shall find that their ships of war are shut up in the harbour of France , and that the fleets of both nations are happily blocked up together , so that they can neither extricate each other by concerted motions , in which our attention might be distracted , and our force divided , nor by their united force break through the bars by which they are shut up from the use of the ocean .


But this , my lords , however important with respect to us , is perhaps the smallest inconvenience which the Spaniards feel from our naval superiority .
They have an army , my lords , in Italy , exposed to all the miseries of famine , while our fleet prohibits the transportation of those provisions which have been stored in vessels for their supply , and which must be probably soon made defenceless by the want of ammunition , and fall into the hands of their enemies without the honour of a battle .


But what to the pride of a Spaniard must be yet a more severe affliction , they have on the same continent a natural confederate , who is yet so intimidated by the British fleets , that he dares neither afford them refuge in his dominions , nor send his troops to their assistance .
The queen , amidst all the schemes which her unbounded ambition forms for the exaltation of her family , finds her own son , after having received a kingdom from her kindness , restrained from supporting her , and reduced to preserve those territories which she has bestowed upon him , by abandoning her from whom he received them .


These , my lords , are the inconveniencies which the Spaniards feel from our fleets in the Mediterranean  and even these , however embarrassing , however depressing , are lighter than those which our American navy produces .
It is apparent , that money is equivalent to strength , a proposition of which , if it could be doubted , the Spanish monarchy would afford sufficient proof , as it has been for a long time supported only by the power of riches .
It is , therefore , impossible to weaken Spain more speedily or more certainly , than by intercepting or obstructing the annual supplies of gold and silver which she receives from her American provinces , by which she was once enabled to threaten slavery to all the neighbouring nations , and incited to begin , with the subjection of this island , her mighty scheme of universal monarchy , and by which she has still continued to exalt herself to an equality with the most powerful nations , to erect new kingdoms , and set at defiance the Austrian power .


These supplies , my lords , are now , if not wholly , yet in a great measure , withheld  and by all the efforts which the Spaniards now make , they are exhausting their vitals , and wasting the natural strength of their native country .
While they made war with adventitious treasures , and only squandered one year what another would repay them , it was not easy to foresee how long their pride would incline them to hold out against superiour strength .
While they were only engaged in a naval war , they might have persisted for a long time in a kind of passive obstinacy  and while they were engaged in no foreign enterprises , might have supported that trade with each other which is necessary for the support of life , upon the credit of those treasures which are annually heaped up in their storehouses , though they are not received  and by which , upon the termination of the war , all their debts might at once be paid , and all their funds be reestablished .


But at present , my lords , their condition is far different  they have been tempted by the prospect of enlarging their dominions to raise armies for distant expeditions , which must be supported in a foreign country , and can be supported only by regular remittances of treasure , and have formed these projects at a time when the means of pursuing them are cut off .
They have by one war increased their expenses , when their receipts are obstructed by another .


In this state , my lords , I am certain the Spaniards are very far from thinking the hostility of Britain merely nominal , and from inquiring in what part of the world their enemies are to be found .
The troops in Italy see them sailing in triumph over the Mediterranean , intercepting their provisions , and prohibiting those succours which they expected from their confederate of Sicily .
In Spain their taxes and their poverty , poverty which every day increases , inform them that the seas of America are possessed by the fleets of Britain , by whom their mines are made useless , and their wealthy dominions reduced to an empty sound .
They may , indeed , comfort themselves in their distresses with the advantages which their troops have gained over the king of Sardinia , and with the entrance which they have forced into his dominions  but this can afford them no long satisfaction , since they will , probably , never be able to break through the passes at which they have arrived , or to force their way into Italy  and must perish at the feet of inaccessible rocks , where they are now supported at such an expense that they are more burdensome to their own master than to the king of Sardinia .


Of this prince , I know not why , it has been asserted that he will probably violate his engagements to Britain and Austria  that he will purchase peace by perfidy , and grant a passage to the army of Spain .
His conduct has certainly given , hitherto , no reason for such an imputation  he has opposed them with fortitude , and vigour , and address  nor has he failed in any of the duties required of a general or an ally  he has exposed his person to the most urgent dangers , and his dominions to the ravages of war  he has rejected all the solicitations of France , and set her menaces at defiance  and surely , my lords , if no private man ought to be censured without just reason , even in familiar discourse , we ought still to be more cautious of injuring the reputation of princes by publick reproaches in the solemn debates of national assemblies .


The same licentiousness of speech has not , indeed , been extended to all the princes mentioned in this debate .
The emperour has been treated with remarkable decency as the lawful sovereign of Germany , as one who can not be opposed without rebellion , and against whom we , therefore , can not expect that the troops of Hanover should presume to act , since they must expose their country to the severities of the imperial interdict .


The noble lords who have thus ardently asserted the rights of the emperour , who have represented in such strong language the crime of violating the German constitutions , and have commended the neutrality of the king of Prussia , as proper to be imitated by all the rest of the princes ` of the empire , have forgotten , or hoped that others Would forget , the injustice and violence by which he exalted himself to the throne , from which they appear to think it a sacrilegious attempt to endeavour to thrust him down .
They forget that one of the votes was illegally suspended , and that the rest were extorted by the terrour of an army .
They forget that he invited the French into the empire , and that he is guilty of all the ravages which have been committed and all the blood that has been shed , since the death of the emperour , in the defence of the Pragmatick sanction which he invaded , though ratified by the solemn consent of the imperial diet .


In defence of the Pragmatick sanction , my lords , which all the princes of the empire , except his majesty , saw violated without concern , are we now required to exert our force  we are required only to perform what we promised by the most solemn treaties , which , though they have been broken by the cowardice or ambition of other powers , it will be our greatest honour to observe with exemplary fidelity .


With this view , as your lordships have already been informed , the Hanoverian troops will march into the empire  nor has their march been hitherto delayed , either because there was yet no regular scheme projected , or because they were obliged to wait for the permission of the king of Prussia , or because they intended only to amuse Europe with an empty show : they were detained , my lords , in Flanders , because it was believed that they were more useful there than they would be in any other place , because they at once encouraged the states , alarmed the French , defended the Low Countries , and kept the communication open between the queen 's dominions and those of her allies .
Nor were these advantages , my lords , chimerical , and such as are only suggested by a warm imagination  for it is evident that by keeping their station in those countries they have changed the state of the war , that they have protected the queen of Hungary from being oppressed by a new army of French , and given her an opportunity of establishing herself in the possession of Bavaria  that the French forces , instead of being sent either to the assistance of the king of Spain against the king of Sardinia , or of the emperour , for the recovery of those dominions which he has lost by an implicit confidence in their alliance , have been necessarily drawn down to the opposite extremity of their dominions , where they are of no use either to their own country , or to their confederates .
The united troops of Britain and Hanover , therefore , carried on the war , by living at ease in their quarters in Flanders , more efficaciously than if they had marched immediately into Bavaria or Bohemia .


Thus , my lords , I have endeavoured to show the justice of our designs , and the usefulness of the measures by which we have endeavoured to execute them  and doubt not but your lordships will , upon considering the arguments which have been urged on either side , and those which your own reflections will suggest , allow that it was not only just but necessary to take into our pay the troops of Hanover , for the support of the Pragmatick sanction , and the preservation of the house of Austria  and that since the same reasons which induced the government to hire them , still make it necessary to retain them , you will prefer the general happiness of Europe , the observation of publick faith , and the security of our own liberties and those of our posterity , to a small alleviation of our present expenses , and unanimously reject a motion , which has no other tendency than to resign the world into the hands of the French , and purchase a short and dependant tranquillity by the loss of all those blessings which make life desirable .


Lord LONSDALE spoke next to the following effect : -- My lords , notwithstanding the confidence with which the late measures of the government have been defended by their authors , I am not yet set free from the scruples which my own observations had raised , and which have been strengthened by the assertions of those noble lords , who have spoken in vindication of the motion .


Many of the objections which have been raised and enforced with all the power of argument , have yet remained unanswered , or those answers which have been offered are such as leave the argument in its full strength .
Many of the assertions which have been produced seem the effects of hope rather than conviction , and we are rather told what we are to hope from future measures , than what advantages we have received from the past .


I am , indeed , one of those whom it will be difficult to convince of the propriety of engaging in a new war , when we are unsuccessful in that which we have already undertaken , and of provoking a more powerful enemy , when all our attempts are baffled by a weaker  and can not yet set myself free from the apprehension of new defeats and new disgraces from the arms of France , after having long seen how little we are able to punish the insolence of Spain .
I can not but fear that by an ill-timed and useless opposition to schemes which , however destructive or unjust , we can not obviate , we shall subject ourselves to numberless calamities , that the ocean will be covered with new fleets of privateers , that our commerce will be interrupted in every part of the world , and that we shall only provoke France to seize what she would at least have spared some time longer .


But , my lords , if it be granted , that the Pragmatick sanction is obligatory to us , though it is violated by every other power  that we should labour to reduce the powers of Europe to an equipoise , whenever accident or folly produces any alteration of the balance  and that we are now not to preserve the house of Austria from falling , but raise it from the dust , and restore it to its ancient splendour , even at the hazard of a war with that power which now gives laws to all the western nations  yet it will not surely be asserted , that we ought to be without limits , that we ought to preserve the house of Austria , not only by the danger of our own country , but by its certain ruin , and endeavour to avert the possibility of slavery , by subjecting ourselves to miseries more severe than the utmost arrogance of conquest , or the most cruel wantonness of tyranny , would inflict upon us .


I have observed , that many lords have expressed in this debate an uncommon ardour for the support of the queen of Hungary  nor is it without pleasure , that I see the most laudable of all motives , justice and compassion , operate in this great assembly with so much force .
May your lordships always continue to stand the great advocates for publick faith , and the patrons of true greatness in distress  may magnanimity always gain your regard , and calamity find shelter under your protection .


I , likewise , my lords , desire to be remembered among those who reverence the virtues and pity the miseries of this illustrious princess , who look with detestation on those who have invaded the dominions which they had obliged themselves by solemn treaties to defend , and who have taken advantage of the general confederacy against her , to enrich themselves with her spoils , who have insulted her distress and aggravated her misfortunes .


But , my lords , while I feel all these sentiments of compassion for the queen of Hungary , I have not yet been able to forget , that my own country claims a nearer regard  that I am obliged both by interest and duty to preserve myself and my posterity , and my fellow-subjects , from those miseries which I lament  when they happen to others , however distant , I can not but remember , that I am not to save another from destruction by destroying myself , nor to rescue Austria by the ruin of Britain .


Though I am , therefore , my lords , not unwilling to assist the queen of Hungary , I think it necessary to fix the limits of our regard , to inquire how far we may proceed with safety , and what expenses the nation can bear , and how those expenses may be best employed .
The danger of the queen of Hungary ought not to have an effect which would be reproachful , even if the danger was our own .
It ought not so far to engross our faculties as to hinder us from attending to every other object .
The man who runs into a greater evil to avoid a less , evidently shows that he is defective either in prudence or in courage  that either he wants the natural power of distinguishing , or that his dread of an approaching , or his impatience of a present evil , has taken it away .


Let us , therefore , examine , my lords , the measures with which those who are intrusted with the administration of publick affairs , would persuade us to concur , and inquire whether they are such as can be approved by us without danger to our country .
Let us consider , my lords , yet more nearly , whether they are not such as we ourselves could not be prevailed upon even to regard as the object of deliberation , were we not dazzled on one part by glaring prospects of triumphs and honours , of the reduction of France , and the rescue of the world  of the propagation of liberty , and the defence of religion  and intimidated on the other by the view of approaching calamities , the cruelties of persecution , and the hardships of slavery .


All the arts of exaggeration , my lords , have been practised to reconcile us to the measures which are now proposed , and , indeed , all are necessary  for the expenses to which we are about to condemn this nation , are such as it is not able to bear , and to which no lord in this house would consent , were he calm enough to number the sums .


To prove the truth of this assertion , one question is necessary .
Is any lord in this assembly willing to assist the queen of Hungary at the expense of sixteen hundred thousand a year ?
I think the universal silence of this assembly is a sufficient proof , that no one is willing  I will , however , repeat my question .
Is any lord in this assembly willing that this nation should assist the queen of Hungary at the annual expense of sixteen hundred thousand pounds ?
The house is , as I expected , still silent , and , therefore , I may now safely proceed upon the supposition of an unanimous negative .
Nor does any thing remain in order to evince the impropriety of the measures which we are about to pursue , but that every lord may reckon up the sum required for the support of those troops .
Let him take a view of our military estimates , and he will quickly be convinced , how much we are condemned to suffer in this cause .
He will find , that we are about not only to remit yearly into a foreign country more than a million and a half of money , but to hazard the lives of multitudes of our fellow-subjects , in a quarrel which at most affects us but remotely  that we are about to incur as auxiliaries an expense greater than that which the principals sustain .


The sum which I have mentioned , my lords , enormous as it may appear , is by no means exaggerated beyond the truth .
Whoever shall examine the common military estimates , will easily be convinced , that the forces which we now maintain upon the continent can not be supported at less expense  and that we are , therefore , about to exhaust our country in a distant quarrel , and to lavish our blood and treasure with useless profusion .


This profusion , my lords , is useless , at least useless to any other end , than an ostentatious display of our forces , and our riches  not because the balance of power is irrecoverably destroyed , not because it is contrary to the natural interest of an island to engage in wars on the continent , nor because we shall lose more by the diminution of our commerce , than we shall gain by an annual victory .
It is useless , not because the power of France has by long negligence been suffered to swell beyond all opposition , nor because the queen of Hungary ought not to be assisted at the hazard of this kingdom , though all these reasons are of importance enough to claim our consideration .
It is useless , my lords , because the queen of Hungary may be assisted more powerfully , at less charge  because a third part of this sum will enable her to raise , and to maintain , a greater body of men than have now been sent her .


Nor will the troops which she may be thus enabled to raise , my lords , be only more numerous , but more likely to prosecute the war with ardour  and to conclude it , therefore , with success .
They will fight for the preservation of their own country , they will draw their swords to defend their houses and their estates , their wives and their children from the rage of tyrants and invaders  they will enter the field as men who can not leave it to their enemies , without resigning all that makes life valuable  and who will , therefore , more willingly die than turn their backs .


It may reasonably be imagined , my lords , that the queen will place more confidence in such forces , than in troops which are to fight only for honour or for pay  and that she will expect from the affection of her own subjects , a degree of zeal and constancy which she can not hope to excite in foreigners  and that she will think herself more secure in the protection of those whose fidelity she may secure by the solemnity of an oath , than those who have no particular regard for her person , nor any obligations to support her government .


It is no inconsiderable motive to this method of assisting our ally , that we shall entirely take away from France all pretences of hostilities or resentment , since we shall not attack her troops or invade her frontiers , but only furnish the queen of Hungary with money , without directing her how to apply it .
I am far , my lords , from being so much intimidated by the late increase of the French greatness , as to imagine , that no limits can be set to their ambition .
I am far from despairing , that the queen of Hungary alone , supported by us with pecuniary assistance , may be able to reduce them to solicitations for peace by driving them out of her dominions , and pursuing them into their own .
But as the chance of war is always uncertain , it is surely most prudent to choose such a conduct as may exempt us from danger in all events  and since we are not certain of conquering the French , it is , in my opinion , most eligible not to provoke them , because we can not be conquered without ruin .


This method is yet eligible on another account  by proceeding with frugality , we shall gain time to observe the progress of the war , and watch the appearance of any favourable opportunity , without exhausting ourselves so far as to be made unable to improve them .


The time , my lords , at which we shall be thus exhausted , at which we shall be reduced to an absolute inability to raise an army or equip a fleet , is not at a great distance .
If our late profusion be for a short time continued , we shall quickly have drained the last remains of the wealth of our country .
We have long gone on from year to year , raising taxes and contracting debts  and unless the riches of Britain are absolutely unlimited , must in a short time reduce them to nothing .
Our expenses are not all , indeed , equally destructive  some , though the method of raising them be vexatious and oppressive , do not much impoverish the nation , because they are refunded by the extravagance and luxury of those who are retained in the pay of the court  but foreign wars threaten immediate destruction , since the money that is spent in distant countries can never fall back into its former channels , but is dissipated on the continent , and irrecoverably lost .


When this consideration is present to my mind , and , on this occasion , no man who has any regard for himself or his posterity can omit it , I can not but think with horrour on a vote by which such prodigious sums are wafted into another region : I can not but tremble at the sound of a tax for the support of a foreign war , and think a French army landed on our coasts not much more to be dreaded than the annual payment to which we appear now to be condemned , and from which nothing can preserve us but the address which is now proposed .


By what arguments the commons were persuaded , or by what motives incited to vote a supply for the support of this mercenary force , I have not yet heard  nor , as a member of this house , my lords , was it necessary for me to inquire .
Their authority , though mentioned with so much solemnity on this occasion , is to have no influence on our determinations .
If they are mistaken , it is more necessary for us to inquire with uncommon caution .
If they are corrupt , it is more necessary for us to preserve our integrity .
If we are to comply blindly with their decisions , our knowledge and experience are of no benefit to our country , we only waste time in useless solemnities , and may be once more declared useless to the publick .


The commons , my lords , do not imagine themselves , nor are imagined by the nation , to constitute the legislature .
The people , when any uncommon heat prevails in the other house , disturbs their debates , and overrules their determinations , have been long accustomed to expect redress and security from our calmer counsels  and have considered this house as the place where reason and justice may be heard , when , by clamour and uproar , they are driven from the other .
On this occasion , my lords , every Briton fixes his eye upon us , and every man who has sagacity enough to discover the dismal approach of publick poverty , now supplicates your lordships , by agreeing to this address , to preserve him from it .


Then the SPEAKER spoke to the following purport : -- My lords , having very attentively observed the whole progress of this important debate , and considered with the utmost impartiality the arguments which have been made use of on each side , I can not think the question before us doubtful or difficult  and hope that I may promote a speedy decision of it by recapitulating what has been already urged , that the debate may be considered at one view , and by adding some observations which have arisen to my own thoughts on this occasion .


At the first view of the question before us , in its present state , no man can find any reasons for prejudice in favour of the address proposed .
This house is , indeed , yet divided , and many lords have spoken on each side with great force and with great address  but the authority of the other house , added to the numbers which have already declared in this for the support of the foreign troops , is sufficient to turn the balance , in the opinion of any man who contents himself to judge by the first appearance of things  and must incline him to imagine that position at least more probable , which is ratified by the determination of one house , and yet undecided by the other .


I know , my lords , what may be objected to these observations on the other house , and readily agree with the noble lord , that our determinations ought not to be influenced by theirs .
But on this occasion , I introduce their decision not as the decrees of legislators , but as the result of the consideration of wise men  and in this sense it may be no less reasonable to quote the determination of the commons , than to introduce the opinion of any private man whose knowledge or experience give his opinion a claim to our regard .


Nor do I mention the weight of authority on one side as sufficient to influence the private determination of any in this great assembly .
It is the privilege and the duty of every man , who possesses a seat in the highest council of his country , to make use of his own eyes and his own understanding , to reject those arguments of which he can not find the force , whatever effect they may have upon others , and to discharge the great trust conferred upon him by consulting no conscience but his own .


Yet , though we are by no means to suffer the determinations of other men to repress our inquiries , we may certainly make use of them to assist them  we may very properly , therefore , inquire the reasons that induced the other house to approve those bills which are brought before them , since it is not likely that their consent was obtained without arguments , at least probable , though they are not to be by us considered as conclusive upon their authority .
The chief advantage which the publick receives from a legislature formed of several distinct powers , is , that all laws must pass through many deliberations of assemblies independent on each other , of which , if the one be agitated by faction or distracted by divisions , it may be hoped that the other will be calm and united , and of which it can hardly be feared that they can at any time concur in measures apparently destructive to the commonwealth .


But these inquiries , my lords , however proper or necessary , are to be made by us not in solemn assemblies but in our private characters  and therefore I shall not now lay before your lordships what I have heard from those whom I have consulted for the sake of obtaining information on this important question , or shall at least not offer it as the opinion of the commons , or pretend to add to it any influence different from that of reason and truth .


The arguments which have been offered in this debate for the motion , are , indeed , such as do not make any uncommon expedients necessary  they will not drive the advocates for the late measures to seek a refuge in authority instead of reason .
They require , in my opinion , only to be considered with a calm attention , and their force will immediately be at an end .


The most plausible objection , my lords , is , that the measures to which your approbation is now desired , were concerted and executed without the concurrence of the senate  and it is , therefore , urged , that they can not now deserve our approbation , because it was not asked at the proper time .


In order to answer this objection , my lords , it is necessary to consider it more distinctly than those who made it appear to have done , that we may not suffer ourselves to confound questions real and personal , to mistake one object for another , or to be confounded by different views .


That the consent of the senate was not asked , my lords , supposing it a neglect , and a neglect of a criminal kind , of a tendency to weaken our authority , and shake the foundations of our constitution , which is the utmost that the most ardent imagination , or the most hyperbolical rhetorick can utter or suggest , may be , indeed , a just reason for invective against the ministers , but is of no force if urged against the measures .
To take auxiliaries into our pay may be right , though it might be wrong to hire them without applying to the senate  as it is proper to throw water upon a fire , though it was conveyed to the place without the leave of those from whose well it was drawn , or over whose ground it was carried .


If the liberties of Europe be really in danger , if our treaties oblige us to assist the queen of Hungary against the invaders of her dominions , if the ambition of France requires to be repressed , and the powers of Germany to be animated against her by the certain prospect of a vigorous support , I can not discover the propriety of this motion , even supposing that we have not found from the ministers all the respect that we have a right to demand .
As a lawful authority may do wrong , so right may be sometimes done by an unlawful power  and surely , though usurpation ought to be punished , the benefits which have been procured by it , are not to be thrown away .
We may retain the troops that have been hired , if they are useful , though we should censure the ministry for taking them into pay .


But the motion to which our concurrence is now required , is a motion by which we are to punish ourselves for the crime of the ministers , by which we are about to leave ourselves defenceless , because we have been armed without our consent , and to resign up all our rights and privileges to France , because we suspect that they have not been sufficiently regarded on this occasion by our ministers .


Those noble lords who have dwelt with the greatest ardour on this omission , have made no proposition for censuring those whom they condemn as the authors of it , though this objection must terminate in an inquiry into their conduct , and has no real relation to the true question now before us , which is , whether the auxiliaries be of any use ?
If they are useless , they ought to be discharged without any other reason  if they are necessary , they ought to be retained , whatever censure may fall upon the ministry .


I am , indeed , far from thinking , that when your lordships have sufficiently examined the affair , you will think your privileges invaded , or the publick trepanned by artifice into expensive measures  since it will appear that the ministry in reality preferred the most honest to the safest methods of proceeding , and chose rather to hazard themselves , than to practice or appear to practice any fraud upon their country .


When it was resolved in council to take the troops of Hanover into the pay of Britain , a resolution which , as your lordships have already been informed , was made only a few days before the senate rose , it was natural to consider , whether the consent of the senate should not be demanded  but when it appeared upon reflection , that to bring an affair of so great importance before the last remnant of a house of commons , after far the greater part had retired to the care of their own affairs , would be suspected as fraudulent , and might give the nation reason to fear , that such measures were intended as the ministers were afraid of laying before a full senate .
It was thought more proper to defer the application to the next session , and to venture upon the measures that were formed , upon a full conviction of their necessity .


This conduct , my lords , was exactly conformable to the demands of those by whom the court has hitherto been opposed , and who have signalized themselves as the most watchful guardians of liberty .
Among these men , votes of credit have never been mentioned but with detestation , as acts of implicit confidence , by which the riches of the nation are thrown down at the feet of the ministry to be squandered at pleasure .
When it has been urged , that emergencies may arise , during the recess of the senate , which may produce a necessity of expenses , and that , therefore , some credit ought to be given which may enable the crown to provide against accidents , it has been answered , that the expenses which are incurred during the recess of the senate , will be either necessary or not  that if they are necessary , the ministry have no reason to distrust the approbation of the senate , but if they are useless , they ought not to expect it .
And that , instead of desiring to be exempted from any subsequent censures , and to be secured in exactions or prodigality by a previous vote , they ought willingly to administer the publick affairs at their own hazard , and await the judgment of the senate , when the time shall come , in which their proceedings are laid before it .


Such have hitherto been the sentiments of the most zealous advocates for the rights of the people  nor did I expect from any man who desired to appear under that character , that he would censure the ministry for having thrown themselves upon the judgment of the senate , and neglected to secure themselves by any previous applications , for having trusted in their own integrity , and exposed their conduct to an open examination without subterfuges and without precautions .
I did not imagine , my lords , that a senate , upon whose decision all the measures which have been taken , so apparently depend , would have been styled a senate convened only to register the determinations of the ministry  or that any of your lordships would think his privileges diminished , because money was not demanded before the use of it was fully known .
If we lay aside , my lords , all inquiries into precedents , and , without regard to any political considerations , examine this affair only by the light of reason , it will surely appear that the ministry could not , by any other method of proceeding , have shown equal regard to the senate , or equal confidence in their justice and their wisdom .
Had they desired a vote of credit , it might have been justly objected that they required to be trusted with the publick money , without declaring , or being able to declare , how it was to be employed  that either they questioned the wisdom or honesty of the senate  and , therefore , durst undertake nothing till they were secure of the supplies necessary for the execution of it .
Had they informed both houses of their whole scheme , they might have been still charged , and charged with great appearance of justice , with having preferred their own safety to that of the publick , and having rather discovered their designs to the enemy , than trusted to the judgment of the senate  nor could any excuse have been made for a conduct so contrary to all the rules of war , but such as must have dis-honoured either the ministers or the senate , such as must have implied either that the measures intended were unworthy of approbation , or that they were by no means certain , that even the best conduct would not be censured .


These objections they foresaw , and allowed to be valid  and , therefore , generously determined to pursue the end which every man was supposed to approve , by the best means which they could discover , and to refer their conduct to a full senate , in which they did not doubt but their integrity , and , perhaps , their success , would find them vindicators .
Instead of applying , therefore , to the remains of the commons , a few days before the general recess  instead of assembling their friends by private intimations , at a time when most of those from whom they might have dreaded opposition , had retired , they determined to attempt , at their own hazard , whatever they judged necessary for the promotion of the common cause , and to refer their measures to the senate , when it should be again assembled .


The manner in which one of the noble lords , who have spoken in support of the address , has thought it necessary that they should have applied to us , is , indeed , somewhat extraordinary , such as is certainly without precedent , and such as is not very consistent with the constituent rights of the different powers of the legislature .
His lordship has been pleased to remark , that the crown has entered into a treaty , and to ask why that treaty was not previously laid before the senate for its approbation .


I know not , my lords , with what propriety this contract for the troops of Hanover can be termed a treaty .
It is well known that no power in this kingdom can enter into a treaty with a foreign state , except the king  and it is equally certain , that , with regard to Hanover , the same right is limited to the elector .
This treaty , therefore , my lords , is a treaty of the same person with himself , a treaty of which the two counterparts are to receive their ratification from being signed with the same hand .
This , surely , is a treaty of a new kind , such as no national assembly has yet considered .
Had any other power of Britain than its king , or in Hanover any other than the elector , the right of entering into publick engagements , a treaty might have been made  but as the constitution of both nations is formed , the treaty is merely chimerical and absolutely impossible .


Had such a treaty , as is thus vainly imagined , been really made , it would yet be as inconsistent with the fundamental establishment of the empire , to require that before it was ratified it should have been laid before the senate .
To make treaties , as to make war , is the acknowledged and established prerogative of the crown .
When war is declared , the senate is , indeed , to consider whether it ought to be carried on at the expense of the nation  and if treaties require any supplies to put them in execution , they likewise fall properly , at that time , under senatorial cognizance : but to require that treaties shall not be transacted without our previous concurrence , is almost to annihilate the power of the crown , and to expose all our designs to the opposition of our enemies , before they can be completed .


If , therefore , the troops of Hanover can be of use for the performance of our stipulations , if they can contribute to the support of the house of Austria , the ministry can not , in my opinion , be censured for having taken them into British pay  nor can we refuse our concurrence with the commons in providing for their support , unless it shall appear that the design for which all our preparations have been made is such as can not be executed , or such as ought not to be pursued .


Several arguments have been offered to prove both these positions  one noble lord has asserted , that it is by no means for the advantage either of ourselves or any other nation , to restore the house of Austria to its ancient elevation  another , that it is , by the imperial constitutions , unlawful for any of the princes of Germany to make war upon the emperour solemnly acknowledged by the diet .
They have endeavoured to intimidate us , by turning our view to the difficulties by which our attempts are obstructed  difficulties which they affect to represent as insuperable , at least to this nation in its present state .
With this design , my lords , has the greatness of the French power been exaggerated , the faith of the king of Sardinia questioned , and the king of Prussia represented as determined to support the pretensions of the emperour  with this view has our natural strength been depreciated , and all our measures and hopes have been ridiculed , with wantonness , not very consistent with the character of a British patriot .


Most of these arguments , my lords , have been already answered , and answered in such a manner as has , I believe , not failed of convincing every lord of their insufficiency , unless , perhaps , those are to be excepted ty whom they were offered .
It has with great propriety been observed , that the inconsistency imputed to his majesty in opposing the emperour for whom he voted , is merely imaginary  since it is not a necessary consequence , that he for whom he voted is , therefore , lawfully elected  and because his majesty does not engage in this war for the sake of dethroning the emperour , but of supporting the Pragmatick sanction  nor does he oppose him as the head of the German body , but as the invader of the dominions of Austria .


With regard to the propriety of maintaining the Austrian family in its present possessions , and of raising it , if our arms should be prosperous , to its ancient greatness , it has been shown , that no other power is able to defend Europe either against the Turks on one part , or the French on the other  two powers equally professing the destructive intention of extending their dominions without limits , and of trampling upon the privileges and liberties of all the rest of mankind .


It has been shown , that the general scheme of policy uniformly pursued by our ancestors in every period of time , since the increase of the French greatness , has been to preserve an equipoise of power , by which all the smaller states are preserved in security .
It is apparent , that by this scheme alone can the happiness of mankind be preserved , and that no other family but that of Austria is able to balance the house of Bourbon .


This equipoise of power has by some lords been imagined an airy scheme , a pleasing speculation which , however it may amuse the imagination , can never be reduced to practice .
It has been asserted , that the state of nations is always variable , that dominion is every day transferred by ambition or by casualties , that inheritances fall by want of heirs into other hands , and that kingdoms are by one accident divided at one time , and at other times consolidated by a different event  that to be the guardians of all those whose credulity or folly may betray them to concur with the ambition of an artful neighbour , and to promote the oppression of themselves , is an endless task  and that to obviate all the accidents by which provinces may change their masters , is an undertaking to which no human foresight is equal  that we have not a right to hinder the course of succession for our own interest , nor to obstruct those contracts which independent princes are persuaded to make , however contrary to their own interest , or to the general advantage of mankind .
And it has been concluded by those reasoners , that we should show the highest degree of wisdom , and the truest , though not the most refined policy , by attending steadily to our own interest , by improving the dissensions of our neighbours to our own advantage , by extending our commerce , and increasing our riches , without any regard to the happiness or misery , freedom or slavery of the rest of mankind .


I believe I need not very laboriously collect arguments to prove to your lordships that this scheme of selfish negligence , of supine tranquillity , is equally imprudent and ungenerous  since , if we examine the history of the last century , we shall easily discover , that if this nation had not interposed , the French had now been masters of more than half Europe  and it can not be imagined that they would have suffered us to set them at defiance in the midst of their greatness , that they would have spared us out of tenderness , or forborne to attack us out of fear .
What the Spaniards attempted , though unsuccessfully , from a more distant part of the world , in the pride of their American affluence , would certainly have been once more endeavoured by France , with far greater advantages , and as it may be imagined , with a different event .


That it would have been endeavoured , can not be doubted , because the endeavour would not have been hazardous  by once defeating our fleet , they might land their forces , which might be wafted over in a very short time , and by a single victory they might conquer all the island , or that part of it , at least , which is most worth the labour of conquest  and though they should be unsuccessful , they could suffer nothing but the mortification of their pride , and would be in a short time enabled to make a new attempt .


Thus , my lords , if we could preserve our liberty in the general subjection of the western part of the world , we should do it only by turning our island into a garrison , by laying aside all other employment than the study of war , and by making it our only care to watch our coasts : a state which surely ought to be avoided at almost any expense and at any hazard .


To think that we could extend our trade or increase our riches in this state of the continent , is to forget the effects of universal empire .
The French , my lords , would then be in possession of all the trade of those provinces which they had conquered , they would be masters of all their ports and of all their shipping  and your lordships may easily conceive with what security we should venture upon the ocean , in a state of war , when all the harbours of the continent afforded shelter to our enemies .
If the French privateers from a few obscure creeks , unsupported by a fleet of war , or at least not supported by a navy equal to our own , could make such devastations in our trade as enabled their country to hold out against the confederacy of almost all the neighbouring powers  what , my lords , might not be dreaded by us , when every ship upon the ocean should be an enemy  when we should be at once overborne by the wealth and the numbers of our adversaries  when the trade of the world should be in their hands , and their navies no less numerous than their troops .


I have made this digression , my lords , I hope not wholly without necessity , to show that the advantages of preserving the equipoise of Europe are not , as they have been sometimes conceived , empty sounds , or idle notions  but that by the balance of one nation against another , both the safety of other countries and of our own is preserved  and that , therefore , it requires all our vigilance and all our resolution to establish and maintain it .


That there may come a time in which this scheme will be no longer practicable , when a coalition of dominions may be inevitable , and when one power will be necessarily exalted above the rest , is , indeed , not absolutely impossible , and , therefore , not to be peremptorily denied .
But it is not to be inferred , that our care is vain at present , because , perhaps , it may some time be vain hereafter  or that we ought now to sink into slavery without a struggle , because the time may come , when our strongest efforts will be ineffectual .


It has , indeed , been almost asserted , that the fatal hour is now arrived , and that it is to no purpose that we endeavour to raise any farther opposition to the universal monarchy projected by France .
We are told , that the nation is exhausted and dispirited  that we have neither influence , nor riches , nor courage remaining  that we shall be left to stand alone against the united house of Bourbon  that the Austrians can not , and that the Dutch will not , assist us  that the king of Sardinia will desert his alliance  that the king of Prussia has declared against us  and , therefore , that by engaging in the support of the Pragmatick sanction , we are about to draw upon ourselves that ruin which every other power has foreseen and shunned .


I am far from denying , my lords , that the power of France is great and dangerous  but can draw no consequence from that position , but that this force is to be opposed before it is still greater , and this danger to be obviated while it is yet surmountable , and surmountable I still believe it by unanimity and courage .


If our wealth , my lords , is diminished , it is time to confine the commerce of that nation by which we have been driven out of the markets of the continent , by destroying their shipping , and intercepting their merchants .
If our courage is depressed , it is depressed not by any change in the nature of the inhabitants of this island , but by a long course of inglorious compliance with the demands , and of mean submission to the insults , of other nations , to which it is necessary to put an end by vigorous resolutions .


If our allies are timorous and wavering , it is necessary to encourage them by vigorous measures  for as fear , so courage , is produced by example : the bravery of a single man may withhold an army from flight , and other nations will be ashamed to discover any dread of that power which France along sets at defiance .
They will be less afraid to declare their intentions , when they are convinced that we intend to support them  and if there be , in reality , any prince who does not favour our design , he will be at least less inclined to obstruct it , as he finds the opposition , which he must encounter , more formidable .


For this reason , my lords , I am far from discovering the justness of the opinion which has prevailed very much in the nation , on this occasion , that we are not to act without allies , because allies are most easily to be procured by acting , and because it is reasonable and necessary for us to perform our part , however other powers may neglect theirs .


The advice which the senate has often repeated to his majesty , has been to oppose the progress of France  and though it should be allowed , that he has been advised to proceed in concert with his allies , yet it must be understood to suppose such allies as may be found to have courage and honesty enough to concur with him .
It can not be intended , that he should delay his assistance till corruption is reclaimed , or till cowardice is animated  for to promise the queen of Hungary assistance on such terms , would be to insult her calamities , and to withhold our succours till she was irrecoverably ruined .
The senate could not insist that we should stand neuter , till all those , who were engaged by treaty to support the Pragmatick sanction , should appear willing to fulfil their stipulations  for even France is to be numbered among those who have promised to support the house of Austria in its possessions , however she may now endeavour to take them away .


Even with regard to that power from which most assistance may be reasonably expected , nothing would be more imprudent than to declare that we determine not to act without them  for what then would be necessary , but that the French influence one town in their provinces , or one deputy in their assemblies , and ruin the house of Austria in security and at leisure , without any other expense than that of a bribe .


It was , therefore , necessary to transport our troops into Flanders , to show the world that we were no longer inclined to stand idle spectators of the troubles of Europe  that we no longer intended to amuse ourselves , or our confederates , with negotiations which might produce no treaties , or with treaties which might be broken whenever the violation of them afforded any prospect of that advantage  we were now resolved to sacrifice the pleasures of neutrality , and the profits of peaceful traffick , to the security of the liberties of Europe , and the observation of publick faith .


This necessity was so generally allowed , that when the first body of troops was sent over , no objection was made by those who found themselves inclined to censure the conduct of our affairs , but that they were not sufficiently numerous to defend themselves , and would be taken prisoners by a French detachment  the ministry were therefore asked , why they did not send a larger force , why they engaged in hostilities , which could only raise the laughter of our enemies , and why , if they intended war , they did not raise an army sufficient to prosecute it ?


An army , my lords , an army truly formidable , is now raised , and assembled on the frontiers of France , ready to assist our ally , and to put a stop to the violence of invasions .
We now see ourselves once again united with the house of Austria , and may hope once more to drive the oppressors of mankind before us .
But now , my lords , a clamour is propagated through the nation , that these measures , which have been so long desired , are pernicious and treacherous  that we are armed , not against France , but against ourselves  that our armies are sent over either not to fight , or to fight in a quarrel in which we have no concern  to gain victories from which this nation will receive no advantage , or to bring new dishonour upon their country by a shameful inactivity .


This clamour , which if it had been confined to the vulgar , had been , perhaps , of no great importance , nor could have promoted any of the designs of those by whom it was raised , has been mentioned in this house as an argument in favour of the motion which is now under the consideration of your lordships  and it has been urged that these measures can not be proper , because all measures , by which his majesty 's government is made unpopular , must in the end be destructive to the nation .


On this occasion , my lords , it is necessary to consider the nature of popularity , and to inquire how far it is to be considered in the administration of publick affairs .
If by popularity is meant only a sudden shout of applause , obtained by a compliance with the present inclination of the people , however excited , or of whatsoever tendency , I shall without scruple declare , that popularity is to be despised  it is to be despised , my lords , because it can not be preserved without abandoning much more valuable considerations .
The inclinations of the people have , in all ages , been too variable for regard .
But if by popularity be meant that settled confidence and lasting esteem , which a good government may justly claim from the subject , I am far from denying that it is truly desirable  and that no wise man ever disregarded it .
But this popularity , my lords , is very consistent with contempt of riotous clamours , and of mistaken complaints  and is often only to be obtained by an opposition , to the reigning opinions , and a neglect of temporary discontents  opinions which may be inculcated without difficulty by favourite orators , and discontents which the eloquence of seditious writers may easily produce on ignorance and inconstancy .


How easily the opinions of the vulgar may be regulated by those who have obtained , by whatever methods , their esteem , the debate of this day , my lords , may inform us  since , if the measures against which this motion is intended , be really unpopular , as they have been represented , it is evident that there has been lately a very remarkable change in the sentiments of the nation  for it is yet a very little time since the repression of the insolence of France , and the relief of the queen of Hungary was so generally wished , and so importunately demanded , that had measures like these been then formed , it is not improbable that they might have reconciled the publick to that man whom the united voice of the nation has long laboured to overbear .


It is , indeed , urged with a degree of confidence , which ought , in my opinion , to proceed from stronger proof than has yet been produced , that no hostilities are intended  that our armaments on the continent are an idle show , an inoffensive ostentation , and that the troops of Hanover have been hired only to enrich the electorate , under the appearance of assisting the queen of Hungary , whom in reality they can not succour without drawing upon their country the imperial interdict .


It has been alleged , my lords,-that these measures have been concerted wholly/or the advantage of Hanover  that this kingdom is to be sacrificed to the electorate , and that we are in reality intended to be made tributaries to a petty power .


In confirmation of these suggestions , advantage has been taken from every circumstance that could admit of misrepresentation .
The constitution of the empire has been falsely quoted , to prove that they can not act against the emperour , and their inactivity in Flanders has been produced as a proof , that they do not intend to enter Germany .


Whoever shall consult the constituent and fundamental pact by which the German form of government is established , will find , my lords , that it is not in the power of the emperour alone to lay any of the states of Germany under the ban  and that the electors are independent in their own dominions , so far as that they may enter into alliances with foreign powers , and make war upon each other .


It appears , therefore , my lords , that no law prohibits the elector of Hanover to send his troops to the assistance of the queen of Hungary  he may , in consequence of treaties , march into Germany , and attack the confederates of the emperour , or what is not now intended , even the emperour himself , without any dread of the severities of the ban .


Nor does the continuance of the forces in Flanders show any unwillingness to begin hostilities , or any dread of the power of either Prussia , whose prohibition is merely imaginary , or of France , who is not less perplexed by the neighbourhood of our army than by any other method that could have been taken of attacking her  for being obliged to have an equal force always in readiness to observe their motions , she has not been able to send a new army against the Austrians , but has been obliged to leave the emperour at their mercy , and suffer them to recover Bohemia without bloodshed , and establish themselves at leisure in Bavaria .


Nor is this , my lords , the only advantage which has been gained by their residence in Flanders  for the United Provinces have been animated to a concurrence in the common cause , and have consented so far to depart from their darling neutrality , as to send twenty thousand of their forces to garrison the barrier .
Of which no man , I suppose , will say that it is not of great importance to the queen of Hungary , since it sets her free from the necessity of distracting her views , and dividing her forces for the defence of the most distant parts of her dominions at once  nor will it be affirmed , that this advantage could have probably been gained , without convincing our allies of our sincerity , by sending an army into the continent .


If it be asked , what is farther to be expected from these troops ?
it ought to be remembered , my lords , with how little propriety our ministers can be required to make publick a scheme of hostile operations , and how much we should expose ourselves to our enemies , should a precedent be established by which our generals would be incapacitated to form any private designs , and an end would be for ever put to military secrecy .


What necessity there can be for proposing arguments like these , I am not , indeed , able to discover , since the objections which have been made seem to proceed rather from obstinacy than conviction  and the reflections that have been vented seem rather the product of wit irritated by malevolence , than of reason enlightened by calm consideration .
The ministers have been reproached with Hanoverian measures , without any proof that Hanover is to receive the least advantage  and have been charged with betraying their country by those who can not show how their country is injured , nor can prove either that interest or faith would allow us to sit inactive in the present disturbance of Europe , or that we could have acted in any other manner with equal efficacy .


It is so far from being either evident or true , my lords , that Britain is sacrificed to Hanover , that Hanover is evidently hazarded by her union with Britain .
Had this electorate now any other sovereign than the king of Great Britain , it might have been secure by a neutrality , and have looked upon the miseries of the neighbouring provinces without any diminution of its people , or disturbance of its tranquillity  nor could any danger be dreaded , or any inconvenience be felt , but from an open declaration in favour of the Pragmatick sanction .


Why the hire of the troops of any particular country should be considered as an act of submission to it , or of dependency upon it , I can not discover  nor can I conceive for what reason the troops of Hanover should be more dangerous , or less popular , at this than at any former time , or why the employment of them should be considered as any particular regard .
If any addition of dominion had been to be purchased for the electorate by the united arms of the confederate army , I should , perhaps , be inclined to censure the scheme , as contrary to the interest of my native country  nor shall any lord more warmly oppose designs that may tend to aggrandize another nation at the expense of this .
But to hire foreigners , of whatever country , only to save the blood of Britons , is , in my opinion , an instance of preference which ought to produce rather acknowledgments of gratitude than sallies of indignation .


Upon the most exact survey of this debate , I will boldly affirm , that I never heard in this house a question so untenable in itself , so obstinately or so warmly debated  but hope that the sophistries which have been used , however artful , and the declamations which have been pronounced , however pathetick , will have no effect upon your lordships .
I hope , that as the other house has already agreed to support the auxiliaries which have been retained , and which have been proved in this debate to be retained for the strongest reasons , and the most important purposes , your lordships will show , by rejecting this motion , that you are not less willing to concur in the support of publick faith , and that you will not suffer posterity to charge you with the exaltation of France , and the ruin of Europe .


[ The question was then put , and determined in the negative , by 90 against 35 . ]


After the conclusion of this long debate , the ministry did not yet think their victory in repelling this censure sufficiently apparent , unless a motion was admitted , which might imply a full and unlimited approbation of their measures  and therefore the earl of SCARBOROUGH rose , and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , it has been justly observed in the debate of this day , that the opinions of the people of Britain are regulated in a great measure by the determinations of this house  that they consider this as the place where truth and reason obtain a candid audience  as a place sacred to justice and to honour  into which , passion , partiality , and faction have been very rarely known to intrude  and that they , therefore , watch our decisions as the great rules of policy , and standing maxims of right , and readily believe these measures necessary in which we concur , and that conduct unblameable which has gained our approbation .


This reputation , my lords , we ought diligently to preserve , by an unwearied vigilance for the happiness of our fellow-subjects  and while we possess it , we ought likewise to employ its influence to beneficial purposes , that the cause and the effect may reciprocally produce each other  that the people , when the prosperity which they enjoy by our care , inclines them to repose in us an implicit confidence , may find that confidence a new source of felicity  that they may reverence us , because they are secure and happy  and be secure and happy , because they reverence us .


This great end , my lords , it will not be very difficult to attain  the foundation of this exalted authority may easily be laid , and the superstructure raised in a short time  the one may be laid too deep to be undermined , and the other built too firmly to be shaken  at least they can be impaired only by ourselves , and may set all external violence at defiance .


To preserve the confidence of the people , and , consequently , to govern them without force , and without opposition , it is only necessary that we never willingly deceive them  that we expose the publick affairs to their view , so far as they ought to be made publick in their true state  that we never suffer false reports to circulate under the sanction of our authority , nor give the nation reason to think we are satisfied , when we are , in reality , suspicious of illegal designs , or that we suspect those measures of latent mischiefs with which we are , in reality , completely satisfied .


But it is not sufficient , my lords , that we publish ourselves no fallacious representations of our counsels  it is necessary , likewise , that we do not permit them to be published , that we obviate every falsehood in its rise , and propagate truth with our utmost diligence .
For if we suffer the nation to be deceived , we are not much less criminal than those who deceive it  at least we must be confessed no longer to act as the guardians of the publick happiness , if we suffer it to be interrupted by the dispersion of reports which we know to be at once false and pernicious .


Of these principles , which I suppose will not be contested , an easy application may be made to the business of the present day .
A question has been debated with great address , great ardour , and great obstinacy , which is in itself , though not doubtful , yet very much diffused  complicated with a great number of circumstances , and extended to a multitude of relations  and is , therefore , a subject upon which sophistry may very safely practise her arts , and which may be shown in very different views to those whose intellectual light is too much contracted to receive the whole object at once .
It may easily be asserted , by those who have long been accustomed to affirm , without scruple , whatever they desire to obtain belief , that the arguments in favour of the motion , which has now been rejected by your lordships , were unanswerable  and it will be no hard task to lay before their audience such reasons as , though they have been easily confuted by the penetration and experience of your lordships , may , to men unacquainted with politicks , and remote from the sources of intelligence , appear very formidable .


It is , therefore , not sufficient that your lordships have rejected the former motion , and shown that you do not absolutely disapprove the measures of the government , since it may be asserted , and with some appearance of reason , that barely not to admit a motion by which all the measures of the last year would have been at once over-turned and annihilated , is no proof that they have been fully justified , and warmly confirmed , since many of the transactions might have been at least doubtful , and yet this motion not have been proper .


In an affair of so great importance , my lords , an affair in which the interest of all the western world is engaged , it is necessary to take away all suspicions , when the nation is about to be involved in a war for the security of ourselves and our posterity  in a war which , however prosperous , must be at least expensive , and which is to be carried on against an enemy who , though not invincible , is , in a very high degree , powerful .
It is surely proper to show , in the most publick manner , our conviction , that neither prudence nor frugality has been wanting  that the inconveniencies which will be always felt in such contentions , are not brought upon us by wantonness or negligence  and that no care is omitted by which they are alleviated , and that they may be borne more patiently , because they can not be avoided .


This attestation , my lords , we can only give by a solemn address to his majesty of a tendency contrary to that of the motion now rejected  and by such an attestation only can we hope to revive the courage of the nation , to unite those in the common cause of liberty whom false reports have alienated or shaken , and to restore to his majesty that confidence which all the subtilties of faction have been employed to impair .
I , therefore , move , that an humble address be presented to his majesty , importing , `` That in the unsettled and dangerous situation of affairs in Europe , the sending a considerable body of British forces into the Austrian Netherlands , and augmenting the same with sixteen thousand of his majesty 's electoral troops , and the Hessians in the British pay , and thereby , in conjunction with the queen of Hungary 's troops in the Low Countries , forming a great army for the service of the common cause , was a wise , useful , and necessary measure , manifestly tending to the support and encouragement of his majesty 's allies , and the real and effectual assistance of the queen of Hungary , and the restoring and maintaining the balance of power , and has already produced very advantageous consequences . ''


The earl of OXFORD spoke next , to the following effect : -- My lords , the necessity of supporting our reputation , and of preserving the confidence of the publick , I am by no means inclined to dispute , being convinced , that from the instant in which we shall lose the credit which our ancestors have delivered down to us , we shall be no longer considered as a part of the legislature , but be treated by the people only as an assembly of hirelings and dependants , convened at the pleasure of the court to ratify its decisions without examination , to extort taxes , promote slavery , and to share with the ministry the crime and the infamy of cruelty and oppression .


For this reason , it is undoubtedly proper , that we avoid not only the crime , but the appearance of dependence  and that every doubtful question should be freely debated , and every pernicious position publickly condemned  and that when our decisions are not agreeable to the opinion or expectations of the people , we should at least show them that they are not the effects of blind compliance with the demands of the ministry , or of an implicit resignation to the direction of a party .
We ought to show , that we are unprejudiced , and ready to hear truth  that our determinations are not dictated by any foreign influence , and that it will not be vain to inform us , or useless to petition us .


In these principles I agree with the noble lord who has made the motion  but in the consequences which are on this occasion to be drawn from them , I can not but differ very widely from him  for , in my opinion , nothing can so much impair our reputation , as an address like that which is proposed  an address not founded either upon facts or arguments , and from which the nation can collect only , that the protection of this house is withdrawn from them , that they are given up to ruin , and that they are to perish as a sacrifice to the interest of Hanover .


Let us consider what we are now invited to assert , and it will easily appear how well this motion is calculated to preserve and to advance the reputation of this house .
We are to assert , my lords , the propriety of a new war against the most formidable power of the universe , at a time when we have been defeated and disgraced in our conquests with a kingdom of inferiour force .
We are to declare our readiness to pay and to raise new taxes , since no war can be carried on without them , at a time when our commerce , the great source of riches , is obstructed  when the interest of debts contracted during a long war , and a peace almost equally expensive , is preying upon our estates  when the profits of the trade of future ages , and the rents of the inheritances of our latest descendants , are mortgaged  and what ought yet more to affect us , at a time when the outcry of distress is universal , when the miseries of hopeless poverty have sunk the nation into despair , when industry scarcely retains spirit sufficient to continue her labours , and all the lower ranks of mankind are overwhelmed with the general calamity .


There may , perhaps , be some among your lordships who may think this representation of the state of the publick exaggerated beyond the truth .
There are many in this house who see no other scenes than the magnificence of feasts , the gaieties of balls , and the splendour of a court  and it is not much to be wondered at , if they do not easily believe what it is often their interest to doubt , that this luxury is supported by the distress of millions , and that this magnificence exposes multitudes to nakedness and famine .
It is my custom , when the business of the senate is over , to retire to my estate in the country , where I live without noise , and without riot , and take a calm and deliberate survey of the condition of those that inhabit the towns and villages about me .
I mingle in their conversation , and hear their complaints  I enter their houses , and find by their condition that their complaints are just  I discover that they are daily impoverished , and that they are not able to struggle under the enormous burdens of publick payments , of which I am convinced that they can not be levied another year without exhausting the people , and spreading universal beggary over the nation .


What can be the opinion of the publick , when they see an address of this house , by which new expenses are recommended ?
Will they not think that their state is desperate , and that they are sold to slavery , from which nothing but insurrections and bloodshed can release them ?
If they retain any hopes of relief from this house , they must soon be extinguished , when they find in the next clause , that we are sunk to such a degree of servility , as to acknowledge benefits which were never received , and to praise the invisible service of our army in Flanders .


If it be necessary , my lords , to impose upon the publick , let us at least endeavour to do it less grossly  let us not attempt to persuade them that those forces have gained victories who have never seen an enemy , or that we are benefited by the transportation of our money into another country .
If it be necessary to censure those noble lords who have supported the former motion , and to punish them for daring to use arguments which could not be confuted  for this is the apparent tendency of the present motion  let us not lose all consideration of ourselves , nor sacrifice the honour of the house to the resentment of the ministry .


For my part , my lords , I shall continue to avow my opinion in defiance of censures , motions and addresses  and as I struggled against the former ministry , not because I envied or hated them , but because I disapproved their conduct  I shall continue to oppose measures equally destructive with equal zeal , by whomsoever they are projected , or by whomsoever patronised .


Lord CARTERET spoke next , to the following purpose : -- My lords , after so full a defence of the former motion as the late debate has produced , it is rather with indignation than surprise , that I hear that which is now offered .
It has been for a long time the practice of those who are supported only by their numbers , to treat their opponents with contempt , and when they can not answer to insult them  and motions have been made , not because they were thought right by those who offered them , but because they would certainly be carried , and would , by being carried , mortify their opponents .


This , my lords , is the only intent of the present motion which can promote no useful purpose , and which , though it may flatter the court , must be considered by the people as an insult  and therefore , though I believe all opposition fruitless , I declare that I never will agree to it .


And to show , my lords , that I do not oppose the ministry for the sake of obstructing the publick counsels , or of irritating those whom I despair to defeat  and that I am not afraid of trusting my conduct to the impartial examination of posterity , I shall beg leave to enter , with my protest , the reasons which have influenced me in this day 's deliberation , that they be considered when this question shall no longer be a point of interest , and our present jealousies and animosities are forgotten .


[ It was carried in the affirmative , by 78 against 35 . ]


HOUSE OF LORDS , FEBRUARY 21 , 1742-3 .


DEBATE ON SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS .


The bill for altering the duties on spirituous liquors , and permitting them again to be sold with less restraint , which was sent up by the commons to the house of lords , produced there very long and serious deliberations , to which the lords had every day each a particular summons , as in cases of the highest concern .


The bill was entitled , An act for repealing certain duties on spirituous liquors , and on licenses for retailing the same , and for laying other duties on spirituous liquors , and on licenses for retailing the said liquors .


The duties which were proposed to be repealed , were those laid by the act 9 Geo .
II .
which permitted no person to sell spirituous liquors in less quantity than two gallons without a license , for which fifty pounds were to be paid .
Whereas by the new bill a small duty per gallon was laid on at the still-head , and the license was to cost but twenty shillings , which was to be granted only to such as had licenses for selling ale .
On the credit of this act , as soon as it was passed by the commons , the ministry borrowed a large sum at three per cent , but it was understood that the sinking fund was pledged as a collateral security to pay any deficiency .


In about a fortnight this bill passed all the forms in the house of commons , almost without opposition  and with little or no alteration from the scheme brought into the committee on ways and means for raising the supply for the current year , by Mr. SANDYS , then chancellor of the exchequer .


It was immediately carried up to the house of lords , where it was read for the first time on the 17th of February  and ordered a second reading on the twenty-second .
On that day the commissioners of excise , according to an order of the house , brought an account of the sums arising by the last act , and a yearly account for several years past  and attending were interrogated concerning the execution of the last act .


The bishop of ORFORD particularly inquired , whether it had been effectually put in force , and questions of the same kind were asked by lord LONSDALE and others  to which the commissioners answered , that it had been diligently and vigorously executed , so far as they or their officers had power to enforce it  but that the justices had not always been equally zealous in seconding their endeavours  and that it was impossible to discover all the petty dealers by whom it was infringed , spirituous liquors still continuing to be sold in small obscure shops , and at the corners of the streets .


A motion was also made , that three of the physicians of most note for their learning and experience , should be summoned to attend the house , to declare their opinion with regard to the effects of spirituous liquors upon the human body .
But this was rejected by 33 against 17 .


The bill was read the second time on the day appointed , when the question being put , whether it should be committed , lord HERVEY rose , and spoke to the following effect : --


My lords , though I doubt not but the bill now before us will be promoted in this house , by the same influence by which it has been conducted through the other  yet I hope its success will be very different , and that those arts by which its consequences , however formidable , have been hitherto concealed , or by which those whose business it was to have detected and exposed them , have been induced to turn their eyes aside , will not be practised here with the same efficacy , though they should happen to be attempted with the same confidence .
I hope that zeal for the promotion of virtue , and that regard to publick happiness , which has on all occasions distinguished this illustrious assembly , will operate now with uncommon energy , and prevent the approbation of a bill , by which vice is to be made legal , by which the fences of subordination are to be thrown down , and all the order of society , and decency of regular establishments be obliterated by universal licentiousness , and lost in the wild confusions of debauchery  of debauchery encouraged by law , and promoted for the support of measures expensive , ridiculous , and unnecessary .


A law of so pernicious a tendency shall , at least , not pass through this house without opposition  nor shall drunkenness be established among us without the endeavour of one voice , at least , to withhold its progress  for I now declare that I oppose the commitment of this bill , and that I am determined to continue my opposition to it in all the steps by which the forms of our house make it necessary that it should pass before it can become a law .


Nor do I speak , my lords , on this occasion , with that distrust and mental hesitation which are both natural and decent , when questions are dubious , when probability seems to be almost equally divided , when truth appears to hover between two parties , and by turns to favour every speaker  when specious arguments are urged on both sides , and the number of circumstances to be collected , and of relations to be adjusted , is so great , that an exact and indubitable decision is scarcely to be attained by human reason .
I do not , my lords , now speak with the diffidence of inquiry , or the uncertainty of conjecture , nor imagine that I am now examining a political expedient , of which the success can only be perfectly known by experience , and of which , therefore , no man can absolutely determine , whether it will be useful or pernicious , or a metaphysical difficulty , which may be discussed for ever without being decided .


In considering this bill , my lords , I proceed upon stated and invariable principles .
I have no facts to examine but such as , to the last degree , are notorious , such as have been experienced every hour , since the existence of society  and shall appeal , not to transitory opinions , or casual assertions , but to the laws of all civilized nations , and to the determinations of every man whose wisdom or virtue have given him a claim to regard .


All the decrees of all the legislators of the earth , or the declarations of wise men , all the observations which nature furnishes , and all the examples which history affords , concur in condemning this bill before us , as a bill injurious to society , destructive of private virtue , and , by consequence , of publick happiness , detrimental to the human species , and , therefore , such as ought to be rejected in that assembly to which the care of the nation is committed  that assembly which ought to meet only for the benefit of mankind , and of which the resolutions ought to have no other end , than the suppression of those vices by which the happiness of life is obstructed or impaired .


The bill now before you , my lords , is fundamentally wrong , as it is formed upon a hateful project of increasing the consumption of spirituous liquors , and , consequently , of promoting drunkenness among a people reproached already for it throughout the whole world .
It contains such a concatenation of enormities , teems with so vast a number of mischiefs , and therefore produces , in those minds that attend to its nature , and pursue its consequences , such endless variety of arguments against it , that the memory is perplexed , the imagination crowded , and utterance overburdened .
Before any one of its pernicious effects is fully dilated a thousand others appear  the hydra still shoots out new heads , and every head vomits out new poison to infect society , and lay the nation desolate .


I am , therefore , at a loss , my lords , not how to raise arguments against this bill , which can not be read or mentioned without , furnishing them by thousands  but how to methodise those that occur to me , and under what heads to range my thoughts , that I may pursue my design without confusion , that I may understand myself , and be understood by your lordships .


A multitude of considerations are obvious , all of importance sufficient to claim attention , and to outweigh the advantages proposed by this hateful bill , but which can not all be mentioned , or at least not with that exactness which they deserve  I shall , therefore , confine myself at present to three considerations , and shall entreat the attention of your lordships , while I examine the bill now before us , with regard to its influence on the health and morals of the people , the arguments by which it has been hitherto supported , and the effects which it will have on the sinking fund .


The first head , my lords , is so copious , that I find myself very little relieved by the division which I have made .
The moral arguments , though separated from those which are either political or temporary , are sufficient to overpower the strongest reason , and overflow the most extensive comprehension .


It is not necessary , I suppose , to show that health of body is a blessing , that the duties of life in which the greatest part of the world is employed , require vigour and activity , and that to want strength of limbs , and to want the necessary supports of nature , are to the lower classes of mankind the same .
I need not observe to your lordships , whose legislative character obliges you to consider the general concatenation of society , that all the advantages which high stations or large possessions can confer , are derived from the labours of the poor  that to the plough and the anvil , the loom and the quarry , pride is indebted for its magnificence , luxury for its dainties , and delicacy for its ease .
A very little consideration will be sufficient to show , that the lowest orders of mankind supply commerce with manufacturers , navigation with mariners , and war with soldiers  that they constitute the strength and riches of every nation  and that , though they generally move only by superiour direction , they are the immediate support of the community  and that without their concurrence , policy would project in vain , wisdom would end in idle speculation , and the determinations of this assembly would be empty sounds .


It is , therefore , my lords , of the utmost importance , that all practices should be suppressed by which the lower orders of the people are enfeebled and enervated  for if they should be no longer able to bear fatigues or hardships , if any epidemical weakness of body should be diffused among them , our power must be at an end , our mines would be an useless treasure , and would no longer afford us either the weapons of war , or the ornaments of domestick elegance  we should no longer give law to mankind by our naval power , nor send out armies to fight for the liberty of distant nations  we should no longer supply the markets of the continent with our commodities , or share in all the advantages which nature has bestowed upon distant countries , for all these , my lords , are the effects of indigent industry , and mechanick labour .


All these blessings or conveniencies are procured by that strength of body , which nature has bestowed upon the natives of this country , who have hitherto been remarkably robust and hardy , able to support long fatigues , and to contend with the inclemency of rigorous climates , the violence of storms , and the turbulence of waves , and who have , therefore , extended their conquests with uncommon success , and been equally adapted to the toils of trade and of war , and have excelled those who endeavoured to rival them either in the praise of workmanship or of valour .


But , my lords , if the use of spirituous liquors be encouraged , their diligence , which can only be supported by health , will quickly languish  every day will diminish the numbers of the manufacturers , and , by consequence , augment the price of labour  those who continue to follow their employments , will be partly enervated by corruption , and partly made wanton by the plenty which the advancement of their wages will afford them , and partly by the knowledge that no degree of negligence will deprive them of that employment in which there will be none to succeed them .
All our commodities , therefore , will be wrought with less care and at a higher price , and therefore , will be rejected at foreign markets in favour of those which other nations will exhibit of more value , and yet at a lower rate .


No sooner , my lords , will this bill make drunkenness unexpensive and commodious , no sooner will shops be opened in every corner of the streets , in every petty village , and in every obscure cellar for the retail of these liquors , than the workrooms will be forsaken , when the artificer has , by the labour of a small part of the day , procured what will be sufficient to intoxicate him for the remaining hours  for he will hold it ridiculous to waste any part of his life in superfluous diligence , and will readily assign to merriment and frolicks that time which he now spends in useful occupations .


But such is the quality of these liquors , that he will not long be able to divide his life between labour and debauchery , he will soon find himself disabled by his excesses from the prosecution of his work , and those shops which were before abandoned for the sake of pleasure , will soon be made desolate by sickness  those who were before idle , will become diseased , and either perish by untimely deaths , or languish in misery and want , an useless burden to the publick .


Nor , my lords , will the nation only suffer by the deduction of such numbers from useful employments , but by the addition of great multitudes to those who must be supported by the charity of the publick .
The manufacturer , who by the use of spirituous liquors weakens his limbs or destroys his health , at once , takes from the community to which he belongs , a member by which the common stock was increased , and by leaving a helpless family behind him , increases the burden which the common stock must necessarily support .
And the trader or husbandman is obliged to pay more towards the maintenance of the poor , by the same accident which diminishes his trade or his harvest , which takes away part of the assistance which he received , and raises the price of the rest .


That these liquors , my lords , liquors of which the strength is heightened by distillation , have a natural tendency to inflame the blood , to consume the vital juices , destroy the force of the vessels , contract the nerves , and weaken the sinews , that they not only disorder the mind for a time , but by a frequent use precipitate old age , exasperate diseases , and multiply and increase all the infirmities to which the body of man is liable , is generally known to all whose regard to their own health , or study to preserve that of others , has at any time engaged them in such inquiries , and would have been more clearly explained to your lordships , had the learned physicians been suffered to have given their opinions on this subject , as was yesterday proposed .


Why that proposal was rejected , my lords  for what reason , in the discussion of so important a question , any kind of evidence was refused , posterity will find it difficult to explain , without imputing to your lordships such motives as , I hope , will never operate in this assembly .
It will be , perhaps , thought that the danger was generally known , though not acknowledged  and that those who resolved to pass the bill , had no other care than to obstruct such information as might prove to mankind , that they were incited by other designs than that of promoting the publick good .


It is not , however , necessary that any very curious inquiries should be made for the discovery of that which , indeed , can not be concealed , and which every man has an opportunity of remarking that passes through the streets .


So publick , so enormous , and so pernicious has been this dreadful method of debauchery , that it has excited and baffled the diligence of the magistrates , who have endeavoured to stop its progress or hinder its effects .
They found their efforts ineffectual , and their diligence not only not useful to the publick , but dangerous to themselves .
They quickly experienced , my lords , the folly of those laws which punish crimes instead of preventing them  they found that legal authority had little influence , when opposed to the madness of multitudes intoxicated with spirits , and that the voice of justice was but very little heard amidst the clamours of riot and drunkenness .


We live , my lords , in a nation where the effects of strong liquors have been for a long time too well known  we know that they produce , in almost every one , a high opinion of his own merit  that they blow the latent sparks of pride into flame , and , therefore , destroy all voluntary submission  they put an end to subordination , and raise every man to an equality with his master , or his governour .
They repress all that awe by which men are restrained within the limits of their proper spheres , and incite every man to press upon him that stands before him , that stands in the place of which that sudden elevation of heart , which drunkenness bestows , makes him think himself more worthy .


Pride , my lords , is the parent , and intrepidity the fosterer of resentment  for this reason , men are almost always inclined , in their debauches , to quarrels and to bloodshed  they think more highly of their own merit , and , therefore , more readily conclude themselves injured  they are wholly divested of fear , insensible of present danger , superiour to all authority , and , therefore , thoughtless of future punishment  and what then can hinder them from expressing their resentment with the most offensive freedom , or pursuing their revenge with the most daring violence .


Thus , my lords , are forgotten disputes often revived , and after having been long reconciled , are at last terminated by blows  thus are lives destroyed upon the most trifling occasions , upon provocations often imaginary , upon chimerical points of honour , where he who gave the offence , perhaps without design , supports it only because he has given it  and he who resents it , pursues his resentment only because he will not acknowledge his mistake .


Thus are lives lost , my lords , at a time when those who set them to hazard , are without consciousness of their value , without sense of the laws which they violate , and without regard to any motives but the immediate influence of rage and malice .


When we consider , my lords , these effects of drunkenness , it can be no subject of wonder , that the magistrate finds himself overborne by a multitude united against him , and united by general debauchery .
Government , my lords , subsists upon reverence , and what reverence can be paid to the laws , by a crowd , of which every man is exalted by the enchantment of those intoxicating spirits , to the independence of a monarch , the wisdom of a legislator , and the intrepidity of a hero ?
when every man thinks those laws oppressive that oppose the execution of his present intentions , and considers every magistrate as his persecutor and enemy ?


Laws , my lords , suppose reason  for who ever attempted to restrain beasts but by force  and , therefore , those that propose the promotion of publick happiness , which can be produced only by an exact conformity to good laws , ought to endeavour to preserve what may properly be called the publick reason  they ought to prevent a general depravation of the faculties of those whose benefit is intended , and whose obedience is required  they ought to take care that the laws may be known , for how else can they be observed ?
and how can they be known , or at least , how can they be remembered in the heats of drunkenness ?


That the laws are universally neglected and defied among the lower class of mankind , among those whose want of the lights of knowledge and instruction , makes positive and compulsory directions more necessary for the regulation of their conduct , is apparent from the representation of the magistrates , in which the general disorders of this great city , the open wickedness , the daring insolence , and unbounded licentiousness of the common people , is very justly described .


Their wickedness and insolence , my lords , is , indeed , such , that order is almost at an end , rank no longer confers respect , nor does dignity afford security .
The same confidence produces insults and robberies , and that insensibility with which debauchery arms the mind equally against fear and pity , frequently aggravates the guilt of robbery with greater crimes  those who are so unhappy as to fall into the hands of thieves , heated by spirits into madmen , seldom escape without suffering greater cruelties than the loss of money .


That the use of these poisonous draughts quickly debilitates the limbs , and destroys the strength of the body  however this quality may impair our manufactures , weaken our armies , and diminish our commerce  however it may reduce our fleets to an empty show , and enable our enemies to triumph in the field , or our rivals to supplant us in the market , can scarcely , my lords , come under consideration , when we reflect how debauchery operates upon the morals .


It is happy , my lords , that those who are inclined to mischief , are disabled in a short time from executing their intentions , by the same causes which excite them  that they are obliged to stop in the career of their crimes , that they are preserved from the hand of the executioner by the liquor which exposes them to it , and that palsies either disable them from pursuing their villanies , or fevers put an end to their lives .


It is happy , my lords , that what is thus violent , can not be lasting  that those lives which are employed in mischief , are generally short  and that since it is the quality of this malignant liquor to corrupt the mind , it likewise destroys the body .


But this effect , my lords , is not constant or regular  men sometimes continue for many years , to supply the , expenses of drunkenness by rapine , and to exasperate the fury of rapine by drunkenness .
And , therefore , though there could be any one so regardless of the happiness of mankind , as to look without concern upon them who hurry themselves to the grave with poison , he may yet be incited by his own interest to prevent the progress of this practice , a practice which tends to the subversion of all order , and the destruction of all happiness .


It is well known , my lords , that publick happiness must be on a stated proportion to publick virtue  that mutual trust is the cement of society , and that no man can be trusted but as he is reputed honest .
To promote trust , my lords , is the apparent tendency of all laws .
When the ties of morality are enforced by penal sanctions , men are more afraid to violate them , and , therefore , are trusted with less danger  but when they no longer fear the law , they are to be restrained only by their consciences  and if neither law nor conscience has any influence upon their conduct , they are only a herd of wild beasts , let loose to prey upon each other , and every man will inflict or suffer pain , as he meets with one stronger or weaker than himself .
Thus , my lords , will all authority cease , property will become dangerous to him that possesses it , and confusion will overspread the whole community  nor can it be easily conceived , by the most extensive comprehension how far the mischiefs may spread , or where the chain of destructive consequences will end .


If we consider our fleet or our army , my lords , it is apparent , that neither obedience nor fidelity can be expected from men upon whom all the ties of morality , and all the sanctions of law have lost their influence  they will mutiny without fear , and desert without scruple , and like wild beasts , will , upon the least provocation , turn upon those by whom they ought to be governed .


But drunkenness , my lords , not only corrupts men , by taking away the sense of those restraints by which they are generally kept in awe , and withheld from the perpetration of villanies , but by superadding the temptations of poverty , temptations not easily to be resisted , even by those whose eyes are open to the consequences of their actions , and which , therefore , will certainly prevail over those whose apprehensions are laid asleep , and who never extend their views beyond the gratification of the present moment .


Drunkenness , my lords , is the parent of idleness  for no man can apply himself to the business of his trade , either while he is drinking , or when he is drunk .
Part of his time is spent in jollity , and part in imbecility  when he is amidst his companions he is too gay to think of the consequences of neglecting his employment  and when he has overburdened himself with liquor , he is too feeble and too stupid to follow it .


Poverty , my lords , is the offspring of idleness , as idleness of drunkenness  the drunkard 's work is little and his expenses are great  and , therefore , he must soon see his family distressed , and his substance reduced to nothing : and surely , my lords , it needs not much sagacity to discover what will be the consequence of poverty produced by vice .


It is not to be expected , my lords , that a man thus corrupted will be warned by the approach of misery , that he will recollect his understanding , and awaken his attention  that he will apply himself to his business with new diligence , endeavour to recover , by an increase of application , what he has lost by inattention , and make the remembrance of his former vices , and the difficulties and diseases which they brought upon him , an incitement to his industry , a confirmation of his resolution , and a support to his virtue .


That this is , indeed , possible , I do not intend to deny  but the bare possibility of an event so desirable , is the utmost that can be admitted  for it can scarcely be expected , that any man should be able to break through all the obstacles that will obstruct his return to honesty and wisdom  his companions will endeavour to continue the infatuating amusements which have so long deluded him  his appetite will assist their solicitations  the desire of present ease by which all mankind are sometimes led aside from virtue , will operate with unusual strength  since , to retrieve his misconduct , he must not only deny himself the pleasure which he has so long indulged , but must bear the full view of his distress from which he will naturally turn aside his eyes .
The general difficulty of reformation will incline him to seek for ease by any other means , and to delay that amendment which he knows to be necessary , from hour to hour , and from day to day , till his resolutions are too much weakened to prove of any effect , and his habits confirmed beyond opposition .


At length , necessity , immediate necessity , presses upon him  his family is made clamorous by want , and his calls of nature and of luxury are equally importunate  he has now lost his credit in the world , and none will employ him , because none will trust him , or employment can not immediately be , perhaps , obtained  because his place has for a long time been supplied by others .
And , even if he could obtain a readmission to his former business , his wants are now too great and too pressing to be supplied by the slow methods of regular industry  he must repair his losses by more efficacious expedients , and must find some methods of acquisition , by which the importunity of his creditors may be satisfied .


Industry is now , by long habits of idleness , become almost impracticable  his attention having been long amused by pleasing objects , and dissipated by jollity and merriment , is not readily recalled to a task which is unpleasing , because it is enjoined  and his limbs , enervated by hot and strong liquors , liquors of the most pernicious kind , can not support the fatigues necessary in the practice of his trade  what was once wholesome exercise is now insupportable fatigue  and he has not now time to habituate himself , by degrees , to that application which he has intermitted , that labour which he has disused , or those arts which he has forgotten .


In this state , my lords , he easily persuades himself that his condition is desperate , that no legal methods will relieve him  and that , therefore , he has nothing to hope but from the efforts of despair .
These thoughts are quickly confirmed by his companions , whom the same misconduct has reduced to the same distress , and who have already tried the pleasures of being supported by the labour of others .
They do not fail to explain to him the possibility of sudden affluence , and , at worst , to celebrate the satisfaction of short-lived merriment .
He , therefore , engages with them in their nocturnal expeditions , an association of wickedness is formed , and that man , who before he tasted this infatuating liquor , contributed every day , by honest labour , to the happiness or convenience of life , who supported his family in decent plenty , and was himself at ease , becomes at once miserable and wicked  is detested as a nuisance by the community , and hunted by the officers of justice  nor has mankind any thing now to wish or hope with regard to him , but that by his speedy destruction , the security of the roads may be restored , and the tranquillity of the night be set free from the alarms of robbery and murder .


These , my lords , are the consequences which necessarily ensue from the use of those pernicious , those infatuating spirits , which have justly alarmed every man whom pleasure or sloth has not wholly engrossed , and who has ever looked upon the various scenes of life with that attention which their importance demands .


Among these , my lords , the clergy have distinguished themselves by a zealous opposition to this growing evil , and have warned their hearers with the warmest concern against the misery and wickedness which must always be the attendants or the followers of drunkenness .

, whose merit has raised him to a seat in this august , assembly , and whose instructions are enforced by the sanctity of his life , has , in a very cogent and pathetical manner , displayed the enormity of this detestable sin , the universality of its prevalence , and the malignity of its effects  and in his discourse on the infirmary of this city , has observed with too much justness , that the lowest of the people are infected with this vice , and that even necessity is become luxurious .


Many other authorities [ Footnote : He read the preamble to a former bill , the opinion of the college of physicians . ]
might be produced , and some others I have now in my hand  but the recital of them would waste the day to no purpose : for surely it is not necessary to show , by a long deduction of authorities , the guilt of drunkenness , or to prove that it weakens the body , or that it depraves the mind , that it makes mankind too feeble for labour , too indolent for application , too stupid for ingenuity , and too daring for the peace of society .


This , surely , my lords , is , therefore , a vice which ought , with the utmost care , to be discouraged by those whose birth or station has conferred upon them the province of watching over the publick happiness  and which , surely , no prospect of present advantage , no arguments of political convenience , will prevail upon this house to promote .


That the natural and evident tendency of this bill is the propagation of drunkenness , can not be denied , when it is considered that it will increase the temptations to it by making that liquor , which is the favourite of the common people , more common , by multiplying the places at which it is sold , so that none can want an opportunity of yielding to any sudden impulse of his appetite , which will solicit him more powerfully and more incessantly as they are more frequently and more easily gratified .


In defence of a bill like this , my lords , it might be expected , that at least many specious arguments should be offered .
It may be justly hoped that no man will rise up in opposition to all laws of heaven and earth , to the wisdom of all legislators , and the experience of every human being , without having formed such a train of arguments as will not easily be disconcerted , or having formed at least such a chain of sophistry as can not be broken but with difficulty .


And yet , my lords , when I consider what has been offered by all who have hitherto appeared either in publick assemblies , or in private conversation , as advocates for this bill , I can scarcely believe , that they perceive themselves any force in their own arguments  and am inclined to conclude , that they speak only to avoid the imputation of being able to say nothing in defence of their own scheme  that their hope is not to convince by their reasons , but to overpower by their numbers  that they are themselves influenced , not by reason , but by necessity  and that they only encourage luxury , because money is to be raised for the execution of their schemes : and they imagine , that the people will pay more cheerfully for liberty to indulge their appetites , than for any other enjoyment .


The arguments which have been offered , my lords , in vindication of this bill , or at least which I have hitherto heard , are only two , and those two so unhappily associated , that they destroy each other  whatever shall be urged to enforce the second , must in the same proportion invalidate the first  and whoever shall assert , that the first is true , must admit that the second is false .


These positions , my lords , the unlucky positions which are laid down by the defenders of this pernicious bill , are , that it will supply the necessities of the government with a very large standing revenue , on the credit of which , strengthened by the additional security of the sinking fund , a sum will be advanced sufficient to support the expenses of a foreign war  and that at the same time it will lessen the consumption of the liquors from whence this duty is to arise .


By what arts of political ratiocination these propositions are to be reconciled , I am not able to discover .
It appears evident , my lords , that large revenues can only be raised by the sale of large quantities  and that larger quantities will in reality be sold , as the price is little or nothing raised , and the venders are greatly increased .


If this will not be the effect , my lords , and if this effect is not expected , why is this bill proposed as sufficient to raise the immense sums which our present exigencies require ?
Can duties be paid without consumption of the commodity on which they are laid ?
and is there any other use of spirituous liquors than that of drinking them ?


Surely , my lords , it is not expected , that any arguments should be admitted in this house without examination  and yet it might be justly imagined , that this assertion could only be offered in full confidence of an implicit reception , and this tenet be proposed only to those who had resigned their understandings to the dictates of the ministry  for it is implied in this position , that the plenty of a commodity diminishes the demand for it  and that the more freely it is sold , the less it will be bought .
It implies , that men will lay voluntary restraints upon themselves , in proportion as they are indulged by their governours  and that all prohibitory laws tend to the promotion of the practices which they condemn  it implies , that a stop can only be put to fornication by increasing the number of prostitutes , and that theft is only to be restrained by leaving your doors open .


I am , for my part , convinced , that drunkards , as well as thieves , are made by opportunity  and that no man will deny himself what he desires , merely because it is allowed him by the laws of his country .


This , my lords , is so evident , that I shall no longer dwell upon the assertion , that the unbounded liberty of retailing spirits will make spirits less used in the nation  but shall examine the second argument , and consider how far it is possible or proper to raise supplies by a tax upon drunkenness .


That large sums will be raised by the bill to which the consent of your lordships is now required , I can readily admit , because the consumption of spirits will certainly be greater , and the licenses taken for retailing them so numerous , that a much lower duty than is proposed will amount yearly to a very large sum  for if the felicity of drunkenness can be more cheaply obtained by buying spirits than ale , when both are to be found at the same place , it is easy to see which will be preferred  this argument , therefore , is irrefragable , and may be urged in favour of the bill without danger of confutation .


But , my lords , it is the business of governours not so much to drain the purses , as to regulate the morals of the people  not only to raise taxes , but to levy them in such a manner as may be least burdensome , and to apply them to purposes which may be most useful  not to raise money by corrupting the nation , that it may be spent in enslaving it .


It has been mentioned by a very celebrated writer , as a rational practice in the exercise of government , to tax such commodities as were abused to the increase of vice , that vice may be discouraged by being made more expensive  and therefore the community in time be set free from it : but the tax which is now proposed , my lords , is of a different kind  it is a tax laid upon vice , indeed , but it is to arise from the licenses granted to wickedness , and its consequences must be the increase of debauchery , not the restraint .
It is a tax which will be readily paid , because it will be little felt  and because it will be little felt , it is hoped that multitudes will subject themselves to it .


The act which is now to be repealed , was , indeed , of a very different nature , though perhaps not free from very just objections .
It had this advantage at least , that so far as it was put in execution , it obstructed drunkenness  nor has the examination of the officers of excise discovered any imperfection in the law  for it has only failed , because it was timorously or negligently executed .
Why it was not vigorously and diligently enforced , I have never yet been able to discover .
If the magistrates were threatened by the populace , the necessity of such laws was more plainly proved  for what justifies the severity of coercion but the prevalence of the crime ?
and what may not be feared from crowds intoxicated with spirits , whose insolence and fury is already such , that they dare to threaten the government by which they are debarred from the use of them ?


This , my lords , is a reflection that ought not to be passed slightly over .
The nature of our constitution , happy as it is , must be acknowledged to produce this inconvenience , that it inclines the common people to turbulence and sedition  the nature of spirituous liquors is such , that they inflame these dispositions , already too much predominant  and yet the turbulence of the people is made a reason for licensing drunkenness , and allowing , without limitation , the sale of those spirits by which that turbulence must be certainly increased .


It may be , perhaps , urged , ( for indeed I know not what else can be decently alleged , ) that there is a necessity of raising money , that no other method can be invented , and that , therefore , this ought not to be opposed .


I know , my lords , that ministers generally consider , as the test of each man 's loyalty , the readiness with which he concurs with them in their schemes for raising money  and that they think all opposition to these schemes , which are calculated for the support of the government , the effect of a criminal disaffection  that they always think it a sufficient vindication of any law , that it will bring in very large sums  and that they think no measures pernicious , nor laws dangerous , by which the revenue is not impaired .


If government was instituted only to raise money , these ministerial schemes of policy would be without exception  nor could it be denied , that the present ministers show themselves , by this expedient , uncommon masters of their profession .
But the end of government is only to promote virtue , of which happiness is the consequence  and , therefore , to support government by propagating vice , is to support it by means which destroy the end for which it was originally established , and for which its continuance is to be desired .


If money , therefore , can not be raised but by this bill , if the expenses of the government can not be defrayed but by corrupting the morals of the people , I shall without scruple declare , that money ought not to be raised , nor the designs of the government supported , because the people can suffer nothing from the failure of publick measures , or even from the dissolution of the government itself , which will be equally to be dreaded or avoided with an universal depravity of morals , and a general decay of corporeal vigour .
Even the insolence of a foreign conqueror can inflict nothing more severe than the diseases which debauchery produces  nor can any thing be feared from the disorders of anarchy more dangerous or more calamitous , than the madness of sedition , or the miseries which must ensue to each individual from universal wickedness .


Such , my lords , is the expedient by which we are now about to raise the supplies for the present year  and such is the new method of taxation which the sagacity of our ministers has luckily discovered .
A foreign war is to be supported by the destruction of our people at home , and the revenue of the government to be improved by the decay of our manufactures .
We are to owe henceforward our power to epidemical diseases , our wealth to the declension of our commerce , and our security to riot and to tumult .


There is yet another consideration , my lords , which ought well to be regarded , before we suffer this bill to pass .
Many laws are merely experimental , and have been made , not because the legislature thought them indisputably proper , but because no better could at that time be struck out , and because the arguments in their favour appeared stronger than those against them , or because the questions to which they related were so dark and intricate that nothing was to be determined with certainty , and no other method could therefore be followed , but that of making the first attempts at hazard , and correcting these errours , or supplying these defects which might hereafter be discovered by those lights which time should afford .


Though I am far from thinking , my lords , that the question relating to the effects of this law is either doubtful or obscure  though I am certain that the means of reforming the vice which its advocates pretend it is designed to prevent , are obvious and easy  yet I should have hoped , that the projectors of such a scheme would have allowed at least the uncertainty of the salutary effects expected from it , and would , therefore , have made some provision for the repeal of it when it should be found to fail .


But , my lords , our ministers appear to have thought it sufficient to endear them to their country , and immortalize their names , that they have invented a new method of raising money , and seem to have very little regard to any part of the art of government  they will , at least in their own opinion , have deserved applause , if they leave the publick revenue greater , by whatever diminution of the publick virtue .


They have , therefore , my lords , wisely contrived a necessity of continuing this law , whatever may be its consequences , and how fatal soever its abuses  for they not only mortgage the duties upon spirits for the present supply , but substitute them in the place of another security given to the bank by the pot act  and , therefore , since it will not be easy to form another tax of equal produce , we can have very little hope that this will be remitted .


There will be , indeed , only one method of setting the nation free from the calamities which this law will bring upon it  and as I doubt not but that method will at last be followed , it will certainly deserve the attention of your lordships , as the third consideration to which , in our debates on this bill , particular regard ought to be paid .


That the license of drunkenness , and the unlimited consumption of spirituous liquors , will fill the whole kingdom with idleness , diseases , riots , and confusion , can not be doubted  nor can it be questioned , but that in a very short time the senate will be crowded with petitions from all the trading bodies in the kingdom , for the regulation of the workmen and servants , for the extinction of turbulence and riot , and for the removal of irresistible temptations to idleness and fraud .
These representations may be for a time neglected , but must soon or late be heard  the ministers will be obliged to repeal this law , for the same reason that induced them to propose it .
Idleness and sickness will impair our manufactures , and the diminution of our trade will lessen the revenue .


They will then , my lords , find that their scheme , with whatever prospects of profit it may now flatter them , was formed with no extensive views  and that it was only the expedient of political avarice , which sacrificed a greater distant advantage to the immediate satisfaction of present gain .
They will find , that they have corrupted the people without obtaining any advantage by their crime , and that they must have recourse to some new contrivance by which their own errours may be retrieved .


In this distress , my lords , they can only do what indeed they now seem to design  they can only repeal this act by charging the debt , which it has enabled them to contract , upon the sinking fund , upon that sacred deposit which was for a time supposed unalienable , and from which arose all the hopes that were sometimes formed by the nation , of being delivered from that load of imposts , which it can not much longer support .
They can only give security for this new debt , by disabling us for ever from paying the former .


The bill now before us , my lords , will , therefore , be equally pernicious in its immediate and remoter consequences  it will first corrupt the people , and destroy our trade , and afterwards intercept that fund which is appropriated to the most useful and desirable of all political purposes , the gradual alleviation of the publick debt .


I hope , my lords , that a bill of this portentous kind , a bill big with innumerable mischiefs , and without one beneficial tendency , will be rejected by this house , without the form of commitment  that it will not be the subject of a debate amongst us , whether we shall consent to poison the nation  and that instead of inquiring , whether the measures which are now pursued by the ministry ought to be supported at the expense of virtue , tranquillity , and trade , we should examine , whether they are not such as ought to be opposed for their own sake , even without the consideration of the immense sums which they apparently demand .


I am , indeed , of opinion , that the success of the present schemes will not be of any benefit to the nation , and believe , likewise , that there is very little prospect of success .
I am , at least , convinced , that no advantage can countervail the mischiefs of this detestable bill  which , therefore , I shall steadily oppose , though I have already dwelt upon this subject perhaps too long  yet as I speak only from an unprejudiced regard to the publick , I hope , if any new arguments shall be attempted , that I shall be allowed the liberty of making a reply .


Lord BATHURST replied to the following purport : -- My lords , I doubt not but the noble lord has delivered , on this occasion , his real sentiments , and that , in his opinion , the happiness of our country , the regard which ought always to be paid to the promotion of virtue , require that this bill should be rejected .
I am far from suspecting , that such an appearance of zeal can conceal any private views , or that such pathetick exclamations can proceed but from a mind really affected with honest anxiety .


This anxiety , my lords , I shall endeavour to dissipate before it has been communicated to others  for I think it no less the duty of every man who approves the publick measures , to vindicate them from misrepresentation , than of him to whom they appear pernicious or dangerous , to warn his fellow-subjects of that danger .


I , my lords , am one of those who are convinced that the bill now before us , which has been censured as fundamentally wrong , is in reality fundamentally right  that the end which is proposed by it is just , and the means which are prescribed in it will accomplish the purpose for which they were contrived .


The end of this bill , my lords , is to diminish the consumption of distilled spirits , to restrain the populace of these kingdoms from a liquor which , when used in excess , has a malignity to the last degree dangerous , which at once inebriates and poisons , impairs the force of the understanding , and destroys the vigour of the body  and to attain this , I think it absolutely right to lay a tax upon these liquors .


Of the vice of drunkenness , my lords , no man has a stronger abhorrence than myself  of the pernicious consequences of these liquors , which are now chiefly used by the common people , no man is more fully convinced , and therefore , none can more zealously wish that drunkenness may be suppressed , and distilled spirits withheld from the people .


The disorders mentioned by the noble lord , are undoubtedly the consequences of the present use of these liquors , but these are not its worst effects .
The offenders against the law , may by the law be sometimes reclaimed , and at other times cutoff  nor can these practices , however injurious to particular persons , in any great degree impair the general happiness .
The worst effects , therefore , of the use of spirits , are that idleness and extravagance which it has introduced among the common people , by which our commerce must be obstructed , and our present riches and plenty every day diminished .


This pernicious practice , my lords , is disseminated farther than could be reasonably believed by those whose interest has not incited , or curiosity induced them to inquire into the practice of the different classes of men .
It is well known , that the farmers have been hitherto distinguished by the virtues of frugality , temperance , and industry  that they laboured hard , and spent little  and were , therefore , justly considered as an innocent and useful part of the community , whose employment and parsimony preserved them in a great measure from the general infection of vice which spread its influence among the traders and men of estates .


But even this abstemious class of men , my lords , have of late relaxed their frugality , and suffered themselves to be tempted by this infatuating liquor  nor is any thing now more common than to find it in those houses in which ale , a few years ago , was the highest pitch of luxury to which they aspired , and to see those hours wasted in intoxicating entertainments , which were formerly dedicated wholly to the care of their farms , and the improvement of their fortunes .


Thus , my lords , it appears , that the corruption is become universal , and , therefore , that some remedy ought to be attempted  nor can I conceive any measures more consistent with justice , or more likely to produce the end intended by them , than those which are now offered to your consideration , by which the liquor will be made dearer , too dear to be lavishly drank by those who are in most danger of using it to excess  and the number of those who retail it will be diminished by the necessity of taking a license , and of renewing them every year at the same expense .


The inefficacy , my lords , of violent methods , and the impossibility of a total deprivation of any enjoyment which the people have by custom made familiar and dear to them , sufficiently appears from the event of the law which is now to be repealed .
It is well known , that by that law the use of spirituous liquors was prohibited to the common people  that retailers were deterred from vending them by the utmost encouragement that could be given to informers  and that discoveries were incited by every art that could be practised , and offenders punished with the utmost rigour .


Yet what was the effect , my lords , of all this diligence and vigour ?
A general panick suppressed , for a few weeks , the practice of selling the prohibited liquors  but , in a very short time , necessity forced some , who had nothing to lose , to return to their former trade  these were suffered sometimes to escape , because nothing was to be gained by informing against them , and others were encouraged by their example to imitate them , though with more secrecy and caution  of those , indeed , many were punished , but many more escaped , and such as were fined often found the profit greater than the loss .


The prospect of raising money by detecting their practices , incited many to turn information into a trade  and the facility with which the crime was to be proved , encouraged some to gratify their malice by perjury , and others their avarice  so that the multitude of informations became a publick grievance , and the magistrates themselves complained that the law was not to be executed .


The perjuries of informers were now so flagrant and common , that the people thought all informations malicious  or , at least , thinking themselves oppressed by the law , they looked upon every man that promoted its execution , as their enemy  and , therefore , now began to declare war against informers , many of whom they treated with great cruelty , and some they murdered in the streets .


By their obstinacy they at last wearied the magistrates , and by their violence they intimidated those who might be inclined to make discoveries  so that the law , however just might be the intention with which it was enacted , or however seasonable the methods prescribed by it , has been now for some years totally disused  nor has any one been punished for the violation of it , because no man has dared to offer informations .
Even the vigilance of the magistrates has been obliged to connive at these offences , nor has any man been found willing to engage in a task , at once odious and endless , or to punish offences which every day multiplied , and of which the whole body of the common people , a body very formidable when united , was universally engaged .


The practice , therefore , of vending and of drinking distilled spirits , has prevailed for some time without opposition  nor can any man enter a tavern or an alehouse , in which they will be denied him , or walk along the streets without being incited to drink them at every corner  they have been sold for several years , with no less openness and security than any other commodity  and whoever walks in this great city , will find his way very frequently obstructed by those who are selling these pernicious liquors to the greedy populace , or by those who have drank them till they are unable to move .


But the strongest proof of the inefficacy of the late law , and consequently of the necessity of another , which may not be so easily eluded or so violently resisted , is given by the papers which lie upon the table .
From these it appears that the quantity of spirits distilled has increased from year to year to the present time  and , therefore , that drunkenness is become more prevalent , and the reasons for repressing it more urgent than ever before .


Let us , therefore , calmly consider , my lords , what can in this exigence be done  that the people should be allowed to poison themselves and their posterity without restraint , is certainly not the intent of any good man  and therefore we are now to consider how it may be prevented .
That the people are infected with the vice of drunkenness , that they debauch themselves chiefly with spirituous liquors , and that those liquors are in a high degree pernicious , is confessed both by those who oppose the bill , and those who defend it  but with this advantage on the part of those that defend it , that they only propose a probable method of reforming the abuses which they deplore .
I know that the warm resentment which some lords have on former occasions expressed against the disorders which distilled liquors are supposed to produce , may naturally incline them to wish that they were totally prohibited , and that this liquid fire , as it has been termed , were to be extinguished for ever .


Whether such wishes are not more ardent than rational  whether their zeal against the abuse of things , indifferent in themselves , has not , as has often happened in other cases , hurried them into an indiscreet censure of the lawful use , I shall not now inquire  because it is superfluous to dispute about the propriety of measures , of which the possibility may be justly questioned .


This last act , my lords , was of this kind  the duties established by it were so high that they wholly debarred the lower classes of the , people from the liquor on which they were laid  and , therefore , it was found by a very short experience , that it was impossible to preserve it from violation  that there would be no end of punishing those who offended against it  and that severity produced rather compassion than terrour .
Those who have suffered the penalties were considered as persons under unjust persecution , whom every one was obliged by the ties of humanity to encourage , reward , and protect  and those who informed against them , or encouraged informations , were detested , as the oppressors of the people .
The law had , indeed , this effect , that it debarred , at least for a short time , all those from retailing spirits who lived in reputation  and , therefore , encouraged others to vend them in private places , where they were more likely to be drank to excess .


Having , therefore , made trial of violent and severe methods , and had an opportunity of obtaining a full conviction of their inefficacy , it is surely proper to profit by our experience , by that experience which shows us that the use of distilled liquors , under its present discouragements , has every year increased  and , therefore , proves at once the unprofitableness of the law now in force , and the necessity of some other by which the same purposes may be more certainly promoted .


The reformation of a vice so prevalent must be slow and gradual  for it is not to be hoped , that the whole bulk of the people will at once be divested of their habits  and , therefore , it will be rational to endeavour , not wholly to debar them from any thing in which , however absurdly , they place their happiness , but to make the attainment of it more and more difficult , that they may insensibly remit their ardour , and cease from their pursuit .


This , my lords , is proposed in the present bill , which , by the duties which are to be laid upon distilled spirits , will raise the price a third part , and as it is reasonable to expect , hinder a third part of the consumption  for it is observed , that those who drink them set no limits to their excesses , but indulge their appetites to the utmost of their power  if he , therefore , who used to spend threepence a-day in spirits , can now have no more than could formerly be bought for twopence , he must necessarily content himself with only two thirds of the quantity which he has hitherto drank  and , therefore , must by force , though , perhaps , not by inclination , be less intemperate .


It is not to be doubted , my lords , but that spirits will , by this additional duty , be made one third part dearer  for it has been hitherto observed , that retailers levy upon the buyer twice the duty that is paid to the government , as is every day apparent in other commodities  so that the yearly quantity of spirits which is usually distilled will cost five hundred thousand pounds more than before , a tax which , I suppose , those who are charged with this kind of debauchery will not be supposed able to pay , and which yet must be paid by them , unless they will be content with a less quantity .


That spirits will now be sold in every publick-house , of whatever denomination , has been , I believe , justly asserted  but the assertion has not been properly urged as an argument against the bill .
One of the circumstances which has contributed to the enormous abuse of these liquors , has been the practice of retailing them in obscure places , by persons without character and without money  who , therefore , neither feared penalties nor infamy , and offended against law and decency with equal security .
But when the cheapness of licenses shall make it convenient for every man that pleases to retail spirits in a publick manner , they will be generally drank in houses visited by publick officers , observed by the neighbouring inhabitants , and frequented by persons of morals and civility , who will always endeavour to restrain all enormous excesses , and oblige the masters of the houses to pay some regard to the laws .
Those whose appetites are too importunate to be restrained , may now gratify them without being tempted to enter into houses of infamy , or mingling with beggars , or thieves , or ` profligates  and , therefore , though the use of spirits should continue the same , its consequences will be less fatal , since they may be had without the necessity of associating with wickedness .


But , my lords , it is not improbable , that by this bill the number of retailers , at least in this city , where they are most pernicious , may be lessened .
It is well known , that the reason for which they are sold in cellars , and in the streets , is the danger of retailing them in other places  and that if they were generally sold by those who could procure the best of each sort , these petty traders would be immediately undone  for it is reasonable to imagine , my lords , that they buy the cheapest liquors , and sell them at the dearest rate .


When , therefore , reputable houses shall be opened for the sale of these liquors , decency will restrain some , and prudence will hinder others from endangering their health by purchasing those liquors which are offered in the street , and from hazarding their morals , or perhaps their lives , by drinking to excess in obscure places .


It is likewise to be remembered , my lords , that many of those who now poison their countrymen with petty shops of debauchery , are not able to purchase a license , even at the cheap rate at which it is now proposed , and that therefore they will be restrained from their trade by a legal inability  for it is not , my lords , to be imagined , that they will be defended with equal zeal by the populace , when the liquors may be had without their assistance , nor will information be equally infamous , when it is not the act only of profligates , who pursue the practice of it as a trade , but of the proper officers of every place , incited by the lawful venders of the same commodities , or of the venders themselves , who will now be numerous enough to protect each other , and whom their common interest will incite against clandestine dealers .


The price of licenses , therefore , appears to me very happily adjusted : had it been greater there would not have been a sufficient number of lawful retailers to put a stop to clandestine sellers  and if it was lower , every petty dealer in this commodity might , by pretending to keep an alehouse , continue the practice of affording an harbour to thieves , and of propagating debauchery .


Thus , my lords , it appears to me that the bill will lessen the consumption of these destructive spirits , certainly in a great degree , by raising the price , and probably by transferring the trade of selling them into more reputable hands .
What more can be done by human care or industry I do not conceive .
To prohibit the use of them is impossible , to raise the price of them to the same height with that of foreign spirits , is , indeed , practicable , but surely at this time no eligible method  for so general is this kind of debauchery , that no degree of expense would entirely suppress it  and as foreign spirits , if they were to be sold at the same price , would always be preferred to our own , we should only send into other nations that money which now circulates among ourselves , and impoverish the people without reforming them .


The regulation provided by the bill before us is , therefore , in my opinion , the most likely method for recovering the ancient industry and sobriety of the common people  and , my lords , I shall approve it , till experience has shown it to be defective .
I shall approve it , not with a view of obtaining or securing the favour of any of those who may be thought to interest themselves in its success , but because I find some new law for this purpose indispensably necessary , and believe that no better can be contrived .
We are now , my lords , to contend with the passions of all the common people .
We are endeavouring to reform a vice almost universal  a vice which , however destructive , is now no longer reproachful .
We have tried the force of violent methods and found them unsuccessful  we are now , therefore , to treat the vulgar as children , with a kind of artful indulgence , and to take from them secretly , and by degrees , what can not be wholly denied them , without exasperating them almost to rebellion .
This is the first attempt , and by this , if one third of the consumption be diminished , we may next year double the duty , and , by a new augmentation of the price , take away another third , and what will then be drank , will , perhaps , by the strictest moralists , be allowed to be rather beneficial than hurtful .
By this gradual procedure , we shall give those , who have accustomed themselves to this liquor , time to reclaim their appetites , and those that live by distilling , opportunities of engaging in some other employment  we shall remove the distemper of the publick , without any painful remedies , and shall reform the people insensibly , without exasperating or persecuting them .


The bishop of OXFORD spoke to the following purport : -- My lords , as I am not yet convinced of the expedience of the bill now before us , nor can discover any reason for believing that the advantages will countervail the mischiefs which it will produce , I think it my duty to declare , that I shall oppose it , as destructive to virtue , and contrary to the inviolable rules of religion .


It appears to me , my lords , that the liberty of selling liquors , which are allowed to be equally injurious to health and virtue , will by this law become general and boundless  and I can discover no reason for doubting that the purchasers will be multiplied by increasing the numbers of the venders , and the increase of the sale of distilled spirits , and the propagation of all kinds of wickedness are the same  I must conclude that bill to be destructive to the publick by which the sale of spirits will be increased .


It has been urged that other more vigorous methods have been tried , and that they are now to be laid aside , because experience has shown them to be ineffectual , because the people unanimously asserted the privilege of debauchery , opposed the execution of justice , and pursued those with the utmost malice that offered informations .


I should think , my lords , that government approaching to its dissolution , that was reduced to submit its decrees to their judgment who are chiefly accused of the abuse of these liquors  for surely , when the lowest , the most corrupt part of the people , have obtained such a degree of influence as to dictate to the legislature those laws by which they expect to be governed , all subordination is at an end .


This , my lords , I hope I shall never see the state of my own country : I hope I shall never see the government without authority to enforce obedience to the laws , nor have I , indeed , seen any such weakness on this occasion : the opposition that was made , and the discontent that was excited , were no greater than might be reasonably expected , when the vice which was to be reformed was so enormously predominant  nor was the effect of the law less than any one who foresaw such opposition might reasonably have conceived .


In this city alone there were , before the commencement of that law , fifteen hundred large shops , in which no other trade was carried on than that of retailing these pernicious liquors  in which no temptation to debauchery was forgotten  and , what can not be mentioned without horrour , back rooms and secret places were contrived for receptacles of those who had drank till they had lost their reason and their limbs  there they were crowded together till they recovered strength sufficient to go away or drink more .


These pestilential shops , these storehouses of mischief , will , upon the encouragement which this law will give them , be set open again  new invitations will be hung out to catch the eyes of passengers , who will again be enticed with promises of being made drunk for a penny , and that universal debauchery and astonishing licentiousness which gave occasion to the former act will return upon us .


It is to little purpose , my lords , that the licenses for selling distilled spirits are to be granted only to those who profess to keep houses for the sale of other liquors , since nothing will be more easy than to elude this part of the law .
Whoever is inclined to open a shop for the retail of spirits , may take a license for selling ale  and the sale of one barrel of more innocent liquors in a year will entitle to dispense poison with impunity , and to contribute without control to the corruption of mankind .


It is confessed , that since this law was made , these liquors , have been sold only at corners of the streets in petty shops , and in private cellars  and , therefore , it must be allowed , that if the consumption has increased , it , has , at least , increased less than if the free and open sale had been permitted  for the necessity of secrecy is always a restraint , and every restraint must in some degree obstruct any practice , since those that follow it under restraint would pursue it more vigorously , if that restraint were taken away  and those that are now totally hindered , would , at least , be more strongly tempted by greater liberty  and where the temptation is more powerful , more will probably be overcome by it .


But , my lords , however the law may in this crowded city have been eluded and defied , however drunkenness may here have been protected by the insolence which it produces , and crimes have been sheltered by the multitudes of offenders , I am informed , that in parts less populous , the efficacy of the late act never was denied  and that it has in many parts rescued the people from the miseries of debauchery , and only failed in others by the negligence of those to whom the execution of it was committed .


Negligently and faintly as it was executed , it did in effect hinder many from pursuing this destructive kind of trade  and even in the metropolis itself , almost a total stop was for a time put to the use of spirits  and had the magistrates performed their duty with steadiness and resolution , it is probable , that no plea would have arisen in favour of this bill from the inefficacy of the last .


I can not , indeed , deny , that the multitude of false informers furnished the magistrates with a very specious pretence for relaxing their vigilance  but it was only , my lords , a specious pretence , not a warrantable reason  for the same diligence should have been used to punish false informers as clandestine retailers  the traders in poison and in perjury should have been both pursued with incessant vigour , the sword of justice should have been drawn against them , nor should it have been laid aside , till either species of wickedness had been exterminated .


In the execution of this , as of other penal laws , my lords , it will be always possible for the judge to be misled by false testimonies  and , therefore , the argument which false informations furnish may be used against every other law , where information is encouraged .
Yet , my lords , it has been long the practice of this nation to incite criminals to detect each other  and when any enormous crime is committed , to proclaim at once pardon and rewards to him that shall discover his accomplices .
This , my lords , is an apparent temptation to perjury  and yet no inconvenieucies have arisen from it , that can reasonably induce us to lay it aside .


Perjury may in the execution of this law be detected by the same means as on other occasions  and whenever it is detected , ought to be rigorously punished  and I doubt not but in a short time the difficulties and inconveniencies which are asserted in the preamble of this bill to have attended the putting the late act in execution , would speedily have vanished  the number of delinquents would have been every day lessened , and the virtue and industry of the nation would have been restored .


It is not , indeed , asserted , that the execution of the late act was impossible , but that it was attended with difficulties  and when , my lords , was any design of great importance effected without difficulties ?
It is difficult , without doubt , to restrain a nation from vice  and to reform a nation already corrupted , is still more difficult .
But as both , however difficult , are necessary , it is the duty of government to endeavour them , till it shall appear that no endeavours can succeed .


For my part , my lords , I am not easily persuaded to believe that remissness will succeed , where assiduity has failed  and , therefore , if it be true , as is supposed in the preamble , that the former act was ineffectual by any defects in itself , I can not conceive that this will operate with greater force .
I can not imagine that appetites will be weakened by lessening the danger of gratifying them , or that men who will break down the fences of the law to possess themselves of what long habits have , in their opinion , made necessary to them , will neglect it , merely because it is laid in their way .


With regard to this act , my lords , it is to be inquired , whether it is likely to be executed with more diligence than the former , and whether the same obstacles may not equally obstruct the execution of both .


The great difficulty of the former method , a method certainly in itself reasonable and efficacious , arose from the necessity of receiving informations from the meanest and most profligate of the people , who were often tempted to lay hold of the opportunities which that law put into their hands , of relieving their wants , or gratifying their resentment  and very frequently intimidated the innocent by threats of accusations , which were not easily to be confuted .
They were , therefore , equally dangerous to those that obeyed the act , and to those that disregarded it  for they sometimes put their threats in execution , and raised prosecutions against those who had committed no other crime than that of refusing to bribe them to silence .


An abuse so notorious , my lords , produced a general detestation of all informers , or , at least , concurred with other causes to produce it  and that detestation became so prevalent in the minds of the populace , that at last it became to the highest degree dangerous to attempt the conviction of those , who , in the most open and contemptuous manner , every day violated the laws of their country  and in time the retailers trusting to the protection of the people , laid aside all cautions , at least in this great city , and prosecuted their former practice with the utmost security .


This , my lords , was the chief difficulty and inconvenience hitherto discovered in the law which is now to be repealed .
Thus was its execution obstructed , and the provisions enacted by it made ineffectual .
This defect , therefore , ought to be chiefly regarded in any new regulations .
But what securities , my lords , are provided against the same evil in the bill before us ?
Or why should we imagine that this law will be executed with less opposition than the last ?
The informers will undoubtedly be of the same class as before  they are still to be incited by a reward  and , therefore , it may be reasonably feared , that they will act upon the same motives , and be persecuted with the same fury .


To obviate this inconvenience appears to me very easy , by converting the duty upon licenses to a large duty upon the liquors to be paid by the distiller  the payment of which will be carefully exacted by proper officers , who , though their employment is not very reputable , pursue it at least without any personal danger  and who inform their superiours of any attempts to defraud the revenue , without being censured as officious or revengeful , and , therefore , are without any terrours to hinder them from their duty .


It has been asserted , indeed , that the price of a license is now so small , that none who are inclined to deal in spirits will neglect to secure themselves from punishment and vexation by procuring it  and that no man will subject himself to the malice of a profligate , by carrying on an illicit trade , which the annual expense of twenty shillings will make legal .


If this argument be just , my lords , and to the greatest part of this assembly I believe it will appear very plausible , how will this law lessen the consumption of distilled liquors ?
It is confessed that it will hinder nobody from selling them  and it has been found , by experience , that nothing can restrain the people from buying them , but such laws as hinder them from being sold .


This plea , therefore , by removing an objection to a particular clause , will strengthen the great argument against the tenour of the bill , that instead of lessening , it will increase the consumption of those liquors which are allowed to be destructive to the people , to enfeeble the body , and to vitiate the mind , and , consequently , to impair the strength and commerce of the nation , and to destroy the happiness and security of life .


That the cheapness of licenses will induce multitudes to buy them , may be expected  but it can not be hoped that every one will cease to sell spirits without a license  for they , are , as I am informed , offered every hour in the streets by those to whom twenty shillings make a very large sum , and who , therefore , will not , or can not purchase a license .
These ought , undoubtedly , to be detected and punished  but there is no provision made for discovering them , but what has been found already to be ineffectual .


It appears , therefore , my lords , that this bill will increase the number of lawful retailers , without diminishing that of private dealers  so that the opportunities of debauchery will be multiplied , in proportion to the numbers who shall take licenses .


There is another fallacy by which the duties upon distilled liquors have been hitherto avoided , and which will still make this bill equally useless as the former , for the ends which are to be promoted by it .


It is expected , my lords , by those who purchase spirits from the distillers , that they should be of a certain degree of strength , which they call proof : if they are of a lower degree , their price is diminished  and if of a higher , it is raised proportionally  because if the spirits exceed the degree of strength required , they may be mixed with other liquors of little value , and still be sold to the drinker at the common price .


It is , therefore , the practice of the distillers to give their spirits thrice the degree of strength required , by which contrivance , though they pay only the duty of one pint , they sell their liquors at the price of three  because it may be increased to thrice the quantity distilled , and yet retain sufficient strength to promote the purposes of wickedness .


This practice , my lords , should be likewise obviated  for while one gallon , after having paid the present low duty which is laid upon it , may be multiplied to three , the additional price will , in the small quantities which are usually demanded , become imperceptible .


But to show yet farther the inefficacy of this bill , let us suppose , what will not be found by experience , that a halfpenny is added to the price of every pint , it will yet be very practicable to revel in drunkenness for a penny , since a very small quantity of these hateful liquors is sufficient to intoxicate those who have not been habituated to the use of them  who though their reformation is , undoubtedly , to be desired , do not so much demand the care of the legislature , as those who are yet untainted with this pernicious practice , and who may , perhaps , by the frequency of temptation , and the prevalence of example , be induced in time to taste these execrable liquors , and perish in their first essays of debauchery .
For such is the quality of these spirits , that they are sometimes fatal to those who indiscreetly venture upon them without caution , and whose stomachs have not been prepared for large draughts , by proper gradations of intemperance  a single spoonful has been found sufficient to hurry two children to the grave .


It is , therefore , my opinion , that those whose stations and employments make it their duty to superintend the conduct of their fellow-subjects , ought to contrive some other law on this occasion  ought to endeavour to rescue the common people from the infatuation which is become general amongst them , and to withhold from them the means of wickedness .
That instead of complying with their prejudices , and flattering their appetites , they should exert that authority with which they are intrusted in a steady and resolute opposition to predominant vices  and without having recourse to gentle arts , and temporizing expedients , snatch out of their hands at once those instruments which are only of use for criminal purposes , and take from their mouths that draught with which , however delicious it may seem , they poison at once themselves and their posterity .


The only argument which can be offered in defence of this bill , is the necessity of supporting the expenses of the war , and the difficulty of raising money by any other method .
The necessity of the war , my lords , I am not about to call in question , nor is it very consistent with my character to examine the method in which it has been carried on  but this I can boldly assert , that however just , however necessary , however prudently prosecuted , and however successfully concluded , it can produce no advantages equivalent to the national sobriety and industry , and am certain that no publick advantage ought to be purchased at the expense of publick virtue .


But , my lords , I hope we are not yet reduced to the unhappy choice either of corrupting our people , or submitting to our enemies  nor do I doubt but that supplies may be obtained by methods less pernicious to the publick , and that funds sufficient for the present occasion may be established without a legal establishment of drunkenness .


I hope , my lords , we shall not suffer our endeavours to be baffled by the obstinacy of drunkards  and that we shall not desist from endeavouring the recovery of the nation from this hateful vice , because our first attempt has failed , since it failed only by the negligence or the cowardice of those whose duty required them to promote the execution of a just law .


Against the bill now before us I have thought it my duty to declare , as it appears to me opposite to every principle of virtue , and every just purpose of government  and therefore , though I have engrossed so much of your time in speaking on a subject with which it can not reasonably be expected that I should be well acquainted , I hope I shall easily be pardoned by your lordships , since I have no private views either of interest or resentment to promote , and have spoken only what my conscience dictates , and my duty requires .


Lord TALBOT then rose up , and spoke to the following purport : -- My lords , I am ashamed that there should be any necessity of opposing in this assembly a bill like that which is now before us  a bill crowded with absurdities , which no strength of eloquence can exaggerate , nor any force of reason make more evident .


This bill , my lords , is , however , the first proof that our new ministers have given of their capacity for the task which they have undertaken  this is a specimen of their sagacity , and is designed by them as an instance of the gentle methods by which the expenses of the government are hereafter to be levied upon the people .
The nation shall no longer see its manufactures subjected to imposts , nor the fruits of industry taken from the laborious artificer  but drunkenness shall hereafter supply what has hitherto been paid by diligence and traffick  the restraints of vice shall be taken away , the barriers of virtue and religion broken , and an universal licentiousness shall overspread the land , that the schemes of the ministry may be executed .


What are the projects , my lords , that are to be pursued by such means , it is not my present purpose to inquire : it is not necessary to add any aggravations to the present charge , or to examine what has been the former conduct , or what will be the future actions of men who lie open by their present proposal to the most atrocious accusations  who are publickly endeavouring the propagation of the most pernicious of all vices , who are laying poison in the way of their countrymen , poison by which not only the body , but the mind is contaminated  who are attempting to establish by a law a practice productive of all the miseries to which human nature is incident  a practice which will at once disperse diseases and sedition , and promote beggary and rebellion .


This , my lords , is the expedient by which the acuteness of our ministry proposes to raise the supplies of the present year , and by this they hope to convince the nation that they are qualified for the high trusts to which they are advanced  and that they owe their exaltation only to the superiority of their abilities , the extent of their knowledge , and the maturity of their experience : by this masterstroke of policy they hope to lay for their authority a firm and durable foundation , and to possess themselves , by this happy contrivance , at once of the confidence of the crown , and the affections of the people .


But , my lords , I am so little convinced of their abilities , that amidst all the exultation which this new scheme produces , I will venture to predict the decline of their influence , and to fix the period of their greatness  for I am persuaded , that notwithstanding the readiness with which they have hitherto sacrificed the interest of their country , notwithstanding the desperate precipitation with which they have blindly engaged in the most dangerous measures , they will not be able to continue a year in their present stations .


The bill now under our consideration , my lords , will undoubtedly make all those their enemies whom it does not corrupt  for what can be expected from it , but universal disorder and boundless wickedness ?
wickedness made insolent by the protection of the law , and disorder promoted by all those whose wealth is increased by the increase of the revenues of the government .


Had it been urged , my lords , in defence of this bill , that it was necessary to raise money , and that money could only be raised by increasing the consumption of distilled spirits , it would have been apparent that it was well calculated to promote the purposes intended  but , surely , to assert that it will obstruct the use of these liquors , is to discover a degree either of ignorance , of effrontery , or of folly , by which few statesmen have been , hitherto , distinguished .


If we receive , without examination , the estimates which have been laid down , and allow the duty to rise as high as those by whom it is projected have ventured to assert , the price of these liquors can be raised but a halfpenny a pint  and there are few , even among the lowest of those who indulge themselves in this fatal luxury , whom the want of a single halfpenny can often debar from it .


And though these accurate calculators should insist that men may sometimes be compelled to sobriety by this addition to the expense of being drunk , yet how far will this restraint be found from being equivalent to the new temptation , which will be thrown into the way of thousands , yet uncorrupted by the multitude of new shops that will be opened for the distribution of poison , ` and the security which debauchery will obtain from the countenance of the legislature .


What will be the consequences of any encouragement given to a vice already almost irresistibly prevalent , I can not determine  but surely nothing is too dismal to be expected from universal drunkenness , from a general depravity of all the most useful part of mankind , from an epidemical fury of debauchery , and an unbounded exemption from restraint .


How little any encouragement is wanting to promote the consumption of those execrable liquors , how much it concerns every man who has been informed of their quality , and who has seen their consequences , to oppose the use of them with his utmost influence , appears from the enormous quantity which the stills of this nation annually produce .


The number of gallons which appears from the accounts on the table to have been consumed last year , is seven millions  ' a quantity sufficient to-destroy the health , interrupt the labour , and deprave the morals of a very great part of the nation  a quantity which , if it be suffered to continue undiminished , will , even without any legal encouragement of its use , in a short time destroy the happiness of the publick  and by impairing the strength , and lessening the number of manufacturers and labourers , introduce poverty and famine .


Instead , therefore , of promoting a practice so evidently detrimental to society , let us oppose it with the most vigorous efforts  let us begin our opposition by rejecting this bill , and then consider whether the execution of the former law shall be -- enforced , or whether another more efficacious can be formed .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY then spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , though it is undoubtedly the right of every person in this assembly to utter his sentiments with freedom , yet surely decency ought to restrain us from virulent , and justice from undeserved reproaches  we ought not to censure any conduct with more severity than it deserves , nor condemn any man for practices of which he is innocent .


This rule , which will not , I suppose , be controverted , has not , in my opinion , been very carefully observed in this debate  for surely nothing is more unjust than to assert or insinuate that the government has looked idly upon the advances of debauchery , or has suffered drunkenness to prevail without opposition .


Of the care with which this licentiousness has been opposed , no other proof can be required , than the laws which have , in the present reign , been made against it .
Soon after the succession of his majesty , the use of compound spirits was prohibited  but this law being eluded by substituting liquors , so drawn as not to be included in the statutes , it was soon after repealed  and the people were , for a time , indeed , suffered to drink distilled liquors without restraint , because a proper method of restraining them was not easily to be found .


How-difficult it was to contrive means by which this vice might safely be prevented , appeared more plainly soon afterwards , when the outrageous licentiousness of the populace made it necessary to contrive some new law by which the use of that liquor might be prohibited , to which so much insolence , idleness , and dissoluteness were imputed .


The law which it is now proposed to repeal , was then zealously promoted by those who were then most distinguished for their virtue and their prudence .
Every man who had any regard for the happiness of the publick , was alarmed at the inundation of licentiousness that overflowed this city , and began to spread itself to the remoter parts of the kingdom  and it was determined that nothing but a total .
prohibition of distilled liquors could preserve the peace , and restore the virtue of the nation .


A law was therefore made , which prohibited the retail of distilled spirits  and it was expected that the people would immediately return to the use of more innocent and healthful liquors , and that the new art of sudden intoxication would be wholly suppressed  but with how little knowledge of the dispositions of the nation this hope was formed , the event quickly discovered  for no sooner was the darling liquor withheld , than a general murmur was raised over all parts of this great city  and all the lower orders of the people testified their discontent in the most open manner .
Multitudes were immediately tempted by the prospect of uncommon gain , to retail the prohibited liquors  of these many were detected , and many punished  and the trade of information was so lucrative , and so closely followed , that there was no doubt but the law would produce the effect expected from it , and that the most obstinate retailers would , by repeated prosecutions , be discouraged from the practice .


But no sooner did the people find their favourite gratification in real danger , than they unanimously engaged in its defence  they discovered that without informers , the new law was without operation  and the informers were , therefore , persecuted by them without mercy , and without remission , till at last no man would venture to provoke the resentment of the populace for the reward to which information entitled him .


Thus , my lords , one law has been eluded by artifice , and another defeated by violence  the practice of drinking spirits , however pernicious , still continued to prevail  the magistrates could not punish a crime of which they were not informed , and they could obtain no information of a practice vindicated by the populace .


It is not , indeed , to be allowed that the custom of drinking distilled liquors , however prevalent , has yet arisen to the height at which the noble lord , who spoke last , seems to imagine it arrived  for though it is undoubtedly true that seven millions of gallons are annually distilled , it is not to be imagined that the whole quantity is wasted in debauchery !
some is , exhausted by the necessities , and some by the conveniencies of life  a great part is exported to other countries , and the distillery promotes many other purposes than those of riot and licentiousness .


That too much , however , is used by the common people , and that intemperance has for some time prevailed in a degree unknown to any former age , can not be denied  and , therefore , some means of reclaiming them ought to be tried .
What then , my lords , is to be done ?
The first law was eluded , the second is defied : the first was executed , but produced no restraint  the second produces a restraint so violent , that it can not be executed .


That the present law is ineffectual , can not be doubted by those who assert , that the quantity of spirits distilled has every year increased  and there seems to remain , therefore , no other choice than that of suffering this increase to proceed , or to endeavour to prevent it by new regulations .
The present law ought to be repealed , because it is useless  but surely some other ought to supply its place , which may be more easily enforced , and less violently opposed .


The bill now before us , my lords , will , in my opinion , answer all the purposes of the last , without noise , and without disturbance .
By lessening the price of licenses , it will put a stop to clandestine retail  and by raising that of the liquors , it will hinder the common people from drinking them in their usual excess .
Those who have hitherto lost their reason and limbs twice a-day by their drunkenness , will not be able , under the intended regulations , to commit the same crime twice in a week  and as the temptation of cheapness will be taken away , it may be hoped that the next generation will not fall into the same vice .


Since , therefore , my lords , the arguments in favour of this bill are at least plausible and specious  since the design appears to be worthy of this assembly , and the method proposed such as may be hoped to produce the effects which the projectors of the bill desire  and since the opinions of this house are at least divided , and the other has passed it almost without opposition , we ought at least , in my opinion , not to reject it with precipitation , but to refer it to a committee , that it may be fully considered  and those objections which can not be answered , removed by proper alterations .


Lord CARTERET spoke to the following purport : -- My lords , the bill now under our consideration appears to me to deserve a much more close regard than seems to have been paid to it in the other house , through which it was hurried with the utmost precipitation , and where it was passed , almost without the formality of a debate  nor can I think that earnestness with which some lords seem inclined to press it forward here , consistent with the importance of the consequences which may be with great reason expected from it ,


It has been urged , that where so great a number have formed expectations of a national benefit from any bill , so much deference , at least , is due to their judgment , as that the bill should be considered in a committee .
This , my lords , I admit to be in other cases a just and reasonable demand , and will readily allow that the proposal not only of a considerable number , but even of any single lord , ought to be fully examined , and regularly debated , according to the usual forms of this assembly .
But in the present case , my lords , and in all cases like the present , this demand is improper , because it is useless  and it is useless , because we can do now all that we can do hereafter in a committee .
For the bill before us is a money bill , which , according to the present opinion of the commons , we have no right to amend  and which , therefore , we have no need of considering in a committee , since the event of all our deliberations must be , that we are either to reject or pass it in its present state .
For I suppose no lord will think this a proper time to enter into a controversy with the commons for the revival of those privileges to which I believe we have a right , and such a controversy the least attempt to amend a money bill will certainly produce .


To desire , therefore , my lords , that this bill may be considered in a committee , is only to desire that it may gain one step without opposition  that it may proceed through the forms of the house by stealth , and that the consideration of it maybe delayed till the exigencies of the government shall be so great as not to allow time for raising the supplies by any other method .


By this artifice , gross as it is , the patrons of this wonderful bill hope to obstruct a plain and open detection of its tendency .
They hope , my lords , that the bill shall operate in the same manner with the liquor which it is intended to bring into more general use  and that as those that drink spirits are drunk before they are well aware that they are drinking , the effects of this law shall be perceived before we know that we have made it .
Their intent is to give us a dram of policy , which is to be swallowed before it is tasted , and which , when once it is swallowed , will turn our heads .


But , my lords , I hope we shall be so cautious as to examine the draught which these state empirics have thought proper to offer us  and I am confident that a very little examination will convince us of the pernicious qualities of their new preparation , and show that it can have no other effect than that of poisoning the publick .


The law before us , my lords , seems to be the effect of that practice , of which it is intended likewise to be the cause , and to be dictated by the liquor of which it so effectually promotes the use  for surely it never before was conceived , by any man intrusted with the administration of publick affairs , to raise taxes by the destruction of the people .


Nothing , my lords , but the destruction of all the most laborious and useful part of the nation can be expected , from the license which is now proposed to be given not only to drunkenness , but to drunkenness of the most detestable and dangerous kind , to the abuse not only of intoxicating , but of poisonous liquors .


Nothing , my lords , is more absurd than to assert , that the use of spirits will be hindered by the bill now before us , or indeed that it will not be in a very great degree promoted by it .
For what produces all kind of wickedness , but the prospect of impunity on one part , or the solicitation of opportunity on the other  either of these has too frequently been sufficient to overpower the sense of morality , and even of religion  and what is not to be feared from them , when they shall unite their force , and operate together  when temptations shall be increased , and terrour taken away ?


It is allowed by those who have hitherto disputed on either side of this question , that the people appear obstinately enamoured of this new liquor  it is allowed on both parts , that this liquor corrupts the mind , enervates the body , and destroys vigour and virtue at the same time  that it makes those who drink it too idle and too feeble for work  and , while it impoverishes them by the present expense , disables them from retrieving its ill consequences by subsequent industry .


It might be imagined , my lords , that those who had thus far agreed would not easily find any occasion of dispute  nor would any man , unacquainted with the motives by which senatorial debates are too often influenced , suspect , that after the pernicious qualities of this liquor , and the general inclination among the people to the immoderate use of it , had been generally admitted , it could be afterwards inquired , whether it ought to be made more common , whether this universal thirst for poison ought to be encouraged by the legislature , and whether a new statute ought to be made to secure drunkards in the gratification , of their appetites .


To pretend , my lords , that the design of this bill is to prevent or diminish the use of spirits , is to trample upon common sense , and to violate the rules of decency as well as of reason .
For when did any man hear , that a commodity was prohibited by licensing its sale ?
or that to offer and refuse is the same action ?


It is , indeed , pleaded , that it will be made dearer by the tax which is proposed , and that the increase of the price will diminish the numbers of the purchasers  but it is at the same time expected , that this tax shall supply the expense of a war on the continent : it is asserted , therefore , that the consumption of spirits will be hindered , and yet that it will be such as may be expected to furnish , from a very small tax , a revenue sufficient for the support of armies , for the reestablishment of the Austrian family , and the repression of the attempts of France .


Surely , my lords , these expectations are not very consistent , nor can it be imagined that they are both formed in the same head , though they may be expressed by the same mouth .
It is , however , some recommendation of a statesman , when of his assertions one can be found reasonable or true  and this praise can not be denied to our present ministers  for though it is undoubtedly false , that this tax will lessen the consumption of spirits , it is certainly true , that it will produce a very large revenue , a revenue that will not fail but with the people from whose debaucheries it arises .


Our ministers will , therefore , have the same honour with their predecessors , of having given rise to a new fund , not indeed for the payment of our debts , but for much more valuable purposes , for the exaltation of our hearts under oppression , for the elevation of our spirits amidst miscarriages and disappointments , and for the cheerful support of those debts which we have lost hopes of paying .
They are resolved , my lords , that the nation , which nothing can make wise , shall , while they are at its head , at least be merry  and since publick happiness is the end of government , they seem to imagine that they shall deserve applause by an expedient , which will enable every man to lay his cares asleep , to drown sorrow , and lose in the delights of drunkenness both the publick miseries and his own .


Surely , my lords , men of this unbounded benevolence , and this exalted genius , deserve such honours as were never paid before  they deserve to bestride a butt upon every signpost in the metropolis , or to have their countenances exhibited as tokens where this liquor is to be sold by the license which they have procured .
They must be at least remembered to future ages , as the happy politicians who , after all expedients for raising taxes had been employed , discovered a new method of draining the last relicks of the publick wealth , and added a new revenue to the government  nor will those , who shall hereafter enumerate the several funds now established among us , forget , among the benefactors to their country , the illustrious authors of the drinking fund .


May I be allowed , my lords , to congratulate my countrymen and fellow-subjects upon the happy times which are now approaching , in which no man will be disqualified for the privilege of being drunk , when all discontent and disloyalty shall be forgotten , and the people , though now considered by the ministry as their enemies , shall acknowledge the lenity of that government , under which all restraints are taken away .


But to a bill for such desirable purposes , it would be proper , my lords , to prefix a preamble , in which the kindness of our intentions should be more fully explained , that the nation may not mistake our indulgence for cruelty , nor consider their benefactors as their persecutors .
If , therefore , this bill be considered and amended , ( for why else should it be considered ? )
in a committee , I shall humbly propose , that it shall be introduced in this manner : `` Whereas the designs of the present ministry , whatever they are , can not be executed without a great number of mercenaries , which mercenaries can not be hired without money  and whereas the present disposition of this nation to drunkenness inclines us to believe , that they will pay more cheerfully for the undisturbed enjoyment of distilled liquors , than for any other concession that can be made by the government , be it enacted , by the king 's most excellent majesty , that no man shall hereafter be denied the right of being drunk , on the following conditions . ''


This , my lords , to trifle no longer , is the proper preamble to this bill , which contains only the conditions on which the people of this kingdom are to be allowed henceforward to riot in debauchery , in debauchery licensed by law , and countenanced by the magistrates  for there is no doubt but those on whom the inventors of this tax shall confer authority , will be directed to assist their masters in their design to encourage the consumption of that liquor from which such large revenues are expected , and to multiply , without end , those licenses which are to pay a yearly tribute to the crown .


By this unbounded license , my lords , that price will be lessened , from the increase of which the expectations of the efficacy of this law are pretended  for the number of retailers will lessen the value as in all other cases , and lessen it more than this tax will increase it .
Besides , it is to be considered , that at present the retailer expects to be paid for the danger which he incurs by an unlawful trade , and will not trust his reputation or his purse to the mercy of his customer , without a profit proportioned to the hazard  but when once the restraint shall be taken away , he will sell for common gain  and it can hardly be imagined , that at present he subjects himself to informations and penalties for less than sixpence a gallon .


The specious pretence on which this bill is founded , and , indeed , the only pretence that deserves to be termed specious , is the propriety of taxing vice  but this maxim of government has , on this occasion , been either mistaken or perverted .
Vice , my lords , is not properly to be taxed , but suppressed  and heavy taxes are sometimes the only means by which that suppression can be attained .
Luxury , my lords , or the excess of that which is pernicious only by its excess , may very properly be taxed , that such excess , though not strictly unlawful , may be made more difficult .
But the use of those things which are simply hurtful , hurtful in their own nature , and in every degree , is to be prohibited .
None , my lords , ever heard in any nation of a tax upon theft or adultery , because a tax implies a license granted for the use of that which is taxed , to all who shall be willing to pay it .


Drunkenness , my lords , is universally and in all circumstances an evil , and , therefore , ought not to be taxed , but punished  and the means of it not to be made easy by a slight impost , which none can feel , but to be removed out of the reach of the people , and secured by the heaviest taxes , levied with the utmost rigour .
I hope those to whose care the religion of the nation is particularly consigned , will unanimously join with me in maintaining the necessity , not of taxing vice , but suppressing it  and unite for the rejection of a bill , by which the future as well as present happiness of thousands must be destroyed .


Lord LONSDALE spoke as follows : -- My lords , the bill now before us , has , from its first appearance in the other house , seemed to me of such importance as to deserve the greatest attention , and to demand the most diligent inquiry  and I have , therefore , considered it with uncommon care , and pursued all those inquiries from which I could expect any assistance for discovering its tendency and its consequences , with the nicest and most anxious vigilance .


That my attention and diligence may not wholly terminate in the gratification of idle and useless curiosity , it is proper to inform your lordships of their result  by which I hope to convince you , as I am myself convinced , that this bill can not become a law , without endangering the lives of thousands , without dispersing diseases over the nation , or without multiplying crimes beyond the possibility of restraint or punishment  that it will fill the land with confusion for a time , by infatuating the people , and afterwards lay it desolate by destroying them .


All my inquiries , my lords , have had one constant and uniform Effect .
On what side soever I have turned my speculations , I have found new arguments against this bill , and have discovered new mischiefs comprised in it  mischiefs which , however some may endeavour to overlook them , and others to despise them , will be found in a short time too general to be concealed , and too formidable to be neglected .


The first consideration , in which the necessity of deliberating on this bill engaged me , related to the quality of the liquors which are mentioned in it .
With regard to this question , my lords , there was no possibility of long suspense  for the pernicious effects of spirits were confessed equally by all those who countenanced and opposed this new project  nor could any man take a survey of this city without meeting in his way such objects as might make all farther inquiry superfluous .
The idleness , the insolence , the debauchery of the common people , and their natural and certain consequences , poverty , diseases , misery , and wickedness , are to be observed without any intention of indulging such disagreeable speculations  in every part of this great metropolis , whoever shall pass along the streets , will find wretches stretched upon the pavement , insensible and motionless , and only removed by the charity of passengers from the danger of being crushed by carriages , or trampled by horses , or strangled with filth in the common sewers  and others , less helpless perhaps , but more dangerous , who have drank too much to fear punishment , but not enough to hinder them from provoking it  who think themselves , in the elevation of drunkenness , entitled to treat all those with contempt whom their dress distinguishes from them , and to resent every injury which , in the heat of their imagination , they suppose themselves to suffer , with the utmost rage of resentment , violence of rudeness , and scurrility of tongue .


No man can pass a single hour in publick places without meeting such objects , or hearing such expressions as disgrace human nature  such as can not be looked upon without horrour , or heard without indignation , and which there is , however , no possibility of removing or preventing , whilst this hateful liquor is publickly sold .
But the visible and obvious effects of these pernicious draughts , however offensive or inconvenient , are yet much less to be dreaded than their more slow and secret operations .
That excess of distilled spirits inflames the poor to insolence and fury  that it exposes them either to hurt , by making them insensible of danger , or to punishment , by making them fearless of authority , is not to be reckoned the most fatal consequence of their use  for these effects , though their frequency makes it necessary to suppress them , with regard to each individual are of no long duration  the understanding is in a short time recovered after a single debauch , and the drunkard may return to his employment .


But though the pleasures of drunkenness are quickly at an end , its pains are of longer continuance .
These liquors not only infatuate the mind , but poison the body  nor do they produce only momentary fury , but incurable debility and lingering diseases  they not only fill our streets with madmen , and our prisons with criminals , but our hospitals with cripples .
Those who have for a time infested the publick walks with their insults , quickly disturb them with their lamentations , and are soon reduced from bullies to beggars , and obliged to solicit alms from those they used to threaten and insult .


Nor does the use of spirits , my lords , only impoverish the publick , by lessening the number of useful and laborious hands , but by cutting off those recruits by which its natural and inevitable losses are to be supplied .
The use of distilled liquors impairs the fecundity of the human race , and hinders that increase which providence has ordained for the support of the world .
Those women who riot in this poisonous debauchery are quickly disabled from bearing children , by bringing on themselves , in a short time , all the infirmities and weaknesses of age  or , what is yet more destructive to general happiness , produce children diseased from their birth by the vices of their parents , children whose blood is tainted with inveterate and accumulated maladies , for which no cure can be expected  ` and who , therefore , are an additional burden to the community , and must be supported through a miserable life by that labour which they can not share , and must be protected by that community of which they can not contribute to the defence .


Thus , my lords , is the great source of power and wealth dried up , the numbers of the people are every day diminished , and , by consequence , our armies must be weakened , our trade abandoned , and our lands uncultivated .
To diminish the people of any nation is the most atrocious political crime that it is possible to commit  for it tends not to enslave or impoverish , but to annihilate  not to make a nation miserable , but to make it no longer a nation .


Such , my lords , are the effects of distilled liquors  effects of which I would not have shocked you with the enumeration , had it not been with a design of preventing them  and surely no man will be charged with so trivial an offence as negligence of delicacy , when he is pleading , not for the honour or the life of a single man , but for the peace of the present age , the health of posterity , and the existence of the British people .


After having examined the nature of these liquors , it is natural to inquire , how much they are in use  whether mankind appear to know their quality , and avoid and detest them like other poisons  or whether they are considered as inoffensive , and drank , like other liquors , to raise the spirits , or to gladden the heart  whether they make part of social entertainments , and whether they are handed round at publick tables , without any suspicion of their fatal consequences .


It is well known , my lords , that these liquors have not been long in use among the common people .
Spirits were at first only imported from foreign countries , and were , by consequence , too dear for the luxuries of the vulgar .
In time it was discovered , that it was practicable to draw from grain , and other products of our own soil , such liquors as , though not equally pleasing to elegant palates with those of other nations , resembled them , at least in their inebriating quality , and might be afforded at an easy rate , and consequently generally purchased .


This discovery , my lords , gave rise to the new trade of distilling , which has been now for many years carried on in this nation , and of the progress of which , since the duties were laid upon its produce , an exact account may be easily obtained , which I thought so necessary in our deliberations on this bill , that I have procured it to be drawn out .


From this account , my lords , it will be discovered , what can not be related without the utmost grief , that there has prevailed , for many years , a kind of contagious infatuation among the common people , by which they have been incited to poison themselves and their children with distilled spirits  they have forsaken those liquors which in former times enlivened their conversation and exalted their merriment , and , instead of ale and beer , rioted of late in distilled spirits .


The amazing increase of the consumption of spirits for the last ten years , is a proof too evident of the prevalence of this destructive species of drunkenness  and I shall , therefore , without troubling your lordships with earlier accounts , only mention in round numbers , the vast quantities for which the duty has been paid for a few years in that period .
In the year 1733 , the number of gallons distilled was three millions and nine hundred thousand , which in 1735 was increased to five millions and three hundred thousand  soon afterwards the law was made which we are now persuaded to repeal , by the execution of which , however feeble and irresolute , the number was reduced in the first year afterwards to three millions , and might , perhaps , by steady perseverance have been every year lessened  but in a short time the people prevailed in the contest with the legislators , they intimidated information , and wearied prosecution  and were at length allowed to indulge themselves in the enjoyment of their favourite vice without any farther molestation .


The effects of this indulgence , my lords , have been very remarkable  nor can it be denied , that the government betrayed great weakness in suffering the laws to be overruled by drunkenness , and the meanest and most profligate of the people to set the statutes at defiance  for the vice which had been so feebly opposed spread wider and wider , and every year added regularly another million of gallons to the quantity of spirits distilled , till in the last year they rose to seven millions and one hundred thousand gallons .


Such , my lords , is at present the state of the nation  twelve millions of gallons of these poisonous liquors are every year swallowed by the inhabitants of this kingdom  and this quantity , enormous as it is , will probably every year increase , till the number of the people shall be sensibly diminished by the diseases which it must produce  nor shall we find any decay of this pernicious trade , but by the general mortality that will overspread the kingdom .


At least , if this vice should be suppressed , it must be suppressed by some supernatural interposition of providence  for nothing is more absurd , than to imagine , that the bill now before us can produce any such effect .
For what , my lords , encourages any man to a crime but security from punishment , or what tempts him to the commission of it but frequent opportunity ?
We are , however , about to reform the practice of drinking spirits , by making spirits more easy to be procured  we are about to hinder them from being bought , by exempting the vender from all fear of punishment .


It has , indeed , been asserted , that the tax now to be laid upon these liquors will have such wonderful effects , that those who are at present drunk twice a-day , will not be henceforward able to commit the same crime twice a-week  an assertion which I could not hear without wondering at the new discoveries which ministerial sagacity can sometimes make .
In deliberations on a subject of such importance , my lords , no man ought to content himself with conjecture , where certainty may , at whatsoever expense of labour , be attained  nor ought any man to neglect a careful and attentive examination of his notions , before he offers them in publick consultations  for if they were erroneous , and no man can he certain that he is in the right , who has never brought his own opinions to the test of inquiry , he exposes himself to be detected in ignorance or temerity , and to that contempt which such detection naturally and justly produces  or if his audience submit their reason to his authority , and neglect to examine his assertions , in confidence that he has sufficiently examined them himself , he may suffer what to an honest mind must be far more painful than any personal ignominy , he may languish under the consciousness of having influenced the publick counsels by false declarations , and having by his negligence betrayed his country to calamities which a closer attention might have enabled him to have foreseen .


Whether the noble lord , who alleged the certainty of reformation which this bill will produce , ever examined his own opinion , I know not  but think it necessary at least to consider it more particularly , to supply that proof of it which , if it be true , he neglected to produce , or to show , if it be found false , how little confident assertions are to be regarded .


Between twice a-day and twice a-week , the noble lord will not deny the proportion to be as seven to one  and , therefore , to prevent drunkenness in the degree which he persuades us to expect , the price of the liquor must be raised in the same proportion  but the duty laid upon the gallon will not increase the price a fifth part , even though it should not be eluded by distilling liquors of an extraordinary strength  one fifth part of the price is , therefore , in his lordship 's estimate , equal to the whole price seven times multiplied .
Such are the arguments which have been produced in favour of this bill  and such is the diligence with which the publick happiness is promoted by those who have hopes of being enriched by publick calamities .


As the tax will not make a fifth part of the price , and even that may be in some measure evaded , the duty paid for licenses scarcely deserves consideration  for it is not intended to hinder retailers , but to make them useful in some degree to the ministry , by paying a yearly tax for the license of poisoning .


It is , therefore , apparent , upon the noble lord 's supposition , that the price of the liquor will be raised in consequence of this tax , that no man can be hindered from more than a fifth part of his usual debauchery , which , however , would be some advantage to the publick  but even this small advantage can not be expected from the bill , because one part will obstruct the benefits that might be hoped from another .


The duty upon liquors , however inconsiderable , will be necessarily an augmentation of the price to the first buyer , but probably that augmentation will be very little felt by the consumer .
For , my lords , it must be considered , that many circumstances concur to constitute the price of any commodity  the price of what is in itself cheap , may be raised by the art or the condition of those that sell it  what is engrossed by a few hands , is sold dearer than when the same quantity is dispersed in many  and what is sold in security , and under the protection of the law , is cheaper than that which exposes the vender to prosecutions and penalties .


At present , my lords , distilled spirits are sold in opposition to the laws of the kingdom  and , therefore , it is reasonable , as has been before observed , to believe that an extraordinary profit is expected , because no man will incur danger without advantage .
It is at present retailed , for the greatest part , by indigent persons , who can not be supposed to buy it in large quantities , and , consequently , not at the cheapest rate  and who must , of necessity , gain a large profit , because they are to subsist upon a very small stock .


These causes concurring , may be easily imagined to raise the price more than a fifth part above the profit which is expected in other traffick  but when this bill shall become a law , the necessity of large profit will no longer subsist  for there will then be no danger in retailing spirits , and they will be chiefly sold in houses by persons who can afford to purchase them in great quantities , who can be trusted by the distiller , for the usual time allowed in other trades  and who , therefore , may sell them without any exorbitant advantage .


Besides , my lords , it is reasonable to imagine , that the present profit to the retailer is very great , since , like that which arises from the clandestine exportation of wool , it is sufficient to tempt multitudes to a breach of the law , a contempt of penalties , and a defiance of the magistrates  and it may be therefore imagined , that there is room for a considerable abatement of the price , which may subtract much more than is added by this new duty .


This deduction from the price , my lords , will probably be soon produced by the emulation of retailers , who , when the trade becomes safe and publick , will endeavour to attract buyers by low rates  for what the noble lord , whose ingenious assertion I am now opposing , has declared with respect to traders , that for a tax of a penny upon any commodity , they oblige the consumers to advance twopence , is not universally true  and I believe it is as likely , that the people will insist upon having the same liquor at the usual price , without regard to the tax , as that the venders will be able to raise their price in an unreasonable proportion .
The obstinacy of the people with regard to this liquor , my lords , has already appeared  and I am inclined to believe , that they who have confessedly conquered the legislature , will not suffer themselves to be overcome in the same cause by the avarice of alehouse keepers .


I am , therefore , confident , my lords , that this bill will produce no beneficial effects , even in this city  and that in the country , where the sale of spirits was hindered by the late law , or where , at least , it might have been hindered in a great measure , it will propagate wickedness and debauchery in a degree never yet known  the torrent of licentiousness will break at once upon it , and a sudden freedom from restraint will produce a wanton enjoyment of privileges which had never been thought so valuable , had they never been taken away .
Thus , while the crowds of the capital are every day thinned by the licensed distributors of poison , the country , which is to be considered as the nursery in which the human species is chiefly propagated , will be made barren  and that race of men will be intercepted , which is to defend the liberty of the neighbouring nations in the next age , which is to extend our commerce to other kingdoms , or repel the encroachments of future usurpation .


The bill , my lords , will , therefore , produce none of the advantages which those who promote it have had the confidence to promise the publick .
But let us now examine whether they have not been more sagacious in securing the benefits which they expect from it themselves .


That one of the intentions of it is to raise a sum to supply the present exigencies of the government is not denied  that this is the only intention is generally believed , and believed upon the strongest reasons  for it is the only effect which it can possibly produce  and to this end it is calculated with all the skill of men long versed in the laudable art of contriving taxes and of raising money .


I have already shown to your lordships , that seven millions of gallons of spirits are annually distilled in this kingdom  this consumption , at the small duty of sixpence a gallon , now to be imposed , will produce a yearly revenue of # 175,000 .
and the tax upon licenses may be rated at a very large sum  so that there is a fund sufficient , I hope , for the expenses which a land war is to bring upon us .


But we are not to forget , my lords , that this is only the produce of the first year , and that the tax is likely to afford every year a larger revenue .
As the consumption of those liquors , under its late discouragements , has advanced a million of gallons every year , it may be reasonably imagined , that by the countenance of the legislature , and the protection of authority , it will increase in a double proportion  and that in ten years more , twenty millions will be distilled every year for the destruction of the people .


Thus far , my lords , the scheme of the ministry appears prosperous  but all prosperity , at least all the prosperity of dishonesty , must in time have an end .
The practice of drinking can not be for ever continued , because it will hurry the present generation to the grave , and prevent the production of another  the revenue must cease with the consumption , and the consumption must be at an end when the consumers are destroyed .


But this , my lords , can not speedily happen , nor have our ministers any dread of miseries which are only to fall in distant times upon another generation .
It is sufficient for them , if their expedient can supply those exigencies which their counsels have brought upon the publick  if they pay their court to the crown with success , at whatever disadvantage to the people , and continue in power till they have enlarged their fortunes , and then without punishment retire to enjoy them .


But I hope , my lords , that we shall act upon very different principles  that we shall examine the most distant consequences of our resolutions , and consider ourselves , not as the agents of the crown to levy taxes , but as the guardians of the people to promote the publick happiness  that we shall always remember that happiness can be produced only by virtue  and that since this bill can tend only to the increase of debauchery , we shall , without the formality of a commitment , unanimously reject it with indignation and abhorrence .


Lord CARTERET spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , the bill now before us has been examined with the utmost acuteness , and opposed with all the arts of eloquence and argumentation  nor has any topick been forgotten that could speciously be employed against it .
It has been represented by some as contrary to policy , and by others as opposite to religion  its consequences have been displayed with all the confidence of prediction , and the motives upon which it has been formed , declared to be such as I hope every man abhors who projected or defends it .


It has been asserted , that this bill owes its existence only to the necessity of raising taxes for the support of unnecessary troops , to be employed in useless and dangerous expeditions  and that those who defend it have no regard to the happiness or virtue of the people , nor any other design than to raise supplies , and gratify the ministry .


In pursuance of this scheme of argument , the consequences of this bill have been very artfully deduced , and very copiously explained  and it has been asserted that by passing it , we shall show ourselves the patrons of vice , the defenders of debauchery , and the promoters of drunkenness .


It has been declared , that in consequence of this law , by which the use of distilled liquors is intended to be restrained , the retailers of them will be multiplied , and multiplied without end  till the corruption , which is already too extensive , is become general , and the nation is transformed into a herd of drunkards .


With regard to the uses to which the money which shall arise from this tax is to be applied , though it has been more than once mentioned in this debate , I shall pass it over , as without any connexion with the question before us .
To confound different topicks may be useful to those whose design is to impose upon the inattention or weakness of their opponents , as they may be enabled by it to alter sometimes the state of the controversy , and to hide their fallacies in perplexity and confusion  but always to be avoided by those who endeavour to discover and to establish truth , who dispute not to confound but to convince , and who intend not to disturb the publick deliberations , but assist them .


I shall , therefore , my lords , only endeavour to show that the consequence , of which some lords express , and I believe with sincerity , such dreadful apprehensions , is not in reality to be feared from this bill  that it will probably promote the purpose for which it is declared to be calculated , and that it will by no means produce that havock in the human species which seems to be suspected , or diffuse that corruption through the people which has been confidently foretold .


The present state of this vice , my lords , has been fully explained , as well by those who oppose the bill as by those who defend it .
The use of distilled liquors is now prohibited by a penal law , but the execution of this law , as of all others of the same kind , necessarily supposes a regular information of the breach of it to be laid before the magistrate .
The people consider this law , however just or necessary , as an act of the most tyrannical cruelty , which ought to be opposed with the utmost steadiness and vigour , as an insupportable hardship from which they ought at any rate to set themselves free .


They have determined , therefore , not to be governed by this law , and have , consequently , endeavoured to hinder its execution  and so vigorous have been their efforts , that they have at last prevailed .
At first they only opposed it by their perseverance and obstinacy , they resolved to persist in the practice of retailing liquors without regard to the penalties which they might incur by it  and , therefore , as one was put to prison , his place was immediately supplied by another  and so frequent were the informations and so fruitless the penalties , that the chief magistrate of the metropolis lamented publickly in the other house , the unpleasing necessity to which he was subjected by that law , of fining and imprisoning without end , and without hopes of procuring the reformation that was intended .
Thus they proceeded for some time , and appeared to hope that the magistrates would after a while connive at a practice , which they should find no degree of severity sufficient to suppress  that they would sink under the fatigue of punishing to no purpose , that they would by degrees relax their vigilance , and leave the people in quiet possession of that felicity which they appeared to rate at so high a price .


At length , my lords , instead of wearying the magistrates , they grew weary themselves , and determined no longer to bear persecution for their enjoyments , but to resist that law which they could not evade , and to which they would not submit .
They , therefore , determined to mark out all those who by their informations promoted its execution , as publick enemies , as wretches who , for the sake of a reward , carried on a trade of perjury and persecution , and who harassed their innocent neighbours only for carrying on a lawful employment for supplying the wants of the poor , relieving the weariness of the labourer , administering solace to the dejected , and cordials to the sick .


The word was , therefore , given that no informer should be spared  and when an offender was summoned by the civil officers , crowds watched at the door of the magistrate to rescue the prisoner , and to discover and seize the witness upon whose testimony he was convicted  and unfortunate was the wretch who , with the imputation of this crime upon him , fell into their hands  it is well remembered by every man who at that time was conversant in this city , with what outcries of vengeance an informer was pursued in the publick streets , and in the open day  with what exclamations of triumph he was seized , and with what rage of cruelty he was tormented .


One instance of their fury I very particularly remember : as a man was passing along the streets , the alarm was given that he was an informer against the retailers of spirituous liquors , the populace were immediately gathered as in a time of common danger , and united in the pursuit as of a beast of prey , which it was criminal not to destroy  the man discovered , either by consciousness or intelligence , his danger , and fled for his life with the utmost precipitation  but no housekeeper durst afford him shelter , the cry increased upon him on all hands , and the populace rolled on after him with a torrent not to be resisted  and he was upon the point of being overtaken , and like some others destroyed , when one of the greatest persons in the nation , hearing the tumult , and inquiring the reason , opened his doors to the distressed fugitive , and sheltered him from a cruel death .


Soon afterwards there was a stop put to all information  no man dared afterwards , for the sake of a reward , expose himself to the fury of the people , and the use of these destructive liquors was no longer obstructed .
How much the practice of this kind of debauchery prevailed , after this short restraint , and how much the consumption of these destructive liquors has increased , the noble lord who spoke last has very accurately informed us , nor can any argument be offered for the present bill more strong than that which his computations have already furnished .


For if it appears , my lords , and it can not be doubted after such authentick testimonies , that seven millions of gallons of spirits are every year consumed in this kingdom , and that of these far the greatest quantity is wasted in the most flagitious and destructive debauchery  it is surely at length necessary to consider by what means this consumption , which can not be stopped , may be lessened , and this vice obstructed , which can not be reformed .


By opening a sufficient number of licensed shops , the number of unlicensed retailers will be necessarily lessened , and by raising the price of the liquor , the quantity which the poor drink must , with equal certainty , be diminished  and as it can not be imagined that the number of those who will pay annually for licenses , can be equal to that of the petty traders , who now dispose of spirits in cellars and in the streets  it is reasonable to believe that since there will be fewer sellers , less will be sold .


Some lords have , indeed , declared their suspicion , that the number of licensed shops will be such as will endanger the health of the people , and the peace of the commonwealth  and one has so far indulged his imagination , as to declare that he expects fifteen hundred shops to be set open for the sale of spirits , in a short time after the publication of this law .


If it be answered , that no spirits can be sold but by those who keep a house of publick entertainment by a license from the justices of the peace , the opponents of the bill have a reply ready , that the justices will take all opportunities to promote the increase of the revenue , and will always grant a license when it is demanded , without regard to the mischiefs that may arise from the increase of the retreats of idleness and receptacles of vice  and that , therefore , to allow justices to grant licenses for the retail of any commodity upon which a tax is laid , is to permit the sale of it without limits .


But , my lords , this argument will vanish , when it is considered that those justices to whom the law commits the superintendency of publick-houses , are superintended themselves by men who derive their authority from a higher power , and whose censures are more formidable than judicial penalties .
The conduct of the justices , my lords , as of every other person , lies open to the observation of the reverend clergy , by whose counsels it is to be regulated , and by whose admonitions it ought to be reformed  admonitions which can not be supposed to be without force from men to whom the great province of preaching virtue and truth is committed , and whose profession is so much reverenced , that reputation and infamy are generally in their power .


Should the justices , my lords , abuse their authority , either for the increase of the revenue , or any other purpose , what could they expect but to be marked out on the next day of publick worship for reproach and derision ?
What could they hope but that their crimes should be displayed in the most odious view to their neighbours , their children , and their dependants  and that all those from whom nature or interest teaches them to desire friendship , reverence , or esteem , will be taught to consider them as the slaves of power and the agents of villany , as the propagators of debauchery , and the enemies of mankind ?


There is , therefore , my lords , reason to hope that the bill may be useful , because it will be hindered from being detrimental  and as there is an absolute necessity of doing something , and no better method can at present be proposed , I think this ought not to be rejected .
We have found by experience that the publick is not to be reformed at once , and that the progress from corruption to reformation must be gradual  and as this bill enforces some degrees of amendment , it is at least more eligible than the present law , which is wholly without effect , because no man will dare to put it in execution .


Every man must be convinced , by his own experience , of the difficulty with-which long habits are surmounted .
I myself suffer some indulgence which yet I can not prevail upon myself to forbear  this indulgence is the use of too much snuff , to which it is well known that many persons of rank are not less addicted  and , therefore , I do not wonder that the law is ineffectual , which is to encounter with the habits and appetites of the whole mass of the common people .


For this reason , my lords , I can not approve what has been recommended in this debate , any new law that may put the enjoyment of this liquor yet farther from them , by facilitating prosecutions , or enforcing penalties , as I am convinced that the natural force of the people is superiour to the law , and that their natural force will be exerted for the defence of their darling spirits , and the whole nation be shaken with universal sedition .


It has been objected by the noble lord , that the tax now proposed is such as never was raised in any government , because , though luxury may confessedly be taxed , vice ought to be constantly suppressed  and this , in his lordship 's opinion , is a tax upon vice .


His lordship 's distinction between luxury and vice , between the use of things unlawful , and the excess of things lawful , is undoubtedly just , but by no means applicable on this occasion  nor , indeed , has the noble lord , with all his art , been able to apply it  for he was obliged to change the terms in his argument  and , instead of calling this tax , a tax upon strong liquors , to stigmatize it with the odious appellation of a tax upon drunkenness .


To call any thing what it really is not , and then to censure it , is very easy  too easy , my lords , to be done with success .
To confute the argument it is only necessary to observe , that this tax is not a tax upon drunkenness , but a tax laid upon strong liquors for the prevention of drunkenness  and , by consequence , such as falls within the compass of his own definition .


That it is not a tax upon luxury can not be inferred from the indigence of those whom it is intended to reform  for luxury is , my lords , ad modum possidentis , of different kinds , in proportion to different conditions of life , and one man may very decently enjoy those delicacies or pleasures to which it would be foolish and criminal in another to aspire .
Whoever spends upon superfluities what he must want for the necessities of life , is luxurious  and excess , therefore , of distilled spirits may be termed , with the utmost propriety , the luxury of the poor .


This , my lords , appeared to be the opinion of the noble lord who spoke so copiously on this question at the beginning of the debate  of this opinion was the reverend prelate when he observed , that necessity itself was become luxurious , and of this opinion must every man be who advises such a duty to be laid upon these liquors as may at once debar the poor from the use of them  for such a proposal evidently supposes them unnecessary , and all enjoyment of things not necessary is a degree of luxury .


To tax this luxury , which is , perhaps , the most pernicious of all others , is now proposed  but it is proposed to tax it only to suppress it , to suppress it by such slow degrees as may be borne by the people  and I hope a law so salutary will not be opposed only because it may afford the government a present supply .


The duke of NEWCASTLE then rose up , and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , I am of opinion that this debate would have been much shorter , had not the noble lords who have spoken in it suffered themselves to be led away , either by their own zeal , or the zeal of their opponents , from the true state of the question , to which I shall take the liberty of recalling their attention , that this important controversy may have at length an end .


The point , the only point that is , in my opinion , now to be considered , is this : the people of this nation have for some time practised a most pernicious and hateful kind of debauchery  against which several laws have been already made , which experience has shown to be so far without effect , that the disorder has every year increased among them  [ while the duke was speaking , the bishop of ORFORD said , without intention to be overheard , `` Yes , that is the true state of the case , '' upon which the duke stopped , and asked whether his lordship had any objection to make , who answered that he had no design of interrupting him  and he , therefore , proceeded . ]
A new law , therefore , is proposed , less severe , indeed , than the former , but which it is hoped will be for that reason more efficacious  this law having passed through the other house , is now , in the common course of our procedure , to be considered by us in a committee .


We are now , my lords , therefore , to resolve , whether a bill for the reformation of this flagrant vice deserves any farther deliberation , whether we shall join with the other house in their endeavours to restore the ancient sobriety and virtue of the British people , or , by an open disapprobation of their attempt , discourage them from prosecuting their design , and debar them from using the opportunities that succeeding years may afford , and the new lights which experience may supply for improving this essay , however imperfect , to a salutary and unexceptionable law .


The prelates whose laudable zeal for the promotion of virtue has prompted them to distinguish themselves on this occasion by an uncommon warmth of opposition , ought , as they appear fully sensible of the calamities which intemperance brings upon mankind , to consider likewise the consequences of refusing to examine , in a committee , a bill professedly drawn up to restrain intemperance .
They ought to remember , that by rejecting this bill without a particular examination of the several clauses which it contains , and without those particular objections which such examinations necessarily produce , we shall discover a contempt of the wisdom or virtue of the other house , which may incline them in their turn to obstruct the measures of the government , or at least to neglect that evil , however great , for the redress of which they have no reason to expect our concurrence .


Those whose particular province it is to inspect the lives of the people , to recal them from vice , and strengthen them in virtue , should certainly reflect on this occasion , that the safest method ought to be chosen  and , therefore , that this bill ought to be promoted  because , not to affirm too much , it is possible that it may produce some degree of reformation  and the worst that can be feared is , that , like the present law , it will be ineffectual  for the corruption and licentiousness of the people are already such , that nothing can increase them .


The bishop of SARUM then spoke to the following purpose : -- My lords , I am so far from being convinced by the arguments of the noble duke , that the bill now before us ought to be committed without farther opposition , that , in my opinion , nothing can be more unworthy of the honour of this house , or more unsuitable to the character which those who sit on this bench ought to desire , than to agree to any vote which may have the most distant appearance of approbation .


That a bill drawn up for the reformation of manners , for the restraint of a predominant and destructive vice , for the promotion of virtue , and the enforcement of religion , ought , at least , to be calmly and particularly considered  that the laudable endeavours of the commons ought not to be discouraged by a precipitate and contemptuous rejection of the measures which they have formed for the attainment of a purpose so important , is , indeed , a specious and plausible method of persuasion  but , my lords , it can affect only those who come to deliberate upon this bill without having read it .


A very slight and cursory perusal of the bill , my lords , will dissipate all the mists which eloquence can raise  it will show that the law now proposed can neither be useful nor ineffectual , but that it must operate very powerfully , though in a manner by no means agreeable to its title .


To prevent the excessive use of any thing , by allowing it to be sold without restraint , is an expedient which the wisdom of no former age ever discovered  it is , indeed , a fallacy too gross to be admitted , even by the most inconsiderate negligence , or the most contemptuous stupidity  nor am I at all inclined to believe , that the commons will impute the rejection of this bill to our disregard of virtue , or think that we have defeated any endeavours for the suppression of wickedness .


It has been affirmed , that though by the bill the sale is permitted , it is permitted only because it can not be hindered  and that the price is raised so high , that , though the lawful venders may be multiplied , the number of the purchasers must be diminished .
But even this argument , like all others that have yet been advanced , is confuted by the bill itself , from which the tax now proposed appears to be such as , when subdivided by the small measures in which retailers sell these liquors , will scarcely be perceived , and which , though it may enrich the government , will not impoverish the people , except by destroying their health , and enervating their limbs .


The tax , my lords , even supposing it paid without any method of evasion , is so low , that in a quarter of a pint , the quantity which the lower people usually demand at once , it does not amount to any denomination of money  and so small an addition will be easily overbalanced by the sale of a larger quantity than formerly  for it can not be doubted but the practice which prevailed in opposition to the law , will grow yet more predominant by its encouragement  and that , therefore , the advantage of a large and quick sale , will lessen the price more than so slight a tax can possibly increase it .


The noble duke has endeavoured to reduce us to difficulties , by urging , that since the corruption of the people can not be greater , we ought willingly to agree to any law , of which the title declares that it is intended to produce a reformation , because the worst that can be feared is , that it may be without effect .


But , my lords , such is the enormous absurdity of this bill , that no plea can be offered for it with the least appearance of reason  and the greatest abilities , when they are exerted in its defence , are able only to show , by fruitless efforts , that it can not be vindicated .
If the state of the nation be really such as has been supposed , if the most detestable and odious vice has overspread the kingdom to its utmost limits , if the people are universally abandoned to drunkenness , sloth , and villany , what can be more absurd than to trifle with doubtful experiments , and to make laws which must be suspected of inefficacy ?
In the diseases of the state , as in those of the body , the force of the remedy ought to be proportioned to the strength and danger of the disease  and surely no political malady can be more formidable than the prevalence of wickedness , nor can any time require more firmness , vigilance , and activity , in the legislative power .


That the law , therefore , may be without effect , is , in the present state of corruption , if it has been truly represented , a sufficient reason for rejecting it , without allowing it to be committed  because there is now no time for indulgence , or for delays  a nation universally corrupt , must be speedily reformed , or speedily ruined .
Those habits which have been confessed to be already too powerful for the laws now in being , may in a short time be absolutely irresistible  and that licentiousness which intimidates the officers of justice , may in another year insult the legislature .


But , my lords , I am yet willing to hope that the noble duke 's account of the wickedness of the people , was rather a rhetorical exaggeration , uttered in the ardour of dispute , than a strict assertion of facts  and am of opinion that , though vice has , indeed , of late spread its contagion with great rapidity , there are yet great numbers uninfected , and can not believe that our condition is such as that nothing can make it more miserable .


In many parts of the country , my lords , these liquors have not yet been much used , nor is it likely that those who have never sold them , when the law allowed them , will begin an unnecessary trade , when it will expose them to penalties .
But a new law in favour of spirits will produce a general inclination , and a kind of emulation will incite every one to take a license for the retail of this new liquor  and so every part of the kingdom will be equally debauched , and no place will be without a vender of statutable poison .
The luxury of the vulgar , for luxury , in my opinion , it may very properly be called , will still increase , and vices and diseases will increase with it .


There is at least one part of the nation yet untainted , a part which deserves the utmost care of the legislature , and which must be endangered by a law like this before us .
The children , my lords , to whom the affairs of the present generation must be transferred , and by whom the nation must be continued , are surely no ignoble part of the publick .
They are yet innocent , and it is our province to take care that they may in time be virtuous  we ought , therefore , to remove from before them those examples that may infect , and those temptations that may corrupt them .
We ought to reform their parents , lest they should imitate them  and to destroy those provocatives to vice , by which the present generation has been intoxicated , lest they should with equal force operate upon the next .


There is , therefore , no occasion , my lords , for any farther deliberation upon this bill  which , if the nation be yet in any part untainted , will infect it  and if it be universally corrupted , will have no tendency to amend it  and which we ought , for these reasons to reject , that our abhorrence of vice may be publickly known , and that no part of the calamities which wickedness must produce , may be imputed to us .


Lord DELAWARE then spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , as I am entirely of opinion that a more accurate examination of this bill will evince its usefulness and propriety to many of the lords who are now most ardent in opposing it , I can not but think it necessary to consider it in a committee .


It is to be remembered , my lords , that this bill is intended for two purposes of very great importance to the publick  it is designed that the liberties of mankind shall be secured by the same provisions by which the vices of our own people are to be reclaimed , and supplies for carrying on the war shall be raised by a reformation of the manners of the people .


This , my lords , is surely a great and generous design  this is a complication of publick benefits , worthy the most exalted virtue , and the most refined policy  and though a bill in which views so distant are to be reconciled , should appear not to be absolutely perfect , it must yet be allowed to deserve regard  nor ought we to reject , without very cautious deliberation , any probable method of reforming the nation , or any easy way of raising supplies .


The encroachment of usurpation without , and the prevalence of vice within , is a conjunction of circumstances very dangerous  and to remove both by the same means , is an undertaking that surely can not deserve either censure or contempt : if it succeeds , it may demand the loudest acclamations  and if it fails , must be at least approved .


The use , my lords , of spirituous liquors , though in the excess now so frequently to be observed , undoubtedly detrimental to multitudes , is not , in a proper degree , either criminal or unwholesome  and , therefore , ought not to be prohibited by a tax so heavy as has been proposed by a noble lord , who , if he pursues his reasoning , must propose to tax in the same proportion every other liquor that can administer to vice .


It is , however , certain , that too much is wasted in riot and debauchery  and that , therefore , some addition to the price of this liquor ought to be made , that , though the use of it may be continued , the excess may be restrained .


What will be the effects of this bill , and whether either of these benefits are to be expected from it , can be known only by an impartial examination  and therefore it ought to be discussed with that accuracy which is peculiar to a committee .


Lord LONSDALE here got up again , and spoke to this purpose : -- My lords , that a bill which shall restrain the excess of drinking distilled liquors without hindering their moderate use , will deserve the applause of every lover of his country , I can not deny  but that any such bill can be contrived , may very justly be doubted  for in proportion to their price they will always be used , and nothing can hinder excess but a high tax , such as I have already proposed .


The bill now before us , my lords , will , indeed , by no means obstruct the moderate use , because it will give an unbounded license to the most luxurious excess  if , therefore , nothing more be intended in the committee , than to consider how far this bill will promote the reformation of the people , it is surely not necessary to engage in any farther inquiries .


It has appeared already , to those who do not obstinately shut their eyes , that there is in it no provision for the prevention of that abuse of spirits which universally prevails .
It has appeared , that the cheapness of licenses will not hinder the present retailers from carrying on an illegal trade  that information will not now be more safe or more frequent than before , and that the duty , if not in part evaded , may yet be probably abated from the present profits of the sale .


It has appeared , my lords , that no effect can be produced by this bill but the promotion of debauchery , the increase of drunkenness , the subversion of order , and the decay of industry  the miseries of disease , and the rage of want .


But that this bill will not produce , at least for some time , a large addition to the publick revenues , has not yet been proved  and while it is allowed that it will raise money , I do not wonder to hear it steadily defended , because nothing more is expected from it .
But as I have not yet conversed enough with statesmen to persuade myself that the government ought to be supported by means contrary to the end for which government is instituted , I am still convinced that this bill ought to be rejected with contempt , because it will lessen the wealth of the nation without any equivalent advantage , and will at once impoverish the people , and corrupt them .


Lord ISLAY then spoke to this effect : -- My lords , I can not but be of opinion that this debate has been carried on with a vehemence by no means necessary , and that the question has been perplexed by a mistaken zeal , that the effects of this bill have been exaggerated , perhaps , on both sides , and that the opinions which have been formed with relation to it , are not really so opposite as they appear .


Those who oppose the bill , think the duty upon spirits not so high as to hinder that debauchery which so much prevails among us  and those that vindicate it , declare that more violent restraints will not be borne .
Both parties have reason , and the vindicators of the bill have , likewise , experience on their side .


But , my lords , though severe restraints suddenly opposed to the habits and inclinations of the people , operating in their full force , may be broken through by restless struggles and obstinate resistance , yet a diminution of those gratifications will be borne which can not wholly be taken away , and the same laws , introduced by proper degrees , will be patiently obeyed  this , therefore , may be very properly considered as the first tax necessary to be laid , which , though it may produce no great effects in itself , may at least make way for a second that shall be more sensibly felt , till at length these fatal spirits shall be raised to a price at which few will be able , and none willing , to purchase one pleasure of drunkenness .


But it is not impossible that even this tax , with the other provisions in the bill , may produce the reformation which is unanimously desired  and as violence should never be used till gentle methods have been tried , this bill ought , in my opinion , to be passed , and , therefore , to be referred to a committee without farther debate  for it will be thought , both by our allies and our enemies , that a great part of this assembly is very indifferent about the success of the war , if we delay the supplies , by disputing in what manner they shall be raised .


[ The question being then put , whether the bill shall be committed , it was carried in the affirmative .
And the lords DELAWARE and HERVEY being appointed tellers , the numbers were , Contents 59 , Proxies 23 -- 82 .
Not contents 38 , Proxies 16 -- 54 .


It was remarked on this occasion , that there being ten prelates in the house , they all divided against the question  upon which the earl of CHESTERFIELD seeing them come towards him , said , he doubted if he had not mistaken the side , not having had the honour of their company for many years .


Two days after , the same bill was considered by the house of lords in a committee to which all of them were summoned , and occasioned another very important and curious debate . ]


FEBRUARY 23 , 1742-3 .


The title of the bill on spirituous liquors being read , was postponed : then the preamble was read , importing , `` that whereas great difficulties and inconveniencies had attended the putting the act 9 Geo .
II .
in execution , and the same had not been found effectual to answer the purposes intended , '' the commons being desirous to raise the necessary supplies in the easiest manner , do grant the rates on spirituous liquors , hereafter mentioned , and repeal the present rates .


Lord HERVEY spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , notwithstanding the specious arguments which were used to influence the house to permit this bill to escape the censure it deserved , and be admitted to a farther examination in a committee , I am still confident that nothing can justly be offered in its defence  and am not afraid to declare my opinion , that it is not approved even by those who vindicate it  of whom I can not but believe , from long experience of their judgment and their knowledge , that they consider it only as an easy manner of raising money , as an expedient rather necessary than eligible , and such as only the exigencies of the government could have prevailed upon them to propose  for nothing is more evident , than that it can not answer the purposes of the former bill .


This , however harsh it may appear , and however inconsistent with that delicacy with which the debates of this august assembly have generally been carried on , must surely be pardoned on this occasion , if for no other reason , at least for this , that it is not easy to forbear it , it is impossible wholly to suppress it in the mind  and to forbear to speak what can not but be thought , is no part of the duty of a publick counsellor .


The conduct of those whose station subjects them to the resentment of the ministry , or who may be reasonably imagined to expect favours from them , has , throughout all our deliberations on this bill , been such as evidently discovers their only care to be the imposition of a new tax , and the establishment of a new fund .
They do not seem to urge seriously any other argument than the necessity of raising money , or to oppose the objections that have been offered , for any other reason , than because they have a tendency to obstruct the supplies .


No other argument can , indeed , be urged in vindication of a bill which every principle of policy or justice must incite us to condemn  a bill by which the sense of morality and religion will be extinguished , and the restraints , of law made ineffectual  by which the labourer and manufacturer will be at once debilitated and corrupted , and by which the roads will be filled with thieves , and the streets with beggars .


It appears , my lords , from the papers on the table , that seven millions of gallons are every year distilled  and experience shows us , that the quality of the liquor is such , that a quarter of a pint is sufficient to intoxicate the brain .
Upon this computation , my lords , it is reasonable to believe , that a twentieth part of the labouring hands of this nation are detained from their proper occupations by this kind of drunkenness  and , consequently , that a twentieth part of the trade is every year lost , or , perhaps , a twentieth part of our people every year hurried to the grave , or disabled from contributing to the publick good .


These , my lords , are no doubtful facts , or conjectural calculations , they are confirmed by the most incontestable evidence , and established by all the demonstration of arithmetick  and therefore your lordships are in no danger of errour from either ignorance or uncertainty , but must determine , if you approve this bill , in opposition to all the powers of conviction , and must set aside testimony and reason at the same time .


These facts , my lords , are so plain , that the warmest advocates for the bill have tacitly acknowledged them , by proposing that , if it be found ineffectual , it shall be amended in the next session .
What effect this proposal may have upon others , I know not  but for my part , I shall never think it allowable to sport with the prosperity of the publick , or to try experiments by which , if they fail , the lives of thousands must be destroyed .


Such a scheme , my lords , very ill becomes those to whom their ancestors have transmitted the illustrious character of guardians of the people  for surely such cruelty was never practised by the utmost wantonness of tyranny , or the most savage rage of invasion .
No man ever before conceived the design of scattering poison for a certain period of time among the people , only to try what havock it would make .


What will be the effects of unrestrained and licensed debauchery may be known , without the guilt of so dreadful an experiment , only by observing the present conduct of the people , even while they are hindered from the full enjoyment of their pleasures , by the terrours of a penal law .
Whoever shall be so far touched with the interest of the publick , as to extend his inquiries to the lowest classes of the people , will find some diseased , and others vitiated  he will find some imprisoned by their creditors , and others starving their children  and if he traces all these calamities and crimes to their original cause , will find them all to proceed from the love of distilled liquors .


I know , my lords , that in answer to all these expostulations , and a thousand more , it will be urged by the ministers and their friends , that there is no other method to be found of raising the supplies , and that the demands of the government must be satisfied at whatever rate , and by whatever means .


Though I am very far from approving this assertion , I do not wonder at its prevalence among those who are enriched by every tax , and whose only claim to the preferments which they enjoy arises from their readiness to concur in every scheme for increasing the burdens of the publick  and , therefore , shall never expect their approbation of any proposal , by which a new tax may be retarded .
Yet I can not but declare that , in my opinion , we ought to suspend our proceedings , that the commons may discover what danger their negligence , precipitation , or blind compliance , has brought upon the nation  and that the people may , by so signal a proof of our disapprobation , be alarmed against any attempt of the same kind under any future administration .


This , my lords , will be considered , not only by posterity , but by all the wise and honest men of the present time , as a proof of our regard for virtue , and our attention to the publick welfare .
This conduct will be secretly approved , even by those who may think themselves obliged to oppose it in publick  and , as it will be moderate and decent , may probably preserve the nation without irritating the other house .


I therefore move , my lords , that instead of proceeding in the superfluous forms of a committee , we should resume the house , and endeavour to obtain farther information .


After a short silence , lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke to this effect : -- My lords , the observations which , though sufficiently explained and enforced in the late debate , the noble lord has been pleased to repeat on this occasion , are in themselves , indeed , sufficiently pertinent , and have been urged by his lordship with uncommon spirit and elegance  but he ought to have reflected , that general declamations are improper in a committee , where the particular clauses of the bill are to be separately considered .


I propose , therefore , that instead of wasting that time , of which the exigencies of the publick now require an uncommon frugality , in useless rhetorick , and untimely vehemence , we should proceed to examine in order the distinct paragraphs of this bill , by which it may more easily appear , whether it ought to be rejected or approved .


It can not , indeed , be proposed , that any of the clauses shall be amended in this committee  for the claims of the commons , and the obstinacy with which they have always adhered to them , on whatever they are founded , is well known .
I am old enough to remember the animosities which have arisen between the two houses , from attempts to adjust this part of their pretensions  animosities which at this time may be not only dangerous to ourselves , but fatal to a great part of mankind , and which it ought , therefore , to be our utmost care not to excite .


Lord AYLESFORD : -- My lords , though the consideration of the distinct paragraphs of the bill be , as the noble lord has very justly observed , the proper business of the committee  yet since , as he has likewise observed , the present state of our affairs requires unusual expedition , I think we may very properly spare ourselves the trouble of considering paragraphs which we can not amend  and which are in themselves so clear and so obvious , that they may be understood in their full extent upon a cursory perusal .


But , my lords , though I think it not proper to follow our usual method of considering the paragraphs distinctly , which can only drive the bill forward towards the third reading , as it has already been forced into the committee  yet I think it not necessary to irritate the other house , alarm our allies , or encourage our enemies , by rejecting that bill by which it is intended that the supplies shall be raised .
There is an easy and moderate method , by which the same end may be attained without any disturbance of the publick , any impediment of the schemes of the government , or any just offence to the commons .


Instead of passing or rejecting this bill , of which the first is absolutely criminal , and the second perhaps improper , let us only delay it , by which we shall give the commons time to reflect upon it , to reexamine it , and discover , what they , perhaps , have not hitherto suspected , its destructive tendency .
Nor can it be doubted , but the observations which will arise from the necessity of inquiring into the reasons of our conduct , will soon induce them to form another bill , not liable to the same objections  I , therefore , second the noble lord 's motion to resume the house .


Lord ISLAY : -- My lords , if we consider the pretensions of the commons , and the stubbornness with which they have hitherto adhered to them , we shall easily find the impropriety of the noble lord 's motion , and foresee the inefficacy of the methods which he so warmly recommends .


The alarm which he supposes us to give the commons by postponing the bill before us , the observations which they will make upon our conduct , the new informations which they will receive , and the new bill which they will send , are merely imaginary .
They will not consider themselves as concerned in the delay or expedition of our procedure , but will suppose us to act upon our own reasons , which it is not necessary for them to examine , and will by no means send another bill for supplies , till they are informed that this is rejected .


Thus , my lords , we shall only retard the supplies , without altering , or being able to alter , the method of raising them  and at last pass that bill , without examination , which we now neglect to examine , lest we should pass it  or , perhaps , irritate the commons by the novelty of our conduct , which , if they should resolve to consider it , they will probably consider only to censure .


Lord AYLESPORD : -- My lords , I am no stranger to the claims of the commons to the sole and independent right of forming money bills , nor to the heat with which that claim has been asserted , or the firmness with which it has always been maintained in late senates .
Nor am I ignorant , that by contesting this claim , we have sometimes excited disputes , which nothing but a prorogation of the senate could appease .


I know , my lords , and allow , that by acting in any unusual manner with regard to bills of this kind , we may excite the resentment of the commons , and that some interruption of the publick business may , for want of candour and moderation , possibly ensue .


But , my lords , I can not think the possibility of an ill consequence an argument sufficient to show the unreasonableness of my proposal  for the inconveniencies that may arise from postponing the bill , are only possible , but the calamities that we shall bring upon our country by passing it are certain .


But we are likewise to consider , my lords , that these events , of which it can only be said that they may happen , may also not happen .
When I reflect that the house of commons is an assembly of reasonable beings , that it is filled by the representatives of the British people , by men who will share the calamities of the publick , and whose interest it is , equally with ours , to prevent the destruction of our commerce , the decay of our manufactures , the corruption of the present age , and the ruin of posterity , I can not but hope that they will apply themselves to a candid review of the bill which they have sent , and without heat , jealousy , or disputes , explain it as they may do by another , which will be no deviation from the rules which they have established for themselves , and by which they may secure the happiness of their country without receding from their own pretensions .


The duke of BEDFORD : -- My lords , the proposal made by the noble lord appears to me so prudent and equitable , so moderate and so seasonable , and , in my opinion , suggests so easy a method of reconciling the pretensions of the commons with the necessity of amending the bill , that I can not but think it worthy of the unanimous approbation of your lordships .


I am very far from conceiving the commons to be an assembly of men deaf to reason , or imagining them so void of all regard for the happiness of the publick , as that they will sacrifice it to an obstinate adherence to claims which they can not but know to be in themselves disputable , and of which they must at least allow that they are only so far just as they contribute to the great end of government , the general good .


But lest they should , by any perverse and unseasonable obstinacy , attend more to the preservation of their own power than to the promotion of the happiness of their constituents , a method is now proposed , by which the errours of this bill may be corrected , without any concession of either house .
The commons may easily be informed of the dangers which are justly dreaded from this bill  and may , therefore , prepare another , by which a tax of the same kind may be laid , without a general license of drunkenness  or if a method of laying a duty upon these liquors , which may at once hinder their excessive use , and increase the revenue of the government , can not be discovered , they may raise the supplies for the year by some other scheme .


Lord CARTERET : -- My lords , as the expedient proposed by these noble lords , however it may be recommended , as being at once moderate and efficacious , has , in reality , no other tendency than to procure an absolute rejection of this bill , it is proper to consider the consequences which may be reasonably expected from the measures which they have hitherto proposed .


In order to the effectual restraint of the common people from the use of these pernicious liquors , they assert the necessity of imposing a very large duty to be paid by the distiller , which might , indeed , produce , in some degree , the effect which they expect from it , but would produce it by giving rise to innumerable frauds and inconveniencies .


The immediate consequence of a heavy duty would be the ruin of our distillery , which is now a very extensive and profitable trade , in which great multitudes are employed , who must instantly , upon the cessation of it , sink into poverty .
Our stills , my lords , not only supply our natives with liquors , which they used formerly to purchase from foreign countries , and therefore increase , or at least preserve the wealth of our country  but they likewise furnish large quantities for exportation to Guernsey , Jersey , and other places .
But no sooner will the duty proposed to be laid upon this liquor take place , than all this trade will be at an end , and those who now follow it will be reduced to support themselves by other employments  and those countries in which our spirits are now drank will be soon supplied from other nations with liquors at once cheaper and more pleasant .


It may be proposed , as an expedient for the preservation of our foreign trade , that the duty shall be repaid upon exportation  but the event of this provision , my lords , will be , that great quantities will be sent to sea for the sake of obtaining a repayment of the duty , which , instead of being sold to foreigners , will be privately landed again upon our own coasts .


Thus , my lords , will the duty be collected , and afterwards repaid  and the government will suffer the odium of imposing a severe tax , and incur the expense of employing a great number of officers , without any advantage to the publick .
Spirits will , in many parts of the kingdom , be very little dearer than at present , and drunkenness and debauchery will still prevail .


That these arts , and a thousand others , will be practised by the people to obtain this infatuating liquor , can not be doubted .
It can not be imagined that they will forbear frauds , who have had recourse to violence , or that those will not endeavour to elude the government , who have already defied it .


Every rigorous law will be either secretly evaded , or openly violated  every severe restraint will be shaken off , either by artifice or vice  nor can this vice , however dangerous or prevalent , be corrected but by slow degrees , by straitening the reins of government imperceptibly , and by superadding a second slight restraint , after the nation has been for some time habituated to the first .


That the government proceeds by these easy and gentle methods of reformation , ought not to be imputed to negligence , but necessity  for so far has the government been from any connivance at this vice , that an armed force was necessary to support the laws which were made to restrain it , and secure the chief persons of the state from the insults of the populace , whom they had only provoked by denying them this pernicious liquor .


Since , therefore , my lords , all opposition to this predominant inclination has appeared without effect , since the government evidently wants power to conquer the united and incessant struggles for the liberty of drunkenness , what remains but that this vice should produce some advantage to the publick , in return for the innumerable evils which arise from it , and that the government should snatch the first opportunity of taxing that vice which can not be reformed ?


This duty arises , indeed , from a concurrence of different causes , of just designs in the government , and of bad inclinations in the people .
The tax is just , and well meant  but it can be made sufficient to support the expenses to which it is appropriated , only by the resolution of the populace to continue , in some degree , their usual luxury .


I am far , my lords , from thinking this method of raising money eligible for its own sake , or justifiable by any other plea than that of necessity .
If it were possible at once to extinguish the thirst of spirits , no man who had any regard for virtue , or for happiness , would propose to augment the revenue by a tax upon them .


But , my lords , rigour has been already tried , and found to be vain  it has been found equally fruitless to forbid the people to use spirits , as to forbid a man in a dropsy to drink .
The force of appetite long indulged , and by indulgence made superiour to the control of reason , is not to be overcome at once  it can not be subdued by a single effort , but may be weakened  new habits of a more innocent kind may in time be superinduced , and one desire may counterbalance another .


We must endeavour , my lords , by just degrees , to withdraw their affections from this pernicious enjoyment , by making the attainment of it every year somewhat more difficult : but we must not quicken their wishes , and exasperate their resentment , by depriving them at once of their whole felicity .
By this method , my lords , I doubt not but we shall obtain what we have hitherto endeavoured with so little success  and I believe that though , in open defiance of a severe law , spirits are now sold in every street of this city , a gentle restraint will , in a short time , divert the minds of the people to other entertainments , and the vice of drinking spirits will be forgotten among us .


Lord HERVEY then rose up again , and spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , though I have always considered this bill as at once wicked and absurd , I imagined till now that the projectors of it would have been able to have argued , at least , speciously , though not solidly , in defence of it  nor did I imagine it to have been wholly indefensible , till I discovered how little the extensive knowledge , the long experience , and the penetrating foresight of the noble lord who spoke last , enabled him to produce in vindication of it .


His lordship 's argument is reducible to this single assertion , that the drinking distilled liquors can not be prevented  and from thence he drew this inference , that since it is a point of wisdom to turn misfortunes to advantage , we ought to contrive methods by which the debauchery of the people may enrich the government .


Though we should suppose the assertion true in any sense below that of absolute physical impossibility , the inference is by no means just  since it is the duty of governours to struggle against vice , and promote virtue with incessant assiduity , notwithstanding the difficulties that may for a time hinder the wisest and most rigorous measures from success .
That governour who desists from his endeavours of reformation , because they have been once baffled , in reality abandons his station and deserts his charge , nor deserves any other character than that of laziness , negligence , or cowardice .


The preservation of virtue where it subsists , and the recovery of it where it is lost , are the only valuable purposes of government .
Laws which do not promote these ends are useless , and those that obviate them are pernicious .
The government that takes advantage of wicked inclinations , by accident predominant in the people , and , for any temporary convenience , instead of leading them back to virtue , plunges them deeper into vice , is no longer a sacred institution , because it is no longer a benefit to society .
It is from that time a system of wickedness , in which bad ends are promoted by bad means , and one crime operates in subordination to another .


But , my lords , it is not necessary to show the unreasonableness of the inference , because the assertion from which it is deduced can not be proved .
That the excessive use of distilled liquors can not be prevented , is a very daring paradox , not only contrary to the experience of all past times , but of the present  for the law which is now to be repealed , did in a great degree produce the effects desired from it , till the execution of it was suspended , not by the inability of the magistrates , or obstinacy of the people , but by the artifice of ministers , who promoted the sale of spirits secretly , for the same reason which incites our present more daring politicians to establish the use of them by a law .


The defects of this law , for that it was defective can not be denied , were in the manner of levying the duty  for had half the duty that was demanded from the unlicensed retailers , been required from the distiller , there had been no need of informations  nor had we been stunned with the dismal accounts of the rage and cruelty of the people , or the violent deaths of those who endeavoured to grow rich by commencing prosecutions .
The duty had been regularly paid , the liquors had been made too dear for common use , and the name of spirits had been in a short time forgotten amongst us .


From this defect , my lords , arose all the difficulties and inconveniencies that have impeded the execution of the law , and prevented the effects that were expected from it , and by one amendment they might be all removed .


But instead of endeavouring to improve the efficacy of the remedy which was before proposed for this universal malady , we are now told , that it was too forcible to take effect , and that it only failed by the vigour of its operation .
We are informed , that the work of reformation ought not to be despatched with too much expedition , that mankind can not possibly be made virtuous at once , and that they must be drawn off from their habits by just degrees , without the violence of a sudden change .


What degrees the noble lord proposes to recommend , or what advantage he expects from allowing the people a longer time to confirm their habits , I am not able to discover .
He appears to me rather to propose an experiment than a law , and rather to intend the improvement of policy , than the safety of the people .


This experiment is , indeed , of a very daring kind , in which not only the money but the lives of the people are hazarded : their money has , indeed , in all ages been subject to the caprices of statesmen , but their lives ought to be exempt from such dangerous practices , because , when once lost , they can never be recovered .
By this bill , however , it is contrived to lay poison in the way of the people , poison which we know will be eagerly devoured by a fourth part of the nation , and will prove fatal to a great number of those that taste it  nor of this project is any defence made , but , that since the people love to swallow poison , it may be of advantage to the government to sell it .


It might not be improper , my lords , to publish to the people , by a formal proclamation , the benevolent intentions of their governours  and inform them , that licensed murderers are to be appointed , at whose shops they may infallibly be destroyed , without any danger of legal censures , provided they take care to use the poison prescribed by the government , and increase , by their death , the publick revenue .


That money only is desired from this bill , is not only obvious from the first perusal of it , but confessed even by those who defend it  but not one has continued to assert , that it will produce a reformation of manners , or recommended it otherwise than as an experiment .


For this reason , my lords , I still think my motion for postponing the bill very reasonable , nor do I make any scruple to confess that I propose , by postponing , only a more gentle and inoffensive method of dropping it , that some other way of raising the supplies may be attempted , or that the duty may be raised to three shillings a gallon  the lowest tax that can be laid with a design of reformation .


This method , my lords , or any other by which another bill may be procured , should be pursued  for whatever schemes the commons may substitute , the nation can suffer nothing by the change , they can not raise money in any other manner , but with less injury to the publick  since the greatest calamity which wrong measures can possibly produce , is the propagation of wickedness , and the establishment of debauchery .


Lord BATH then spoke , in substance as follows : -- My lords , that this bill is , with great propriety , called an experiment , I am ready to allow , but do not think the justness of that expression any forcible argument against it  because I know not any law that can be proposed for the same end , without equally deserving the same appellation .


All the schemes of government , my lords , have been perfected by slow degrees , and the defects of every regulation supplied by the wisdom of successive generations .
No man has yet been found , whose discernment , however penetrating , has enabled him to discover all the consequences of a new law , nor to perceive all the fallacies that it includes , or all the inconveniencies that it may produce  the first essay of a new regulation is , therefore , only an experiment made , in some degree , at random , and to be rectified by subsequent observations  in making which , the most prudent conduct is only to take care that it may produce no ill consequences of great importance , before there may be an opportunity of reviewing it .


This maxim , my lords , is , in my opinion , strictly regarded in the present attempt , which in itself is an affair of very great perplexity .
The health and virtue of the people are to be regarded on one part , and the continuance of a very gainful and extensive manufacture on the other  a manufacture by which only , or chiefly , the produce of our own nation is employed  and on which , therefore , the value of lands must very much depend .


Manufactures of this kind , my lords , ought never to be violently or suddenly suppressed .
If they are pernicious to the nation in general , they are , at least , useful to a very great part , and to some , who have no other employment , necessary  and in the design of putting a stop to any detrimental trade , care is always to be taken that the inconvenience exceed not the benefit , and time be allowed for those that are engaged in it to withdraw to some other business , and for the commodities that are consumed by it , to be introduced at some other market , or directed to some other use .


These cautions are in this bill very judiciously observed .
The trade , which all allow to administer supplies to debauchery , and fuel to diseases , will , by the provisions in this bill , sink away by degrees , and the health and virtue of the people will be preserved or restored without murmurs or commotions .


We must consider , likewise , my lords , the necessity of raising supplies , and the success with which they have hitherto been raised upon the scheme which is now under your consideration .


In examining the necessity of procuring supplies , I shall not expatiate upon the present danger of the liberties of all this part of the world  upon the distress of the house of Austria , the necessity of preserving the balance of power , or the apparent designs of the ancient and incessant disturbers of mankind , topicks which have been on former occasions sufficiently explained .


It is now only necessary to observe , that the state of our affairs requires expedition , and that a happy peace can only be expected from a successful war , and that war can only be made successful by vigour and despatch .


If by liberal grants of money , and ready concurrence in all necessary measures , we enable his majesty to raise a powerful army , there is no reason to doubt that a single campaign may procure peace , that it may establish the liberties of Europe , and raise our allies , who were so lately distressed , to their former greatness .


These supplies , my lords , which are so evidently necessary , may , by the method now proposed , be easily , speedily , and cheaply raised .
Upon the security which this act will afford , large sums are already offered to the government at the low interest of three for a hundred , by those who , if the conditions of the loan are changed , will , perhaps , demand four in a few days , or raise money by a combination to the rate of five or six for a hundred  of which I would not remark how much it will embarrass the publick measures , or how much it will encourage our enemies to an obstinate resistance .


Such , my lords , are the inconveniencies to be feared from rejecting this bill , or from postponing it  by which is plainly intended only a more gentle and tender manner of rejecting it , by hinting to the commons your disapprobation of it , and the necessity of sending up another , which you can not do without hazarding the peace of the nation and the fate of the war .


The commons , who are not obliged to inquire what reception their bills find here , may perhaps not immediately prepare another , but suffer time to elapse , till necessity shall oblige us to comply with those measures which we can not approve .


They may , likewise , by a kind of senatorial craft , elude all our precautions , and make the rejection of the bill ineffectual , as was once done , when a bill for a tax upon leather was rejected : the commons , determining not to be directed in the methods of raising money , sent up the same bill with only a small alteration of the title , to lay a duty upon tanned hides , which the lords were , for want of time , obliged to pass .


But , my lords , should the other house discover in this single instance , any uncommon degree of flexibility and complaisance , should they patiently endure the rejection of the bill , admit the validity of the reasons upon which your lordships have proceeded , and willingly engage in drawing up a new scheme for raising supplies  even upon this supposition , which is more favourable than can reasonably be formed , the business of the year will be very much perplexed , and the new bill hurried into a law without sufficient caution or deliberation .


The session is now , my lords , so far advanced , that many of the commons have retired into the country , whose advice and assistance may be necessary in the projection of a new money bill , so that the new bill must be formed in a short time , and by a thin house  and , indeed , the multiplicity of considerations necessary to another bill of this kind , is such , that I can not think it prudent to advise or undertake it .


The committee on ways and means must strike out another scheme for a considerable impost , which , in the present state of the nation , is in itself no easy task .
This scheme must be so adjusted as to be consistent with all the other taxes , which will require long consultations and accurate inquiries .
It must then struggle , perhaps , through an obstinate and artful opposition , before it can pass through the forms of the other house  and , when it comes before your lordships , may be again opposed with no less zeal than the bill before us , and perhaps , likewise , with equal reason .


All these dangers and difficulties will be avoided by trying , for a single year , the experiment which is now proposed  and which , if that should fail , may be better adjusted in the time of leisure , which the beginning of the next session will undoubtedly afford  before which time I am afraid no amendment can possibly be made .


It has been proposed , indeed , by the noble lord , that three shillings should be laid upon every gallon of distilled liquors , which would undoubtedly lessen the consumption , but would at the same time destroy the trade  a trade from which large profits may be in time gained  since our distillers have now acquired such skill , that the most delicate palate can not distinguish their liquors from those which foreigners import .


If the duty be raised to the height proposed , it must be allowed to be repaid for all that shall be exported  otherwise foreign nations will deprive us of this part of our trade  and it has been already shown , that by mock exportations the duty may be frequently evaded .


Thus , my lords , there will be difficulties on either hand  if a duty so high be paid , the manufacturer will be ruined  if it be evaded , the consumption will be lessened .


One inconvenience will easily be discovered to be the necessary consequence of any considerable advance of the price .
We may be certain that an act of the senate will not moderate the passions , or alter the appetites of the people  and that they will not be less desirous of their usual gratifications , because they are denied them .
The poor may , indeed , yield to necessity , unless they find themselves able to resist the law , or to evade it  but those who can afford to please their taste , or exalt their spirits at a greater expense , will still riot as before , but with this difference , that their excesses will produce no advantage to the publick .


If an additional duty of three shillings be laid upon every gallon of distilled liquors , the product of our own distillery will be dearer than those liquors which are imported from foreign parts  and , therefore , it can not but be expected that the money which now circulates amongst us , will in a short time be clandestinely carried into other countries .


Such , my lords , will be the effect of those taxes which are so strongly recommended  and , therefore , they ought not to be imposed till all other methods of proceeding have been found ineffectual .


It is possible , indeed , that the regulation specified in this bill may not produce any beneficial effect , and that the present practice of debauchery may still continue among the people  but it is likewise possible that this tax may , by increasing the price , augment the revenue at the same time that it lessens the consumption .


This proposal has , by some lords , been treated as a paradox  but they certainly suspected it of falsehood , only for want of patience to form the calculations necessary in such disquisitions .
The tax of the last year amounted to one hundred and seventy thousand pounds  this tax is now doubled , so that the same quantity will produce three hundred and forty thousand  but if one third less should be consumed , the present tax will amount to no more than two hundred and twenty thousand pounds  and when fifty thousand licenses are added , the revenue will gain an hundred thousand pounds , though one third part of the consumption should be hindered .


But , my lords , supposing no part of the consumption hindered , I can not think that bill should be rejected , which , in a time of danger like the present , shall add to the publick revenue an annual income of more than two hundred thousand pounds , without lessening any manufacture , without burdening any useful or virtuous part of the nation , and without giving the least occasion to any murmurs among the people .


It is to be remembered , my lords , that whatever corruption shall prevail amongst us , it can not be imputed to this bill , which did not make , but find the nation vitiated , and only turned their vices to publick advantage  so that if it produces any diminution of the sale of spirits , it is indisputably to be applauded as promoting virtue .
If the sale of spirits still continues the same , it will deserve some degree of commendation , as it will , at least , not contribute to the increase of vice , and as it will augment the revenue without injuring the people  for how , my lords , can we be censured for only suffering the nation to continue in its former state ?


Lord TALBOT then spoke in substance as follows : -- My lords , if we consider the tendency of the argument used by the noble lord , the only argument on which he appears to lay any stress , it will prove , if it proves any thing , what can not be admitted by your lordships , without bidding farewell to independency , and acknowledging that you are only the substitutes of a higher power .


It appears by the tenor of his reasoning , that he considers this house as only obliged , in questions relating to supplies , to ratify the determinations of the other  to submit implicitly to their dictates , and receive their sovereign commands , without daring either to refuse compliance , or delay it .


If we conjoin the reasoning of the noble lord who spoke last , with that of one who spoke before in favour of the bill , we shall be able to discover the full extent of our power on these occasions  the first was pleased to inform us , that though we were at liberty to examine the paragraphs of this bill , we had no right , at least no power to amend them  because in money bills , the commons left us no other choice than that of passing or rejecting them .


This , my lords , might have been thought a sufficient contraction of those privileges which your ancestors transmitted to you , and the commons needed to have desired no farther concessions from this assembly , since this was a publick confession of a subordinate state , and admitted either that part of our ancient rights had been given up , or that we were at present too much depressed to dare to assert them .


We might , however , still comfort ourselves with the peaceful and uncontested possession of the alternative  we might still believe that what we could not approve we might reject , without irritating the formidable commons .
But now , my lords , a new doctrine has been vented among us  we are told not only that we must not amend a money bill , but that it will be to no purpose to reject it  for that the other house will send it again without altering any thing but the title , and force it upon us , when there is no time for any other expedient .


If this , my lords , should be done , I know not how the bill might , at its second appearance , be received by other lords  for my part , I should vote immediately for rejecting it , without any alleviating or mollifying expedients .
I should reject it , my lords , even on the last day of the session , without any regard to the pretended necessity of raising supplies , and without suffering myself to be terrified into compliance by the danger of the house of Austria  for though I think the balance of power on the continent necessary to be preserved at the hazard of a fleet or an army , I can not think it of equal importance to us with the equipoise of our own government  nor can I conceive it my duty to enslave myself to secure the freedom of another .


The danger , therefore , of disgusting the commons , at this or any other juncture , shall never influence me to a tame resignation of the privileges of our own house  nor shall I willingly allow any force to arguments which are intended only to operate upon our fear  and , therefore , unless there shall appear some better plea in favour of this bill , I shall think it my duty to oppose it .


The other plea is the difficulty , or , in the style of the noble lord who spoke last , the impossibility of raising supplies by any other method .
That it is not easy to raise supplies by any new tax , in a nation where almost all the necessaries of life are loaded with imposts , must be readily allowed  but that it is impossible , the folly of the people , which is at least equal to their poverty , will not suffer me to grant .


One other expedient , at least , has been already discovered by the wonderful sagacity of our new ministers  an expedient which they can not , indeed , claim the honour of inventing , but which appears so conformable to the rest of their conduct , and so agreeable to their principles , that I doubt not but they will very often practise it , if the continuance of their power be long enough to admit of a full display of their abilities .


Amidst their tenderness for our manufactures , and their regard for commerce , they have established a lottery for eight hundred thousand pounds , by which they not only take advantage of an inclination too predominant , an inclination to grow rich rather by a lucky hazard , than successful industry  but give up the people a prey to stockjobbers , usurers , and brokers of tickets , who will plunder them without mercy , by the encouragement of those by whom it might be hoped that they would be protected from plunderers .


All lotteries , my lords , are games , which are not more honest or more useful for being legal  and the objection which has been made to all other games , and which has never yet been answered , will be found equally valid when applied to them .
They engross that attention which might be employed in improving or extending our manufactures  they swallow that money which might circulate in useful trade  they give the idle and the diligent an equal prospect of riches  and by conferring unexpected wealth upon those who never deserved it , and know not how to use it , they promote extravagance and luxury , insolence and dissoluteness .


But these consequences , my lords , and a thousand others equally important , equally formidable , may be objected without effect , against any scheme by which money will be raised  money !
the only end at which our ministers have aimed for almost half a century  money !
by which only they have preserved the favour of the court , and the obedience of the senate  money !
which has supplied the place of wisdom at one time , and of courage at another .


To gain money , my lords , they have injured trade by establishing a lottery  and they are now about to sacrifice the health and virtue of the people , to the preservation of a trade by which money may be furnished to the government .
This , my lords , is their only design , however they may act , or whatever they may profess  if they endeavour to protect either the trade or lives of people , it is only because they expect a continuance of taxes from them  and when more desperate measures are necessary for the same purposes , they ruin their trade by one project , and destroy their lives by another .


Lord LONSDALE next spoke , to this effect : -- My lords , it is not without the utmost grief and indignation , that I find this house considered by some who have spoken in vindication of this bill , as obliged to comply with any proposals sent up by the commons for raising money , however destructive to the publick , or however contrary to the dictates of our conscience , or convictions of our reason .


What is this , my lords , but once more to vote ourselves useless ?
What but to be the first that shall destroy the constitution of the government , and give up that liberty which our ancestors established ?


That this is really the design of any of the noble lords , who have spoken in vindication of the bill , and have asserted the necessity of passing it , without any attempts to amend it , I am very far from affirming  but certainly , my lords , this , and this only , is the consequence of their positions , with whatever intention they may have advanced them  for how , my lords , can we call ourselves independent , if we are to receive the commands of the other house ?
or with what propriety can we assume the title of legislators , if we are to pass a bill like this without examination ?


The bill now before us , my lords , is of the utmost importance to the happiness of that nation whose welfare we have hitherto been imagined to superintend .
In this bill are involved not only the trade and riches , but the lives and morals of the British people  nor can we suffer it to pass unexamined , without betraying the nation to wickedness and destruction .


Should we , on this occasion , suffer ourselves to be degraded from legislators to messengers from the commons to the throne  should we be content only to transmit the laws which we ought to amend , and resign ourselves up implicitly to the wisdom of those whom we have formerly considered as our inferiours , I know not for what purpose we sit here .
It would be my counsel that we should no longer attempt to preserve the appearance of power , when we have lost the substance , or submit to share the drudgery of government , without partaking of the authority .


The time of such desperation is , indeed , not yet arrived  but every act of servile compliance will bring it nearer  and , therefore , my lords , for the sake of ourselves , as well as of the people , I join the noble lord 's motion for resuming the house , that farther information may be obtained both by ourselves , by the commons , and by the nation .


The duke of NEWCASTLE then rose , and spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , I believe no lord in this assembly is more zealous for the advantage of the publick than myself , or more desirous to preserve the lives , or amend the morals of the people  but I can not think that this character can justly imply any dislike of the bill now before us .


If I should admit what the noble lord has asserted , that the lives and morals of the people are affected by this bill , I can not yet see that his inference is just , or that our compliance with the motion is , therefore , necessary .


That under the present regulation , the miseries of the nation are every day increased  that corruption spreads every day wider , and debauchery makes greater havock , is confessed on all sides  and , therefore , I can discover no reason for continuing the laws in their present state , nor can think that we ought to decline any experiment by which that disorder , which can not be increased , may possibly be lessened .


It is confessed by the noble lords , who declare their approbation of the motion for postponing the consideration of this bill , that they intend nothing less than a gentle and tacit manner of dropping it , by showing the commons that though to avoid offence they do not absolutely reject it , yet they can not approve it , and will not pass it  and that , therefore , the necessity of raising supplies , requires that another bill should be formed , not liable to the same objections .


The consequence of this procedure , my lords , can only be , that either the commons will form another bill for raising money , or that they will send up this again with a new title , and such slight alterations as not the happiness of the nation , but the forms of the senate demand .


If , in return for our endeavours to reform a bill , of which they think themselves the only constitutional judges , they should send it again with only another title  what , my lords , shall we procure by the delay , but a new occasion of murmurs and discontent , a new confirmation of the power of the commons , and an establishment of senatorial chicanery , at once pernicious to the publick , and ignominious to ourselves .


That the commons , in sending back a bill that has been rejected in this house , with only a change in the title , act contrary to the end of senatorial consultations , though consistently with their external forms , can not be denied : but as each house is without any dependence on the other , such deviations from the principles of our constitution , however injurious to our authority , or however detrimental to the nation , can not be punished , nor otherwise prevented , than by caution and prudence .


If , therefore , the commons , as they have formerly done , should return the bill without alteration , we shall only have impaired our own authority , and shaken the foundations of our government by a fruitless opposition .
Nor shall we gain any advantage , though they should comply with our expectations , and employ the little time that remains in contriving a new tax  for corruption must then proceed without opposition , the people must grow every day more vitious , and debauchery will , in a short time , grow too general to be suppressed .


With regard to the bill before us , the only question that is necessary or proper , is , whether it will promote or hinder the consumption of distilled liquors ?
for as to the effects of those liquors , those that vindicate , and that oppose this bill , are of the same opinion  and all will readily allow , that if the law now proposed shall be found to increase the consumption which it was intended to diminish , it ought immediately to be repealed , as destructive to the people , and contrary to the end for which it was designed  but if the additional duties shall produce any degree of restraint , if they shall hinder the consumption even of a very small part , I think it must be allowed that the provisions are just and useful  since it has already appeared , that this vice is too deeply rooted to be torn up at once  and that , therefore , it is to be pruned away by imperceptible diminution .


Whether the provisions now offered in the bill might not admit of improvements  whether some other more efficacious expedients might not be discovered  and whether the duties might not be raised yet higher , with more advantage to the publick , may undoubtedly admit of long disputes and deep inquiries  but for these inquiries and disputes , my lords , there is at present no time : the affairs of the continent require our immediate interposition , the general oppressors of the western world are now endeavouring to extend their dominions , and exalt their power beyond the possibility of future opposition  and our allies , who were straggling against them , can no longer continue their efforts without assistance .


At a time like this , my lords , it is not proper to delay the supplies by needless controversies  or , indeed , by any disputes which may , without great inconvenience , be delayed to a time of tranquillity , a time when all our inquiries may be prosecuted at leisure , when every argument may be considered in its full extent , and when the improvement of our laws ought , indeed , to be our principal care .
At present it appears to me , that every method of raising money , without manifest injury to the morals of the people , deserves our approbation  and , therefore , that we ought to pass this bill , though it should not much hinder the consumption of spirituous liquors , if it shall barely appear that it will not increase it .


It is at least proper , that , at this pressing exigence , those that oppose the bills by which supplies are to be raised , should , by offering other expedients , show that their opposition proceeds not from any private malevolence to the ministry , or any prepossession against the publick measures , but from a steady adherence to just principles , and an impartial regard for the publick good  for it may be suspected , that he who only busies himself in pulling down , without any attempts to repair the breaches that he has made , with more fit or durable materials , has no real design of strengthening the fortification .


It has been proposed , indeed , by one of the noble lords , that a tax of three shillings a gallon should be laid upon all distilled spirits , and collected by the laws of excise at the still-head , which would doubtless secure a great part of the people from the temptations to which they are at present exposed , but would at the same time produce another effect not equally to be desired .


I have been informed , my lords , upon mentioning this proposal in conversation , that such duties will raise the price of the liquors distilled among us above that of foreign countries  and that , therefore , not only all our foreign trade of this kind would be immediately destroyed , but that many of those who now drink our own spirits , only because they are cheaper , will then purchase those of foreign countries , which are generally allowed to be more pleasant .


That this is really the state of the affair , I do not affirm  for I now relate only what I have heard from others  but surely the imposition of so heavy a duty requires a long consideration  nor can it be improper to mention any objections , the discussion of which may contribute to our information .


But any other regulations than those now offered , will require so many inquiries , and so long consultation , that the senate will expect to be dismissed from their attendance , before any resolutions are formed  and when once the supplies are provided , we shall find ourselves obliged to leave the law relating to spirituous liquors in its present state .


Then , my lords , will the enemies of the government imagine that they have a new opportunity of gratifying their malignity , by censuring us as wholly negligent of the publick happiness , and charge us with looking without concern upon the debauchery , the diseases , and the poverty of the people , without any compassion of their wants , or care of their reformation .


That to continue the present law any longer , will be only to amuse ourselves with ineffectual provisions , is universally allowed  nor is there any difference of opinion with regard to the present state of the vice which we are now endeavouring to hinder .
The last law was well intended , but was dictated by anger , and ratified by zeal  and therefore was too violent to be executed , and , instead of reforming , exasperated the nation .


No sooner , therefore , did the magistrates discover the inflexible resolution of the people , their furious persecution of informers , and their declared hatred of all those who concurred in depriving them of this dangerous pleasure , than they were induced , by regard to their own safety , to relax that severity which was enjoined , and were contented to purchase safety by gratifying , or , at least , by not opposing those passions of the multitude , which they could not hope to control  the practice of drinking spirits continued , and the consumption was every year greater than the former .


This , my lords , is the present state of the nation  a state sufficiently deplorable , and which all the laws of humanity and justice command us to alter .
This is the universal declaration .
We all agree , that the people grow every day more corrupt , and that this corruption ought to be stopped  but by what means is yet undecided .


Violent methods and extremity of rigour have been already tried , and totally defeated  it is , therefore , proposed to try more easy and gentle regulations , that shall produce , by slow degrees , the reformation which can not be effected by open force  these new regulations appear to many lords not sufficiently coercive , and are imagined still less likely to reform a vice so inveterate , and so firmly established .


These opinions I can not flatter myself with the hope of reconciling  but must yet observe , that the consumption of these liquors , as of all other commodities , can only be lessened by proper duties , and that every additional imposition has a tendency to lessen them  and since , so far as it extends , it can produce no ill effects , deserves the approbation of those who sincerely desire to suppress this odious vice that has so much prevailed , and been so widely diffused .


It is , indeed , possible , that the duties now proposed may be found not sufficient  but for this defect there is an easy remedy .
The duty , if it be found , by the experience of a single year , to be too small , may , in the next , be easily augmented , and swelled , by annual increases , even to the height which is now proposed , if no remedy more easy can be found .


It may be objected , that this fund will be mortgaged for the payment of the sums employed in the service of the war  and that , therefore , the state of the duty can not afterwards be altered without injustice to the publick creditors , and a manifest violation of the faith of the senate  but , my lords , though in the hurry of providing for a pressing and important war , the commons could not find any other method so easy of raising money , it can not be doubted but that when they consider the state of the nation at leisure , they will easily redeem this tax , if it shall appear inconvenient , and substitute some other , less injurious to the happiness of the publick .


It was not impossible for them to have done this in the beginning of this session  nor can it be supposed , that men so long versed in publick affairs , could not easily have proposed many other imposts  but it may be imagined , that they chose this out of many , without suspecting that it would be opposed  and believed , that they were at once raising supplies , and protecting the virtue of the people .


Nor , indeed , my lords , does it yet appear that they have been mistaken  for though the arguments of the noble lords who oppose the bill are acute and plausible , yet since they agree that the consumption of these liquors is , at last , to be hindered by raising their price , it is reasonable to conceive , that every augmentation of the price must produce a proportionate diminution of the consumption  and that , therefore , this duty will contribute , in some degree , to the reformation of the people .
It seems , at least , in the highest degree probable , that it can not increase the evil which it is intended to remedy  and that , therefore , we may reasonably concur in it , as it will furnish the government with supplies , without any inconvenience to those that pay them .


The bishop of OXFORD next spoke to this effect : -- My lords , this subject has already been so acutely considered , and so copiously discussed , that I rise up in despair of proposing any thing new , of explaining any argument more clearly , or urging it more forcibly , of starting any other subject of consideration , or pointing out any circumstance yet untouched in those that have been proposed .


Yet , my lords , though I can not hope to add any thing to the knowledge which your lordships have already obtained of the subject in debate , I think it my duty to add one voice to the truth , and to declare , that in the balance of my understanding , the arguments against the bill very much outweigh those that have been offered in its favour .


It is always presumed by those who vindicate it , that every augmentation of the price will necessarily produce a proportionate decrease of the consumption .
This , my lords , is the chief , if not the only argument that has been advanced , except that which is drawn from the necessity of raising supplies , and the danger of disgusting the other house .
But this argument , my lords , is evidently fallacious  and therefore the bill , if it passes , must pass without a single reason , except immediate convenience .


Let us examine , my lords , this potent argument , which has been successively urged by all who have endeavoured to vindicate the bill , and echoed from one to another with all the confidence of irrefragability  let us consider on what suppositions it is founded , and we shall soon find how easily it will be dissipated .


It is supposed , by this argument , that every drinker of these liquors spends as much as he can possibly procure  and that therefore the least additional price must place part of his pleasure beyond his reach .
This , my lords , can not be generally true  it is perhaps generally , if not universally false .
It can not be doubted , but that many of those who corrupt their minds and bodies with these pernicious draughts , are above the necessity of constraining their appetites to escape so small an expense as that which is now to be imposed upon them  and even of those whose poverty can sink no lower , who are in reality exhausted by every day 's debauch , it is at least as likely that they will insist upon more pay for their work , or that they will steal with more rapacity , as that they will suffer themselves to be debarred from the pleasures of drunkenness .


It is not certain that this duty will make these liquors dearer to those who drink them  since the distiller will more willingly deduct from his present profit the small tax that is now proposed , than suffer the trade to sink  and even if that tax should be , as is usual , levied upon the retailer , it has been already observed , that , in the quantities necessary to drunkenness , it will not be perceptible .


But , my lords , though this argument appears thus weak upon the first and slightest consideration , the chief fallacy is still behind .
Those , who have already initiated themselves in debauchery , deserve not the chief consideration of this assembly  they are , for the greatest part , hopeless and abandoned , and can only be withheld by force from complying with those desires to which they are habitually enslaved .
They may , indeed , be sometimes punished , and at other times restrained , but can not often be reformed .


Those , my lords , who are yet uncorrupted , ought first to engage our care  virtue is easily preserved , but difficultly regained .
But for those what regard has hitherto been shown ?
What effect can be expected from this bill , but that of exposing them to temptations , by placing unlawful pleasures in their view ?
pleasures , which , however unworthy of human nature , are seldom forsaken after they have once been tasted .


In the consideration of the present question , it is to be remembered , that multitudes are already corrupted , and the contagion grows more dangerous in proportion as greater numbers are infected .


To stop the progress of this pestilence , my lords , ought to be the governing passion of our minds  to this point ought all our aims to be directed , and for this end ought all our projects to be calculated .


But how , my lords , is this purpose promoted by a law which gives a license , an unlimited and cheap license , for the sale of that liquor , to which , even those who support the bill impute the present corruption of the people ?
This surely is no rational scheme of reformation , nor can it be imagined , that a favourite and inveterate vice is to be extirpated by such gentle methods .


Let us consider , my lords , more nearly the effects of this new-invented regulation , and we shall see how we may expect from them the recovery of publick virtue .
A law is now to be repealed , by which the use of distilled liquors is prohibited , but which has not been for some time put in execution , or not with vigour sufficient to surmount the difficulties and inconveniencies by which its operation was obstructed .
The law is , however , yet in force , and whoever sells spirits must now sell them at the hazard of prosecution and penalties , and with an implicit confidence in the kindness and fidelity of the purchaser .


It can not be supposed , my lords , but that a law like this must have some effect .
It can not be doubted that some are honest and others timorous  and that among the wretches who are most to be suspected of this kind of debauchery , there are some in whom it is not safe to confide  they , therefore , must sometimes be hindered from destroying their reason by other restraints than want of money  and , when they are trusted with the secret of an illegal trade , must pay a dearer rate for the danger that is incurred .


But when this law is repealed , and every street and alley has a shop licensed to distribute this delicious poison , what can we expect ?
The most sanguine advocate for the bill can not surely hope , that any of those who now drink spirits will refrain from them , only because they are sold without danger  and though what can not be proved , or even hoped , should be admitted , that some must content themselves with a smaller quantity on account of the advanced price , yet while they take all opportunities of debauchery , while they spend , in this destructive liquor , all that either honest labour or daring theft will supply , they must always be examples of intemperance  such examples as , from the experience of late years , we have reason to believe will find many imitators  and therefore will promote at once the consumption of spirits , and the corruption of the people .


There is always to be found in wickedness a detestable ambition of gaining proselytes : every man who has suffered himself to be corrupted , is desirous to hide himself from infamy in crowds as vitious as himself , or desires companions in wickedness from the same natural inclination to society , which prompts almost every man to avoid singularity on other occasions .


Whatever be the reason , it may be every day observed , that the great pleasure of the vitious is to vitiate others  nor is it possible to squander an hour in the assemblies of debauchees of any rank , without observing with what importunity innocence is attacked , and how many arts of sophistry and ridicule are used to weaken the influence of virtue , and suppress the struggles of conscience .


The fatal art by which virtue is most commonly overborne is the frequent repetition of temptations , which , though often rejected , will at some unhappy moment generally prevail , and , therefore , ought to be removed  but which this bill is intended to place always in sight .


To what purpose will it be , my lords , to deprive nine hardened profligates of a tenth part of the liquor which they now drink , which is the utmost that this duty will effect ?
If they have an opportunity of corrupting one by their solicitation and example , the difference between nine and ten acts of debauchery is of very small importance to mankind , or even to the persons who are thus restrained , since their forbearance of the utmost excesses is only the effect of their poverty , not of their virtue .


How far is such restraint from being equivalent to the corruption of one mind , yet pure and undebauched !
to the seduction of one heart from virtue , and a new addition to the interest and prevalence of wickedness !
If it be necessary that the supplies should be raised for the government by the use of this pernicious liquor , it is desirable that it should be confined to few , and that it should rather be swallowed in large quantities by hopeless drunkards , than offered everywhere to the taste of innocence and youth , in licensed houses of wickedness .


The consumption will , for a time , be the same in both cases , but with this important difference , that wickedness would only be continued , not promoted  and as the poison would rid the land by degrees of the present race of profligates , it might be hoped , that our posterity would be uninfected .


But under the present scheme of regulations , my lords , vice will be propagated under the countenance of the legislature  and that kind of wickedness by which the nation is so infatuated that it has increased yearly , in opposition to a penal law , will now not only be suffered , but encouraged , and enjoy not impunity only , but protection .


Thus , if we pass the bill , we shall not even be able to boast the petty merit of leaving the nation in its present state  we shall take away the present restraints of vice , without substituting any in their place  we shall , perhaps , deprive a few hardened drunkards of a small part of the liquor which they now swallow , but shall open , according to the expectation of the noble lord , fifty thousand houses of licensed debauchery for the ruin of millions yet untainted .


To leave the nation in its present state , which is allowed on all hands to be a state of corruption , seems to be the utmost ambition of one of the noble lords , who has pleaded with the greatest warmth for this bill  for he concluded , with an air of triumph , by asking , how we can be censured for only suffering the nation to continue in its former state ?


We may be , in my opinion , my lords , censured as traitors to our trust , and enemies to our country , if we permit any vice to prevail , when it is in our power to suppress it .
We may be cursed , with justice , by posterity , as the abettors of that debauchery by which poverty and disease shall be entailed upon them , contemned in the present as the flatterers of those appetites which we ought to regulate , and insulted by that populace whom we dare not oppose .


Had none of our predecessors endeavoured the reformation of the people , had they contented themselves always to leave the nation as they found it , there had been long ago an end of all the order and security of society  for the natural depravity of human nature has always a tendency from less to greater evil  and the same causes which had made us thus wicked , will , if not obviated , make us worse .


Since the noble lord thinks it not necessary to attempt the reformation of the people , he might have spared the elaborate calculation by which he has proved , that a large sum wilt be gained by the government , though one third part of the consumption be prevented  for it is of very little importance to discuss the consequences of an event which will never happen .
He should first have proved , that a third part of the consumption will in reality be prevented , and then he might very properly have consoled the ministry , by showing how much they would gain from the residue .


That this bill , as it now stands , will produce a large revenue to the government , but no reformation in the people , is asserted by those that oppose , and undoubtedly believed by those that defend it  but as this is not the purpose which I am most desirous of promoting , I can not but think it my duty to agree to the proposal of the noble lord , that by postponing the consideration of the bill , more exact information may be obtained by us , and the commons may be alarmed at the danger into which the nation has been brought by their precipitation .


Lord BATH then rose again , and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , as the noble lord who has just spoken appears to have misapprehended some of my assertions , I think it necessary to rise again , that I may explain with sufficient clearness what , perhaps , I before expressed obscurely , amidst the number of different considerations that crowded my imagination .


With regard to the diminution that might be expected from this law , I did not absolutely assert , at least , I did not intend to assert , that a third part would be taken off  but only advanced that supposition as the basis of a calculation , by which I might prove what many lords appeared to doubt , that the consumption might possibly be diminished , and yet the revenue increased .


Upon this supposition , which must be allowed to be reasonable , both the purposes of the bill will be answered , and the publick supplies will be raised by the suppression of vice .


The diminution of the consumption may be greater or less than I have supposed .
If it be greater , the revenue will be , indeed , less augmented  but the purposes which , in the opinion of the noble lords who oppose the bill , are more to be regarded , will be better promoted , and all their arguments against it will be , at least , defeated  nor will the ministry , I hope , regret the failure of a tax which is deficient only by the sobriety of the nation .


If the diminution be less than I have supposed , yet if there be any diminution , it can not be said that the bill has been wholly without effect , or that the ministry have not proceeded either with more judgment or better fortune than their predecessors , or that they have not , at least , taken advantage of the errours that have been committed .
It must be owned , that they have either reformed the nation , or at least pointed out the way by which the reformation that has been so long desired , may be effected .


That this tax will in some degree hinder drunkenness , it is reasonable to expect , because it can only be hindered by taxing the liquors which are used in excess  but there yet remain , concerning the weight of the tax that ought to be laid upon them , doubts which nothing but experience can , I believe , remove .


By experience , my lords , we have been already taught , that taxes may be so heavy as to be without effect  that restraint may be so violent as to produce impatience  and , therefore , it is proper in the next essay to proceed by slow degrees and gentle methods , and produce that effect imperceptibly which we find ourselves unable to accomplish at once .


I can not therefore think , that the duty of three shillings a gallon can be imposed without defeating our own design , and compelling the people to find out some method of eluding the law like that which was practised after the act , by which in the second year of his present majesty , five shillings were imposed upon every gallon of compound waters  after which it is well known , that the distillers sold a simple spirit under the contemptuous title of senatorial brandy , and the law being universally evaded , was soon after repealed as useless .


Such , my lords , or worse , will be the consequence of the tax which the noble lord has proposed  for if it can not be evaded , spirits will be brought from nations that have been wiser than to burden their own commodities with such insupportable impost , and the empire will soon be impoverished by the exportation of its money .


Lord HERVEY answered , in substance as follows : -- My lords , I am very far from thinking the arguments of the noble lord such as can influence men desirous to promote the real and durable happiness of their country  for he is solicitous only about the prosperity of the British manufactures , and the preservation of the British trade , but has shown very little regard to British virtue .


That part of his argument is , therefore , not necessary to be answered , if the suggestion upon which it is founded were true , since it will be sufficient to compare the advantage of the two schemes .
And with regard to his insinuation , that senatorial brandy may be revived by a high duty , I believe , first , that , no such evasion can be contrived , and in the next place am confident , that it may be defeated by burdening the new-invented liquor , whatever it be , if it be equally pernicious , with an equal tax .
The path of our duty , my lords , is plain and easy , and only represented difficult by those who are inclined to deviate from it .


Lord BATHURST spoke next , to the effect following : -- My lords , whatever measures may be practised by the people for eluding the purposes of the bill now before us , with whatever industry they may invent new kinds of senatorial brandy , or by whatever artifices they may escape the diligence of the officers employed to collect a duty levied upon their vices and their pleasures , there is , at least , no danger that they will purchase from the continent those liquors which we are endeavouring to withhold from them , or that this bill will impoverish our country by promoting a trade contrary to its interest .


What would be the consequence of the duty of three shillings a gallon , proposed by the noble lord , it is easy to judge .
What , my lords , can be expected from it , but that it will either oblige or encourage the venders of spirits to procure from other places what they can no longer buy for reasonable prices at home ?
and that those drunkards who can not or will not suddenly change their customs , will purchase from abroad the pleasures which we withhold from them , and the wealth of the nation be daily diminished , but the virtue little increased ?


Thus , my lords , shall we at once destroy our own manufacture and promote that of our neighbours .
Thus shall we enrich other governments by distressing our own , and instead of increasing sobriety , only encourage a more expensive and pernicious kind of debauchery .


In the bill now under our consideration , a middle way is proposed , by which reformation may be introduced by those gradations which have always been found necessary when inveterate vices are to be encountered .
In this bill every necessary consideration appears to have been regarded , the health of the people will be preserved , and their virtue recovered , without destroying their trade or starving their manufacturers .


The efficacy of this bill seems , indeed , to be allowed by some of the lords who oppose it , since their chief objection has arisen from their doubts whether it can be executed .
If a law be useless in itself , it is of no importance whether it is executed or not  and , therefore , I think it may safely be inferred , that they who are solicitous how it may be enforced , are convinced of its usefulness .


If this , my lords , be the chief objection now remaining , a little consideration will easily remove it  for it is well known , that the only obstruction of the former law was the danger of information  but this law , my lords , is so contrived , that it will promote the execution of itself  for by setting licenses at so low a price , their number will be multiplied , and every man who has taken a license will think himself justified in informing against him that shall retail spirits without a legal right .


If , therefore , there should be , as a noble lord has very reasonably supposed , fifty thousand licensed venders of these liquors , there will likewise be fifty thousand informers against unlawful traders  and as the liquors may then always be had under sanction of the law , the populace will not interest themselves in that process which can have no tendency to obstruct their pleasure .


Thus , my lords , shall we , by agreeing to this bill , make a law that will be at once useful to the government and beneficial to the people , which will be at once powerful in its effects and easy in its execution  and , therefore , instead of attending any more to the wild and impracticable schemes of heavy taxes , rigorous punishments , sudden reformations , and violent restraints , I hope we shall unanimously approve this method , from which so much may be hoped , while nothing is hazarded .


Lord CARTERET then rose up , and spoke in substance as follows : -- My lords , though the noble lord who has been pleased to incite us to an unanimous concurrence with himself and his associates of the ministry , in passing this excellent and wonder-working bill , this bill , which is to lessen the consumption of spirits , without lessening the quantity which is distilled , which is to restrain drunkards from drinking , by setting their favourite liquor always before their eyes , to conquer habits by continuing them , and correct vice by indulging it , according to the lowest reckoning , for at least another year  yet , my lords , such is my obstinacy , or such my ignorance , that I can not yet comply with his proposal , nor can prevail with myself either to concur with measures so apparently opposite to the interest of the publick , or to hear them vindicated , without declaring how little I approve them .


During the course of this long debate I have endeavoured to recapitulate and digest the arguments which have been advanced , and have considered them both separate and conjoined  but find myself at the same distance from conviction as when I entered the house  nor do I imagine , that they can much affect any man who does not voluntarily assist them by strong prejudice .


In vindication of this bill , my lords , we have been told that the present law is ineffectual  that our manufacture is not to be destroyed , or not this year  that the security offered by the present bill has induced great numbers to subscribe to the new fund  that it has been approved by the commons  and that , if it be found ineffectual , it may be amended another session .


All these arguments , my lords , I shall endeavour to examine , because I am always desirous of gratifying those great men to whom the administration of affairs is intrusted , and have always very cautiously avoided the odium of disaffection which they will undoubtedly throw , in imitation of their predecessors , upon all those whose wayward consciences shall oblige them to hinder the execution of their schemes .


With a very strong desire , therefore , though with no great hopes of finding them in the right , I venture to begin my inquiry , and engage in the examination of their first assertion , that the present law against the abuse of strong liquors is without effect .


I hope , my lords , it portends well to my inquiry , that the first position which I have to examine is true , nor can I forbear to congratulate your lordships upon having heard from the new ministry one assertion not to be contradicted .


It is evident , my lords , from daily observation , and demonstrable from the papers upon the table , that every year , since the enaction of the last law , that vice has increased which it was intended to repress , and that no time has been so favourable to the retailers of spirits as that which has passed since they were prohibited .


It may , therefore , be expected , my lords , that having agreed with the ministers in their fundamental proposition , I shall concur with them in the consequence which they draw from it  and having allowed that the present law is ineffectual , should admit that another is necessary .


But , my lords , in order to discover whether this consequence be necessary , it must first be inquired why the present law is of no force ?
For , my lords , it will be found , upon reflection , that there are certain degrees of corruption that may hinder the effects of the best laws .
The magistrates may be vitious , and forbear to enforce that law , by which themselves are condemned  they may be indolent , and inclined rather to connive at wickedness by which they are not injured themselves , than to repress it by a laborious exertion of their authority  or they may be timorous , and , instead of awing the vitious , may be awed by them .


In any of these cases , my lords , the law is not to be condemned for its inefficacy , since it only fails by the defect of those who are to direct its operations  the best and most important laws will contribute very little to the security or happiness of a people , if no judges of integrity and spirit can be found amongst them .
Even the most beneficial and useful bill that ministers can possibly imagine , a bill for laying on our estates a tax of the fifth part of their yearly value , would be wholly without effect , if collectors could not be obtained .


I am , therefore , my lords , yet doubtful , whether the inefficacy of the law now subsisting necessarily obliges us to provide another  for those that declared it to be useless , owned at the same time , that no man endeavoured to enforce it  so that , perhaps , its only defect may be , that it will not execute itself .


Nor though I should allow , that the law is at present impeded by difficulties which can not be broken through , but by men of more spirit and dignity than the ministers may be inclined to trust with commissions of the peace , yet it can only be collected , that another law is necessary , not that the law now proposed will be of any advantage .


Great use has been made of the inefficacy of the present law to decry the proposal made by the noble lord for laying a high duty upon these pernicious liquors .
High duties have already , as we are informed , been tried without advantage  high duties are at this hour imposed upon those spirits which are retailed , yet we see them every day sold in the streets without the payment of the tax required  and , therefore , it will be folly to make a second essay of means which have been found , by the experience of many years , unsuccessful .


It has been granted on all sides in this debate , nor was it ever denied on any other occasion , that the consumption of any commodity is most easily to be hindered by raising its price , and its price is to be raised by the imposition of a duty  this , my lords , which is , I suppose , the opinion of every man , of whatever degree of experience or understanding , appears likewise to have been thought by the authors of the present law  and , therefore , they imagined , that they had effectually provided against the increase of drunkenness , by laying upon that liquor which should be retailed in small quantities , a duty which none of the inferiour classes of drunkards would be able to pay .


Thus , my lords , they conceived that they had reformed the common people , without infringing the pleasures of others , and applauded the happy contrivance by which spirits were to be made dear only to the poor , while every man who could afford to purchase two gallons , was at liberty to riot at his ease , and over a full flowing bumper look down with contempt upon his former companions , now ruthlessly condemned to disconsolate sobriety , or obliged to regale themselves with liquor which did no speedy execution upon their cares , but held them for many tedious hours in a languishing possession of their senses and their limbs .


But , my lords , this intention was frustrated , and the project , ingenious as it was , fell to the ground  for though they had laid a tax , they unhappily forgot that this tax would make no addition to the price , unless it was paid  and that it would not be paid , unless some were empowered to collect it .


Here , my lords , was the difficulty  those who made the law were inclined to lay a tax from which themselves should be exempt , and , therefore , would not charge the liquor as it issued from the still  and when once it was dispersed in the hands of petty dealers , it was no longer to be found without the assistance of informers , and informers could not carry on the business of persecution without the consent of the people .


It is not necessary to dwell any longer upon the law of which the repeal is proposed , since it appears already , that it failed only from a partiality not easily defended , and from the omission of what is now proposed , the collection of the duty as the liquor is distilled .


If this method be followed , there will be no longer any need of information , or of any rigorous or new measures  the same officers that collect a smaller duty may levy a greater , nor can they be easily deceived with regard to the quantities that are made  the deceits , at least , that can be used , are in use already  they are frequently detected and suppressed  nor will a larger duty enable the distillers to elude the vigilance of the officers with more success .


Against this proposal , therefore , the inefficacy of the present law can be no objection  but it is urged , that such duties would destroy the trade of distilling  and a noble lord has been pleased to express great tenderness for a manufacture so beneficial and extensive .


I can not but sometimes wonder , my lords , at the amazing variety of intellects , which every day furnishes some opportunity or other of observing , and which can not but be remarked on this occasion , when one produces against a proposal the very argument which another offers in its favour .
That a large duty levied at the still would destroy or very much impair the trade of distilling , is certainly supposed by those who defend it , for they proposed it only for that end  and what better method can they propose , when they are called to deliberate upon a bill for the prevention of the excessive use of distilled liquors ?


The noble lord has been pleased kindly to inform us , that the trade of distilling is very extensive , that it employs great numbers , and that they have arrived at exquisite skill , and therefore , -- note well the consequence -- the trade of distilling is not to be discouraged .


Once more , my lords , allow me to wonder at the different conceptions of different understandings .
It appears to me , that since the spirits which the distillers produce are allowed to enfeeble the limbs , and vitiate the blood , to pervert the heart , and obscure the intellects , that the number of distillers should be no argument in their favour !
For I never heard that a law against theft was repealed or delayed , because thieves were numerous .
It appears to me , my lords , that if so formidable a body are confederated against the virtue or the lives of their fellow-citizens , it is time to put an end to the havock , and to interpose , while it is yet in our power to stop the destruction .


As little , my lords , am I affected with the merit of the wonderful skill which the distillers are said to have attained : it is , in my opinion , no faculty of great use to mankind , to prepare palatable poison  nor shall I ever contribute my interest for the reprieve of a murderer , because he has , by long practice , obtained great dexterity in his trade .


If their liquors are so delicious , that the people are tempted to their own destruction , let us at length , my lords , secure them from these fatal draughts , by bursting the vials that contain them  let us crush , at once , these artists in slaughter , who have reconciled their countrymen to sickness and to ruin , and spread over the pitfals of debauchery such baits as can not be resisted .


The noble lord has , indeed , admitted , that this bill may not be found sufficiently coercive , but gives us hopes that it may be improved and enforced another year , and persuades us to endeavour the reformation of drunkenness by degrees , and above all , to beware , at present , of hurting the manufacture .


I am very far , my lords , from thinking , that there are this year any peculiar reasons for tolerating murder  nor can I conceive why the manufacture should be held sacred now , if it be to be destroyed hereafter  we are , indeed , desired to try how far this law will operate , that we may be more able to proceed with due regard to this valuable manufacture .


With regard to the operation of the law , it appears to me that it will only enrich the government without reforming the people , and I believe there are not many of a different opinion : if any diminution of the sale of spirits be expected from it , it is to be considered , that this diminution will or will not be such as is desired for the reformation of the people  if it be sufficient , the manufacture is at an end , and all the reasons against a higher duty are of equal force against this  but if it is not sufficient , we have , at least , omitted part of our duty , and have neglected the health and virtue of the people .


I can not , my lords , yet discover , why a reprieve is desired for this manufacture  why the present year is not equally propitious to the reformation of mankind as any will be that may succeed it .
It is true we are at war with two nations , and , perhaps , with more  but war may be better prosecuted without money than without men , and we but little consult the military glory of our country , if we raise supplies for paying our armies , by the destruction of those armies that we are contriving to pay .


We have heard the necessity of reforming the nation by degrees urged as an argument for imposing first a lighter duty , and afterwards a heavier  this complaisance for wickedness , my lords , is not so defensible as that it should be battered by arguments in form , and therefore I shall only relate a reply made by Webb , the noted walker , upon a parallel occasion .


This man , who must be remembered by many of your lordships , was remarkable for vigour , both of mind and body , and lived wholly upon water for his drink , and chiefly upon vegetables for his other sustenance : he was one day recommending his regimen to one of his friends who loved wine , and who , perhaps , might somewhat contribute to the prosperity of this spirituous manufacture , and urged him , with great earnestness , to quit a course of luxury by which his health and his intellects would equally be destroyed .
The gentleman appeared convinced , and told him , that he would conform to his counsel , and thought he could not change his course of life at once , but would leave off strong liquors by degrees .
By degrees , says the other , with indignation !
if you should unhappily fall into the fire , would you caution your servants not to pull you out but by degrees ?


This answer , my lords , is applicable in the present case  the nation is sunk into the lowest state of corruption , the people are not only vitious , but insolent beyond example  they not only break the laws , but defy them  and yet some of your lordships are for reforming them by degrees .


I am not easily persuaded , my lords , that our ministers really intend to supply the defects that may hereafter be discovered in this bill  it will doubtless produce money , perhaps much more than they appear to expect from it  I doubt not but the licensed retailers will be more than fifty thousand , and the quantity retailed must increase with the number of retailers .
As the bill will , therefore , answer all the ends intended by it , I do not expect to see it altered , for I have never observed ministers desirous of amending their own errours , unless they are such as produce a deficiency in the revenue .


Besides , my lords , it is not certain , that when this fund is mortgaged to the publick creditors , they can prevail upon the commons to change the security  they may continue the bill in force for the reasons , whatever they are , for which they have passed it , and the good intentions of our ministers , however sincere , may be defeated , and drunkenness , legal drunkenness , established in the nation .


This , my lords , is very reasonable  and therefore we ought to exert ourselves for the safety of the nation , while the power is yet in our own hands , and without regard to the opinion or proceedings of the other house , show that we are yet the chief guardians of the people , and the most vigilant adversaries of wickedness .


The ready compliance of the commons with the measures proposed in this bill , has been mentioned here with a view , I suppose , of influencing us , but surely by those who had forgotten our independence , or resigned their own .
It is not only the right , but the duty of either house , to deliberate without regard to the determinations of the other  for how would the nation receive any benefit from the distinct powers that compose the legislature , unless their determinations are without influence upon each other ?
If either the example or authority of the commons can divert us from following our own convictions , we are no longer part of the legislature  we have given up our honours and our privileges , and what then is our concurrence but slavery , or our suffrage but an echo ?


The only argument , therefore , that now remains , is the expediency of gratifying those by whose ready subscription the exigencies which the counsels of our new statesmen have brought upon us , and of continuing the security by which they have been encouraged to such liberal contributions .


Publick credit , my lords , is , indeed , of very great importance , but publick credit can never be long supported without publick virtue  nor indeed if the government could mortgage the morals and health of the people , would it be just or rational to confirm the bargain .
If the ministry can raise money only by the destruction of their fellow-subjects , they ought to abandon those schemes for which the money is necessary : for what calamity can be equal to unbounded wickedness ?


But , my lords , there is no necessity for a choice which may cost us or our ministers so much regret  for the same subscriptions may be procured by an offer of the same advantages to a fund of any other kind , and the sinking fund will easily supply any deficiency that might be suspected in another scheme .


To confess the truth , I should feel very little pain from an account that the nation was for some time determined to be less liberal of their contribution , and that money was withheld till it was known in what expeditions it was to be employed , to what princes subsidies were to be paid , and what advantages were to be purchased by it for our country .
I should rejoice my lords , to hear that the lottery by which the deficiencies of this duty are to be supplied , was not filled  and that the people were grown at last wise enough to discern the fraud , and to prefer honest commerce , by which all may be gainers , to a game by which the greatest number must certainly lose , and in which no man can reasonably expect that he shall be the happy favourite of fortune , on whom a prize shall be conferred .


The lotteries , my lords , which former ministers have proposed , have always been censured by those that saw their nature and their tendency  they have been considered as legal cheats , by which the ignorant and the rash are defrauded , and the subtle and avaricious often enriched  they have been allowed to divert the people from trade , and to alienate them from useful industry .
A man who is uneasy in his circumstances , and idle in his disposition , collects the remains of his fortune , and buys tickets in a lottery , retires from business , indulges himself in laziness , and waits , in some obscure place , the event of his adventure .
Another , instead of employing his stock in a shop or warehouse , rents a garret in a private street , and makes it his business , by false intelligence , and chimerical alarms , to raise and sink the price of tickets alternately , and takes advantage of the lies which he has himself invented .


Such , my lords , is the traffick that is produced by this scheme of raising money  nor were these inconveniencies unknown to the present ministers in the time of their predecessors , whom they never failed to pursue with the loudest clamours , whenever the exigencies of the government reduced them to a lottery .


If I , my lords , might presume to recommend to our ministers the most probable method of raising a large sum for the payment of the troops of the electorate , I should , instead of the tax and lottery now proposed , advise them to establish a certain number of licensed wheelbarrows , on which the laudable trade of thimble and button might be carried on for the support of the war , and shoeboys might contribute to the defence of the house of Austria , by raffling for apples .


Having now , my lords , examined with the utmost candour , all the reasons which have been offered in defence of the bill , I can not conceal the result of my inquiry .
The arguments have had so little effect upon my understanding , that as every man judges of others by himself , I can not believe that they have any influence , even upon those that offer them  and , therefore , I am convinced , that this bill must be the result of considerations which have been hitherto concealed , and is intended to promote designs which are never to be discovered by the authors before their execution .


With regard to these motives and designs , however artfully concealed , every lord in this assembly is yet at liberty to offer his conjectures  and therefore I shall venture to lay before you what has arisen in my mind , without pretending to have discovered absolute certainty , what such accomplished politicians have endeavoured to conceal .


When I consider , my lords , the tendency of this bill , I find it calculated only for the propagation of diseases , the suppression of industry , and the destruction of mankind  I find it the most fatal engine that ever was pointed at a people , an engine by which those who are not killed will be disabled , and those who preserve their limbs , will be deprived of their senses .


This bill , therefore , appears to be designed only to thin the ranks of mankind , and to disburden the world of the multitudes that inhabit it  and is , perhaps , the strongest proof of political sagacity that our new ministers have yet exhibited .
They well know , my lords , that they are universally detested , and that wherever a Briton is destroyed , they are freed from an enemy  they have , therefore , opened the floodgates of gin upon the nation , that when it is less numerous , it may be more easily governed .


Other ministers , my lords , who had not attained to so great a knowledge in the art of making war upon their country , when they found their enemies clamorous and bold , used to awe them with prosecutions and penalties , or destroy them like burglars , with prisons and gibbets .
But every age , my lords , produces some improvement , and every nation , however degenerate , gives birth at some happy period of time to men of great and enterprising genius .
It is our fortune to be witnesses of a new discovery in politicks  we may congratulate ourselves upon being contemporaries with those men who have shown that hangmen and halters are unnecessary in a state , and that ministers may escape the reproach of destroying their enemies , by inciting them to destroy themselves .


This new method may , indeed , have upon different constitutions a different operation  it may destroy the lives of some , and the senses of others  but either of these effects will answer the purposes of the ministry , to whom it is indifferent , provided the nation becomes insensible , whether pestilence or lunacy prevails among them .
Either mad or dead , the greatest part of the people must quickly be , or there is no hope of the continuance of the present ministry .


For this purpose , my lords , what could have been invented more efficacious than an establishment of a certain number of shops at which poison may be vended  poison so prepared , as to please the palate while it wastes the strength , and to kill only by intoxication .
From the first instant that any of the enemies of the ministry shall grow clamorous and turbulent , a crafty hireling may lead him to the ministerial slaughterhouse , and ply him with their wonder-working liquor , till he is no longer able to speak or think  and , my lords , no man can be more agreeable to our ministers than he that can neither speak nor think , except those who speak without thinking .


But , my lords , the ministers ought to reflect , that though all the people of the present age are their enemies , yet they have made no trial of the temper and inclinations of posterity  our successours may be of opinions very different from ours  they may , perhaps , approve of wars on the continent , while our plantations are insulted , and our trade obstructed  they may think the support of the house of Austria of more importance to us than our own defence , and may , perhaps , so far differ from their fathers , as to imagine the treasures of Britain very properly employed in supporting the troops , and increasing the splendour of a foreign electorate .


Since , therefore , it will not be denied by our ministers , that the affection and gratitude of posterity may atone for the obstinacy , blindness , and malice of the present age  since those measures which are now universally censured , may at some distant time be praised with equal unanimity  why , my lords , should they extend their vengeance to the succeeding generation ?
why should they endeavour to torture their limbs with pains , and load their lives with the guilt of their parents ?
why should they hinder that trade to which they must owe all the comforts which plenty affords ?
why should they endeavour to intercept their existence , or suffer them to exist only to be wretched ?


If I may once more declare my sentiments , my lords , I believe the ministers do not so much wish to debilitate the bodies as the understandings of posterity , nor so ardently desire a race of cripples as of fools .
For cripples , my lords , can make no figure at a review , nor strut in a red coat with a tolerable grace  but fools are known by long experience to be the principal support of an army , since they are the only persons who are willing to pay it !


Whatever , my lords , be the true reasons for which this bill is so warmly promoted , I think they ought , at least , to be deliberately examined  and , therefore , can not think it consistent with our regard for the nation to suffer it to be precipitated into a law .
The year , my lords , is not so far advanced , as that supplies may not be raised by some other method , if this should be rejected  nor do I think that we ought to consent to this , even though our refusal should hinder the supplies , since we have no right , for the sake of any advantage , however certain or great , to violate all the laws of heaven and earth , to doom thousands to destruction , and to fill the exchequer with the price of the lives of our fellow-subjects .


Let us , therefore , my lords , not suffer ourselves to be driven forward with such haste as may hinder us from observing whither we are going  let us not be persuaded to precipitate our counsels by those who know that all delays will be detrimental to their designs , because delays may produce new information , and they are conscious that the bill will be less approved the more it is understood .


But every reason which they can offer against the motion , is , in my opinion , a reason for it  and , therefore , I shall readily agree to postpone the clause , and no less readily to reject the bill .


If , at last , reason and evidence are vain , if neither justice nor compassion can prevail , but the nation must be destroyed for the support of the government , let us at least , my lords , confine our assertions , in the preamble , to truth  let us not affirm that drunkenness is established by the advice or consent of the lords spiritual , since I am confident not one of them will so far contradict his own doctrine , as to vote for a bill which gives a sanction to one vice , and ministers opportunities and temptations to all others  and which , if it be not speedily repealed , will overflow the whole nation with a deluge of wickedness .


Lord ISLAY next spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , I have attended for a long time to the noble lord , not without some degree of uneasiness , as I think the manner in which he has treated the question neither consistent with the dignity of this assembly , nor with those rules which ought to be ever venerable , the great rules of reason and humanity .
Yet being now arrived at a time of life in which the passions grow calm , and patience easily prevails over any sudden disgust or perturbation , I forbore to disconcert him , though I have known interruption produced by much slighter provocations .


It is , my lords , in my opinion , a just maxim , that our deliberations can receive very little assistance from merriment and ridicule , and that truth is seldom discovered by those who are chiefly solicitous to start a jest .
To convince the understanding , and to tickle the fancy , are purposes very different , and must be promoted by different means  nor is he always to imagine himself superiour in the dispute , who is applauded with the loudest laugh .


To laugh , my lords , and to endeavour to communicate the same mirth to others , when great affairs are to be considered , is certainly to neglect the end for which we are assembled , and the reasons for which the privilege of debating was originally granted us .
For doubtless , my lords , our honours and our power were not conferred upon us that we might be merry with the better grace , or that we might meet at certain times to divert ourselves with turning the great affairs of the nation to ridicule .


But , my lords , still less defensible is this practice , when we are contriving the relief of misery , or the reformation of vice  when calamities are preying upon thousands , and the happiness not only of the present age , but of posterity , must depend upon our resolutions .
He that can divert himself with the sight of misery , has surely very little claim to the great praise of humanity and tenderness  nor can he be justly exempted from the censure of increasing evils , who wastes in laughter and jocularity that time in which he might relieve them .


The bill now before us has been represented by those that oppose it , as big with destruction , and dangerous both to the lives and to the virtue of the people .
We have been told , that it will at once fill the land with sickness and with villany , and that it will be at the same time fatal to our trade , and to our power  yet those who are willing to be thought fearful of all these evils , and ardently desirous of averting them from their country , can not without laughter mention the bill which they oppose , or enumerate the consequences which they dread from it , in any other language than that of irony and burlesque .


Surely , my lords , such conduct gives reason for questioning either their humanity , or their sincerity  for if they really fear such dreadful calamities , how can they be at leisure for mirth and gaiety I How can they sport over the grave of millions , and indulge their vain ridicule , when the ruin of their country is approaching ?


But without inquiry , whether they who oppose the bill will grant their opposition hypocritical , or their patriotism languid , I shall lay my opinion of this new regulation before your lordships with equal freedom , though with less luxuriance of imagination , and less gaiety of language .


Of this bill , notwithstanding the acuteness with which it has been examined , and the acrimony with which it has been censured , I am not afraid to affirm , that it is neither wicked nor absurd , that all its parts are consistent , and that the effects to be expected from it are sobriety and health .
I can not find , upon the closest examination , either that it will defeat its own end , or that the end proposed by it is different from that which is professed .


The charge of encouraging vice and tolerating drunkenness , with which the defenders of this bill have been so liberally aspersed , may be , in my opinion , more justly retorted upon those that oppose it  who , though they plead for the continuance of a law , rigorous , indeed , and well intended , own that it has , by the experience of several years , been found ineffectual .


What , my lords , can a drunkard or a profligate be supposed to wish , but that the law may still remain in its present state , that he may still be pursued in a track by which he knows how to escape , and opposed by restraints which he is able to break ?
What can he desire , but that the book of statutes should lie useless , and that no laws should be made against him , but such as can not be put in execution ?


The defects of the present law , are , indeed , very numerous  nor ought it to be continued , even though no other were to be substituted .
It seems to suppose the use of distilled liquors absolutely unlawful , and , therefore , imposed upon licenses a duty so enormous , that only three were taken in the whole kingdom , and the people were therefore obliged to obtain by illegal methods , what they could not persuade themselves wholly to forbear .


The method of detecting offenders was likewise such as gave opportunity for villany to triumph over innocence , and for perjury to grow rich with the plunder of the poor .
Even charity itself might be punished by it  and he that gave a glass of spirits to a man fainting under poverty , or sickness , or fatigue , might be punished as a retailer of spirits without a license .


These defects , which were not seen when the law was made , soon excited a dislike .
No man enforced the execution of it , because every man knew that on some occasions he might himself break it  and they who suffered for the violation of it , were often pitied by those whose office obliged them to punish them .
Thus the law , after having been executed a few months with rigour , was laid aside as impracticable , and appears now to be tacitly repealed  for it is apparently an empty form without effect .


If , therefore , the use of spirits be so destructive as is generally allowed , it is surely necessary , that the legislature should at last repair the defects of the former law , and the nation should not be vitiated and ruined , without some endeavours for its preservation  and , in my opinion , to lay a double duty upon these liquors , is very rational and prudent .
An increase of the price must lessen the consumption .


To what degree the consumption will be diminished by this new duty , I am not able to foretel  but , undoubtedly , some diminution will be produced , and the least diminution will afford us this comfort , that the evil does not increase upon us , and that this law is , therefore , better than that which we have repealed .


For this reason , my lords , I approve the present bill , without inquiring whether it is perfect  it is sufficient for me , in the present exigence , that the nation will gain something by the change , and the people will be drawn nearer to sobriety , temperance , and industry .


Thus , my lords , without paying any regard to the determination of the other house , I think the bill sufficiently defensible by reason and policy  nor can I conceal my opinion , that those who oppose it are the real enemies of their country .


[ The question , whether the house should be now resumed , was then put and determined in the negative by 56 against 85 .


The other clauses were then read , and agreed to .


The course of their proceedings then required , that a day should be appointed for the third reading , and lord SANDWICH therefore rose , and spoke to the following effect :]


My lords , as the importance of the bill now before us justly demands the maturest consideration , it is not without unusual concern , that I observe the absence of many lords , for whose wisdom and experience I have the highest veneration , and whom I esteem equally for their penetration and their integrity .
I should hope , that all those who feel in their hearts the love of their country , and are conscious of abilities to promote its happiness , would assemble on this great occasion , and that the collective wisdom of this house would be exerted , when the lives and fortunes , and , what is yet more worthy of regard , the virtue of the people is involved in the question .


As there can be no avocations which can possibly withhold a wise man from counsels of such moment to his country , to himself , and to his posterity  as there is no interest equivalent to the general happiness  I can not suppose that either business or pleasure detain those who have not attended at the examination of this bill  and therefore imagine , that they are absent only because they have not been sufficiently informed of the importance of the question that was this day to be discussed .


It is therefore , my lords , necessary , in my opinion , that on the day of the third reading they be again summoned to attend , that the law which is allowed to be only an experiment , of which the event is absolutely uncertain , may be examined with the utmost care  that all its consequences may be known , so far as human wisdom is able to discover , and that we may at least be exempt from the imputation of being negligent of the welfare of our country , and of being desirous of avoiding information or inquiry , lest they should retard our measures or contradict our assertions .


But since it is reasonable to believe , my lords , that many of those , who might assist us in this difficult inquiry , are now in the country , it is necessary , that our summons may have the effect which is desired , to defer the reading for some time .
For to what purpose will it be to require their presence at a time at which we know it is impossible for them to comply with our orders ?
To direct what can not be done is surely in its own nature absurd and contemptible , and on this occasion will expose not only our understanding but our honesty to doubts  for it will be imagined , that we are only endeavouring to make false shows of caution and accuracy , and that we in reality desire to determine without the concurrence of those whose presence we publickly require .


I therefore move , that the third reading of this bill may be delayed five days , and that immediate summons be issued for all lords to attend .


Lord CARTERET spoke next in substance as follows : -- My lords , if it is the intention of the noble lords to debate once more the usefulness or expedience of this bill , if they have any new argument to produce , or are desirous of another opportunity to repeat those which have been already heard , I hope they will not long withhold , either from themselves or their opponents , that satisfaction .


Your lordships are so well acquainted with the state of the publick , and know so well the danger of the liberties of the continent , the power of the enemies whom we are to oppose , the dreadful consequences of an unsuccessful opposition , and the necessity of vigour and expedition to procure success , that it can not be necessary to urge the impropriety of delaying the bill from which the supplies are to be expected .


The convenience of deferring this bill , however plausibly represented by the noble lord who made the motion , is overbalanced by the necessity of considering it to-morrow .
Necessity is an argument which 110 acuteness can overthrow , and against which eloquence will be employed to little purpose .
I therefore , my lords , oppose the motion , not that it is unreasonable in itself , but because it can not be admitted  I recommend despatch on this occasion , not because it is barely right , but because it is absolutely necessary .


Lord HERVEY then rose up and spoke to the following effect : -- My lords , it is always the last resource of ministers to call those measures necessary which they can not show to be just  and when they have tried all the arts of fallacy and illusion , and found them all baffled , to stand at bay , because they can fly no longer , look their opponents boldly in the face , and stun them with the formidable sound of necessity .


But it is generally the fortune of ministers to discover necessity much sooner than they whose eyes are not sharpened by employments  they frequently call that necessity , on which no other man would bestow the title of expediency  and that is seldom necessary to be done , which others do not think necessary to be avoided .


At present , my lords , I see nothing necessary but what is equally necessary at all times , that we do our duty to our country , and discharge our trust , without suffering ourselves to be terrified with imaginary dangers or allured by imaginary benefits .
The war which is said to produce the necessity of this bill , is , in my opinion , not necessary in itself : and , if your lordships differ from me in that sentiment , it must yet be allowed , that there is time sufficient to provide supplies by new methods .


But , my lords , if the motion , in which I concur , be overruled on a pretence of necessity , it will show an eager desire to hasten a bill , which , if referred to any twelve men , not of either house of the senate , their examination would terminate in this , that they bring it in guilty of wilful murder .


Lord CHOLMONDELEY spoke next , in substance as follows : -- My lords , as there is no doubt but particular measures may be sometimes necessary , I discover no reason that ought to hinder the mention of that necessity  for surely where it can be asserted with truth , it is the most powerful of all arguments , and can not be wisely or honestly neglected .


In the present case , my lords , I can discover no impropriety in mentioning it  for I suppose that noble lord did not intend to restrain it to the most rigorous sense  he did not mean , that there is the same necessity of reading this bill to-morrow for the success of the war , as of extinguishing a fire for the preservation of a town  but that the reasons for despatch absolutely overbalanced all the pleas that could be offered for delays .


This necessity , my lords , I am not ashamed to assert after him  nor can I think it consistent with common prudence , in the present situation of our affairs , to defer the third reading beyond to-morrow  for the supplies which this bill must produce , are to be employed in attempts of the utmost importance , and which can not fail without the ruin of a great part of mankind , and an irreparable injury to this nation .


I can not , therefore , but confess my surprise at the vehemence with which this bill is opposed  vehemence so turbulent and fierce , that some lords have been transported beyond that decency which it is our duty and our interest to preserve in our deliberations  nor have restrained themselves from expressions , which , upon reflection , I believe they will not think defensible  from among which I can not but particularize the horrid and opprobrious term of murder .


The reverend prelates , who have spoken against the bill , may be easily believed to be as zealous for virtue as those who have indulged themselves in this violence of language  yet they have never charged those who defend the measures now proposed with the guilt of murder , but have decently delivered their own opinions , without , reproaching those who differ from them .


For my part , my lords , as I can not think the motion for farther delay , seasonable or proper , or necessary to the discovery of truth , or consistent with the welfare of the nation , it is my resolution to vote against it .


The duke of BEDFORD spoke next , in substance as follows : -- My lords , the ardour with which the noble lord appears to resent the indignity offered to the bill , shows only that he himself approves it , but not that it deserves the approbation of the house .


I think it of use , notwithstanding the plausible pleas of decency or politeness , that every thing should in this house be called by its right name , that we may not dispute for one thing , and vote for another  and since the bill will certainly destroy multitudes , if it promotes the sale of distilled spirits , and it has been proved that it will promote it , I know not by what appellation to denominate its effects , if that be denied me , which has been already used .


[ The speaker then put the question in form , `` Is it your lordships ' pleasure , that the third reading of the bill be put off for five days ? ''
It was resolved in the negative by 52 to 29 .


It was then ordered , that the bill should be read the third time on the day following , and that the lords should be summoned to attend .


On the next day , the house , according to the order , met , and another debate ensued , which was begun by lord HERVEY , who spoke in substance as follows :]


My lords , the tendency of the bill , which we are now to approve or reject , is so apparently destructive to the ends of government , so apparently dangerous to publick happiness , and so contrary to the institutions of the most celebrated lawgivers , and the policy of the most flourishing nations , that I still continue to think it my duty to struggle against it .


Almost every legislator of the world , my lords , from whatever original he derived his authority , has exerted it in the prohibition of such foods as tended to injure the health , and destroy the vigour of the people for whom he designed his institutions .


The great instructor of the jews , who delivered his laws by divine authority , prohibited the use of swine 's flesh , for no other cause , so far as human reason is able to discover , than that it corrupted the blood , and produced loathsome diseases and maladies which descended to posterity  and , therefore , in prohibiting , after this example , the use of liquors which produce the same effects , we shall follow the authority of the great governour of the universe .


The author of another religion , a religion founded , indeed , on superstition and credulity , but which prevails over a very great part of the earth , has laid his followers under restraints still more severe  he has forbidden them to dispel their cares , or exalt their pleasures , with wine , has banished from their banquets that useful opponent of troublesome reflection , and doomed all those who receive his law , not to sobriety only , but to abstinence .


The authority of this man , my lords , can not indeed be urged as unexceptionable and decisive  but the reception of his imposture shows at least , that he was not unacquainted with human nature , and that he knew how to adapt his forgeries to the nations among which he vented them  nor can it be denied , but the prohibition of wine was found generally useful , since it obtained so ready a compliance .


All nations in the world , my lords , in every age of which there remain any historical accounts , have agreed in the necessity of laying restraint upon appetite , and setting bounds to the wantonness of luxury  every legislature has claimed and practised the right of withholding those pleasures which the people have appeared inclined to use to excess , and preferring the safety of multitudes whom liberty would destroy , to the convenience of those who would have enjoyed it within the limits of reason and of virtue .


The welfare of the publick , my lords , has always been allowed the supreme law  and when any governours sacrifice the general good either to private views , or temporary convenience , they deviate at once from integrity and policy , they betray their trust , and neglect their interest .


The prohibition of those commodities which are instrumental to vice , is not only dictated by policy but nature  nor does it , indeed , require much sagacity , when the evil is known , to find the proper remedy  for even the Indians , who have not yet reduced the art of government to a science , nor learned to make long harangues upon the different interests of foreign powers , the necessity of raising supplies or the importance and extent of manufactures , have yet been able to discover , that distilled spirits are pernicious to society , and that the use of them can only be hindered by prohibiting the sale .


For this reason , my lords , they have petitioned , that none of this delicious poison should be imported from .
Britain  they have desired us to confine this fountain of wickedness and misery to stream in our own country , without pouring upon them those inundations of debauchery , by which we are ourselves overflowed .


When we may be sent with justice to learn from the rude and ignorant Indians the first elements of civil wisdom , we have surely not much right to boast of our foresight and knowledge  we must surely confess , that we have hitherto valued ourselves upon our arts with very little reason , since we have not learned how to preserve either wealth or virtue , either peace or commerce .


The maxims of our politicians , my lords , differ widely from those of the Indian savages , as they are the effects of longer consideration , and reasonings formed upon more extensive views .
What Indian , my lords , would have contrived to hinder his countrymen from drunkenness , by placing that liquor in their houses which tempted them to excess  or would have discovered , that prohibition only were the cause of boundless excesses  that to subdue the appetite nothing was necessary but to solicit it  and that what was always offered would never be received ?
The Indians , in the simplicity of men unacquainted with European and British refinements , imagined , that to put an end to the use of any thing , it was only necessary to take it away  and conceived , that they could not promote sobriety more effectually , than by allowing the people nothing with which they could be drunk .


But if our politicians should send missionaries to teach them the art of government , they would quickly be shown , that if they would accomplish their design , they must appoint every tenth man among them to distribute spirits to the nine , and to drink them himself in what quantity they shall desire , and that then the peace of their country will be no longer disturbed by the quarrels of debauchery .


It is , indeed , not without amazement , that I hear this bill seriously defended as a scheme for suppressing drunkenness , and find some lords , who admit that fifty thousand houses will be opened for the publick sale of spirits , assert that a less quantity of spirits will be sold .


The foundation of this opinion is in itself very uncertain  for nothing more is urged , but that all who sell under the sanction of a license , will be ready to inform against those by whom no license has been purchased  and that , therefore , fifty thousand licensed retailers may hurt a greater number who now sell spirits in opposition to the law .


All this , my lords , is very far from certainty  for it can not be proved , that there are now so great a number of retailers as this act may produce : it is likely that security will encourage many to engage in this trade , who are at present deterred from it by danger .
It is possible , that those who purchase licenses may nevertheless forbear to prosecute those that sell spirits without the protection of the law .
They may forbear , my lords , from the common principles of humanity , because they think those poor traders deserve rather pity than punishment  they may forbear from a principle that operates more frequently , and too often more strongly  a regard to their own interest .
They may themselves offend the law by some other parts of their conduct , and may be unwilling to provoke an inspection into their own actions , by betraying officiously the faults of their neighbours  or they may be influenced by immediate terrours , and expect to be hunted to death by the rage of the populace .


All these considerations may be urged against the only supposition that has been made , with any show of reason , in favour of the bill  and of these various circumstances , some one or other will almost always be found .
Every man will have either fear or pity , because almost every good man is inclined to compassion , and every wicked man is in danger from the law  and I do not see any reason for imagining that the people will tolerate informers more willingly now than in the late years .


But suppose it should be granted , though it can not be certain , and has not yet been shown to be probable , that the clandestine trade will be interrupted  I am not able to follow these ministerial reasoners immediately to the consequence which they draw from this concession , and which must be drawn from it , if it be of any use in the decision of the question , nor can see that the consumption of spirituous liquors will be made less .


Let us examine , my lords , the premises and the consequences together , without suffering our attention to be led astray by useless digressions .
Spirits will be now sold only with license !
therefore less will be sold than when it was sold only by stealth !


Surely , my lords , such arguments will not much influence this assembly .
Why , my lords , should less be bought now than formerly ?
It is not denied , that there will be in every place a licensed shop , where drunkards may riot in security  and what can be more inviting to wretches who place in drunkenness their utmost felicity I If you should favourably suppose no more to be sold , yet why should those who now buy any supposed quantity , buy less when the restraint is taken away ?


If it be urged , that the present law does in reality impose no restraint , the intended act will make no alteration .
There is no real prohibition now , there will be no nominal prohibition hereafter  and , therefore , the law will only produce what its advocates expect from it , a yearly addition to the revenue of the government .
But , my lords , let us at last inquire to what it is to be imputed , that the present law swells the statute book to no purpose ?
and why this pernicious trade is carried on with confidence and security , in opposition to the law ?
It will not surely be confessed , that the government has wanted authority to execute its own laws  that the legislature has been awed by the populace , by the dregs of the populace , the drunkards and the beggars !
Yet when the provisions made for the execution of a law so salutary , so just , and so necessary , were found defective , why were not others substituted of greater efficacy ?
Why , when one informer was torn in pieces , were there not new securities proposed to protect those who should by the same offence displease the people afterwards ?


The law , my lords , has failed of a great part of its effect  but it has failed by cowardice on one part , and negligence on another  and though the duty , as it was laid , was in itself somewhat invidious , it would , however , have been enforced , could the revenue have gained as much by the punishment as was gained by the toleration of debauchery .
It has , however , some effect  it may be imagined , that no man can be trusted where he is not known , and that some men are known too well to be trusted  and , therefore , many must be occasionally hindered from drinking spirits , while the law remains in its present state  who , when houses are set open by license , will never want an opportunity of complying with their appetites , but may at any time enter confidently , and call for poison , and mingle with numerous assemblies met only to provoke each other to intemperance by a kind of brutal emulation and obstreperous merriment .


This bill , therefore , my lords , is , as it has been termed , only an experiment  an experiment , my lords , of a very daring kind , which none would hazard but empirical politicians .
It is an experiment to discover how far the vices of the populace may be made useful to the government , what taxes may be raised upon poison , and how much the court may be enriched by the destruction of the subjects .


The tendency of this bill is so evident , that those who appeared as its advocates have rather endeavoured to defeat their opponents by charging their proposals with absurdity , than by extenuating the ill consequence of their own scheme .


Their principal charge is , that those who oppose the bill recommend a total prohibition of all spirits .
This assertion gives them an opportunity of abandoning their own cause , to expatiate upon the innocent uses of spirits , of their efficacy in medicine , and their convenience in domestick business , and to advance a multitude of positions which they know will not be denied , but which may be at once made useless to them , by assuring them , that no man desires to destroy the distillery for the pleasure of destroying it , or intends any thing more than some provisions which may hinder distilled spirits from being drunk by common people upon common occasions .


Having thus obviated the only answer that has hitherto been made to the strong arguments which have been offered against the bill , I must declare , that I have heard nothing else that deserves an answer , or that can possibly make any impression in favour of the bill  a bill , my lords , teeming with sedition and idleness , diseases and robberies  a bill that will enfeeble the body , corrupt the mind , and turn the cities of this populous kingdom into prisons for villains , or hospitals for cripples  and which I think it , therefore , our duty to reject .


Lord LONSDALE next spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , the bill , on which we are now finally to determine , is of such a tendency , that it can not be made a law , without an open and avowed disregard of all the rules which it has been hitherto thought the general interest of human nature to preserve inviolable .
It is opposite at once to the precepts of the wise , and the practice of the good , to the original principles of virtue and the established maxims of policy .


I shall , however , only consider it with relation to policy , because the other considerations will naturally coincide  for policy is only the connexion of prudence with goodness , and directs only what virtue each particular occurrence requires to be immediately practised .


The first principle of policy , my lords , teaches us , that the power and greatness of a state arises from the number of its people  uninhabited dominions are an empty show , and serve only to encumber the nation to which they belong  they are a kind of pompous ornaments , which must be thrown away in time of danger , and equally unfit for resistance and retreat .


In the present war , my lords , if the number of our people were equal to that of the two nations against which we are engaged , the narrowness of our dominions would give us a resistless superiority  as we have fewer posts to defend , we might send more forces to attack our enemies , who must be weak in every part , because they must be dispersed to a very great extent .
The torrent of war , as a flood of water , is only violent while it is confined , but loses its force as it is more diffused .


In consequence of this maxim , my lords , it is proposed , that because we are at war against two mighty powers , we shall endeavour to destroy by spirits at home , those who can not fall by the sword of the enemy , and that we endeavour to hinder the production of another generation  for it is well known , my lords , and has in this debate been universally allowed , that the present practice of drinking spirits will not only destroy the present race , but debilitate the next .


This surely , my lords , is a time at which we ought very studiously to watch over the preservation of those lives which we are not compelled to expose , and endeavour to retrieve the losses of war by encouraging industry , temperance , and sobriety .


Another principle of government which the wisdom of our progenitors established , was to suppress vice with the utmost diligence  for as vice must always produce misery to those whom it infects , and danger to those who are considered as its enemies , it is contrary to the end of government  and the government which encourages vice is necessarily labouring for its own destruction  for the good will not support it , because they are not benefited by it , and the wicked will betray it , because they are wicked .


How little then , my lords , do our sagacious politicians understand their own interest by promoting drunkenness and luxury , of which the natural train of consequences are idleness , necessity , wickedness , desperation , sedition , and anarchy !
How little do they understand what it is that gives stability to the fabrick of our constitution , if they imagine it can long stand , when it is not supported by virtue .


In consequence of these maxims , another may be advanced , that all trades which tend to impair either the health or virtue of the people , should be interdicted  for since the strength of the community consists in the number and happiness of the people , no trade deserves to be cultivated which does not contribute to the one or the other  for the end of trade , as of all other human attempts , is the attainment of happiness .


If any trade that conduces not to the happiness of the community by increasing either the number or the virtue of the people , be industriously cultivated , the legislature ought to suppress it  if any manufacture that administers temptations to wickedness be flourishing and extensive , it has already been too long indulged  and the government can atone for its remissness only by rigorous inhibition , severe prosecutions , and vigilant inquiries .


That the trade of distilling , my lords , had advanced so fast among us , that our manufacturers of poison are arrived at the utmost degree of skill in their profession , and that the draughts which they prepare are greedily swallowed by those who rarely look beyond the present moment , or inquire what price must be paid for the present gratification  that the people have been so long accustomed to daily stupefaction , that they are become mutinous , if they are restrained from it  and that the law which was intended to suppress their luxury can not , without tumults and bloodshed , be put in execution , are , in my opinion , very affecting considerations , but they can surely be of no use for the defence of this bill .


The more extensive the trade of distilling , the more must swallow the poison which it affords  the more palatable the liquor is made , the more dangerous is the temptation  and the more corrupt the people are become , the more urgent is the necessity of extirpating those that have corrupted them .


I am not , my lords , less convinced of the importance of trade , than those lords who have spoken in the most pathetick language for the continuance of the manufacture  but my regard for trade naturally determines me to vote against a bill by which idleness , the pest of commerce , must be encouraged , and those hands , by which our trade is to be carried on , must be first enfeebled , and soon afterwards destroyed .


Nor is this kind of debauchery , my lords , less destructive to the interest of those whose riches consist in lands , than of those who are engaged in commerce  for it undoubtedly hinders the consumption of almost every thing that land can produce  of that corn which should be made into bread , and brewed into more wholesome drink  of that flesh which is fed for the market , and even of that wool which should be worked into cloth .
It has been often mentioned ludicrously , but with too much truth , that strong liquors are to the meaner people , meat , drink , and clothes  that they depend upon them alone for sustenance and warmth , and that they desire to forget their wants in drunkenness rather than supply them .
If we , therefore , examine this question with regard to trade , we shall find , that the money which is spent in drunkenness for the advantage only of one distiller , would support , if otherwise expended , a great number of labourers , husbandmen , and traders  since one man employed at the still may supply with the means of debauchery such numbers as could not be furnished with innocent victuals and warm clothes , but by the industry of many hands , and the concurrence of many trades .


Numbers , my lords , are necessary to success in commerce as in war  if the manufacturers be few , labour will be dear , and the value of the commodity must always be proportioned to the price of labour .


These , my lords , are the arguments by which I have hitherto been incited to oppose this bill , which I have not found that any of its defenders can elude or repel  for they content themselves with a cowardly concession to the multitude , allow them to proceed in wickedness , confess they have found themselves unable to oppose their sovereign pleasure , or to withhold them from pursuing their own inclinations  and , therefore , have sagaciously contrived a scheme , by which they hope to gain some advantage from the vices which they can not reform .


But who , my lords , can , without horrour and indignation , hear those who are entrusted with the care of the publick , contriving to take advantage of the ruin of their country ?


Let others , my lords , vote as their consciences will direct them , I shall likewise follow the dictates of my heart , and shall avoid any concurrence with a scheme , which , though it may for a time benefit the government , must destroy the strength and virtue of the people , and at once impair our trade and depopulate our country .


Lord CARTERET then rose up , and spoke in substance as follows : -- My lords , the warmth with which this debate has been hitherto carried on , and with which the progress of this bill has been opposed , is , in my opinion , to be imputed to strong prejudices , formed when the question was first proposed  by which the noble lords have been incited to warm declamations and violent invectives  who , having once heated their minds with suspicions , have not been able to consider the propositions before them with calmness and impartiality  but have pursued their first notions , and have employed their eloquence in displaying the absurdity of positions never advanced , and the mischief of consequences which will never be produced .


It is first to be considered , my lords , that this bill is intended , not to promote , but to hinder , the consumption of spirituous liquors  it is , therefore , by no means necessary to expatiate upon that which is presupposed in the bill , the pernicious quality of spirits , the detestable nature of drunkenness , the wickedness or miseries which are produced by it .
Almost all that has been urged by the noble lords who have spoken with the greatest warmth against the bill , may reasonably be conceived to have been advanced for it by those who projected it  of whom it may be justly imagined , that they were fully convinced how much spirits were abused by the common people , and how much that abuse contributed to the wickedness which at present prevails amongst us , since they thought it necessary to prevent them by a new law .


But , my lords , when they saw that the abuse of distilled liquors was in a very high degree detrimental to the publick , they saw , likewise , that the trade of distilling was of great use  that it employed great numbers of our people , and consumed a great part of the produce of our lands  and that , therefore , it could not be suppressed , without injuring the publick , by reducing many families to sudden poverty , and by depriving the farmers of a market for a great part of their corn .
In the plains of the western part of this island , the grain that is chiefly cultivated is barley , and that barley is chiefly consumed by the distillers  nor , if they should be at once suppressed , could the husbandman readily sell the produce of his labour and his grounds , or the landlord receive rent for his estate  since it would then produce nothing , or what is in effect the same , nothing that could be sold .


It is , indeed , possible , my lords , that the Dutch might buy it  but then it must be considered , that we must pay them money for the favour , since we allow a premium upon exportation , and that we shall buy it back again in spirits , and , consequently , pay them for manufacturing our own product .
For it is not to be imagined , that any law will immediately reclaim the dispositions , or reform the appetites of the people .
They are well known to have drank spirits before they were made in our country , and to indulge themselves at present in many kinds of luxury which are yet loaded with a very high tax .
It is not , therefore , probable , that upon the imposition of a high duty they will immediately desist from drinking spirits  they will , indeed , as now , drink those which can be most easily procured  and if , by a high tax suddenly imposed , foreign spirits be made cheaper than our own , foreign spirits will only be used , our distillery will be destroyed , and our people will yet not be reformed .


That heavy taxes will not deter the people from any favourite enjoyment , has been already shown by the unsuccessfulness of the last attempt to restrain them from the use of spirits , and may be every day discovered from the use of tobacco , which is universally taken by the common people , though a very high duty is laid upon it , and though a king thought it so pernicious that he employed his pen against it .
The commons , therefore , prudently forbore to use violent measures , which might disgust the people , but which they had no reason to believe sufficient to reform them , and thought it more expedient to proceed by more gentle methods , which might operate by imperceptible degrees , and which might be made more forcible and compulsive , if they should be found ineffectual .


Another evil will by this method , likewise , be avoided , which is the certain consequence of high duties  this tax will produce no clandestine frauds nor rebellious defiance of the legislature  the distillers will not be tempted to evade this impost by perjuries , too often practised where the profit of them is great , nor smugglers to assemble in numerous troops with arms in their hands , and carry imported liquors through the country by force , in opposition to the officers of the customs , and the laws of the nation .
That this , likewise , is practised upon other occasions to escape heavy taxes , all the weekly papers inform us  nor are there many months in which some of the king 's officers are not maimed or murdered doing of their duty .


All these evils , my lords , and a thousand others , will be avoided by an easy tax  in favour of which I can not but wonder , that it should be necessary to plead so long , since every nation , which has any pretension to civility or a regular government , will agree , that heavy imposts are not to be wantonly inflicted , and that severity is never to be practised till lenity has failed .


It , therefore , appears to me , my lords , that justice , reason , and experience , unite in favour of this bill  and that nothing is to be feared from it , but that it will not be sufficiently coercive , nor restrain the abuse of spirits so much as is hoped by those that have stood up in its vindication .
That it can encourage drunkenness , or increase the consumption of distilled liquors , is surely impossible  for they are now drunk without restraint  and therefore no restraint will be taken away : and since their price must be increased by a double duty , it may reasonably be conceived , that those who now spend all that they can gain by their labour in drunkenness , must be content with less than before , because they will have no more to spend  and what has hitherto enabled them to riot in debauchery will no longer be sufficient for the same purposes  the same excess will require more money , and more money can not be had .


I do not affirm , my lords , that the success of this bill is demonstrably certain  nor can I deny that many arguments have been alleged against it which can not easily be confuted  all that I can venture to assert is , that in my opinion , the reasons for the bill preponderate , not that those against it , are without weight .


Of this , at least , we are certain , that the bill can produce no ill consequences  and that if the experience of the ensuing year shall show it to be ineffectual , it may be amended in the next session by new provisions , which we shall be then more able to adjust for the benefit of the publick .


All laws , especially those which regard complicated and intricate affairs , have been perfected by degrees  experience has discovered those deficiencies which sagacity could not foresee , and the progress of human wisdom has been always slow .
To charge any scheme with imperfection , is only to allege that it is the production of men , of beings finite in their capacity , and liable to errour  nor do I see what can be recommended to such beings , more than what the government is now endeavouring to practise , that nothing should be done precipitately , and that experience should always be trusted rather than conjecture .


Lord LONSDALE next spoke to the effect following : -- My lords , the arguments of the noble lord have by no means influenced me to alter my opinion  nor do I now rise up to pronounce a recantation of any of my former assertions , but to explain one of them , which the noble lord has been pleased to controvert .


He observes , in opposition to my argument , that the distillery contributes to the consumption of the produce of our grounds , and , by consequence , to the advantage of those who possess them  but I , my lords , am inclined to believe that it produces a contrary effect , and that it hinders the consumption , even of that grain which is employed in it .


We may reasonably suppose , my lords , that they who now drink distilled liquors , would , if they were debarred from them , endeavour to obtain from ale and beer the same renovation of their vigour , and relaxation of their cares  and that , therefore , more ale would be brewed , as there would be more purchasers : if , therefore , the same quantity of malt , which is sufficient , when distilled , to produce intoxication , would , when brewed into ale , have the same effect , the consumption would still be the same , whether ale or spirits were in use  but it is certain , that the fourth part of the malt which is necessary to furnish ale for a debauch , will , when exalted in the still , be sufficient to satisfy the most greedy drunkard  and it is , therefore , evident , that he who drinks ale , consumes more barley by three parts in four than he who indulges , the use of spirits , supposing them both equally criminal in the excess of their enjoyments .


The noble lord has taken occasion to mention tobacco as an instance of the obstinacy with which the people persevere in a practice to which they are addicted .
Of the obstinacy of the people , my lords , I am sufficiently convinced  but hope that it will never be able to overpower the legislature , who ought to enforce their laws , and invigorate their efforts in proportion to the atrociousness of the corruption which they are endeavouring to extirpate : nor do I think so meanly of government , as to believe it unable to repress drunkenness or luxury , or in danger of being subverted in a contest about spirits or tobacco .


Tobacco , indeed , has not properly been produced as an instance  for I never heard , that however it may be disapproved by particular men , of whatever rank or abilities , it was prohibited by law  nor should I think any such prohibition necessary or reasonable  for tobacco , my lords , is not poison , like distilled spirits , nor is the use of it so much injurious to health , as offensive to delicacy .


The poisonous and destructive quality of these liquors is confessed by the noble lord , a confession with which I find it very difficult to reconcile his solicitude for the distillery  for when it is once granted , that spirits corrupt the mind , weaken the limbs , impair virtue , and shorten life , any arguments in favour of those who manufacture them come too late , since no advantage can be equivalent to the loss of honesty and life .
When the noble lord has urged that the distillery employs great numbers of hands , and , therefore , ought to be encouraged , may it not , upon his own concession , be replied , that those numbers are employed in murder , and that their trade ought , like that of other murderers , to be stopped ?
When he urges that much of our grain is consumed in the still , may we not answer , and answer irresistibly , that it is consumed by being turned into poison , instead of bread ?
And can a stronger argument be imagined for the suppression of this detestable business , than that it employs multitudes , and that it is gainful and extensive ?


Nor can I discover , my lords , how the care of preserving the distillery is consistent with the ends which the preamble in this bill declares to be proposed , or which the advocates for it appear to desire .
If the consumption of distilled spirits is to be hindered , how is the distillery to remain uninjured ?
If the trade of distilling is not to be impaired , what shall hinder the consumption of spirits ?
So far as this bill operates , the distillers must be impoverished by it  and if they may properly and justly suffer a small diminution of their profit for a small advantage to the publick , why will not a greater benefit be equivalent to a greater diminution ?


Nothing , my lords , is more apparent , than that the real design of this bill , however its defenders may endeavour to conceal it in the mist of sophistry , is to lay only such a tax as may increase the revenue  and that they have no desire of suppressing that vice which may be made useful to their private purpose , nor feel any regret to fill the exchequer by the slaughter of the people .


Lord AYLESFORD then rose up , and spoke to the following purpose : -- My lords , the noble lord who spoke last in defence of this new scheme , appears to have imbibed very strong prejudices in favour of the distillery , from which he finds it practicable to draw large sums for the support of the measures which have been already formed , and which he , therefore , considers as the most important and beneficial trade of the British nation .


It is not improbable , my lords , that in a short time all the provisions which have been made by the wisdom of our ancestors for the support of the woollen manufacture , will be transferred for the encouragement of the distillery , which appears to be at present the reigning favourite  for it is evident , that both manufactures can not subsist together , and that either must be continued by the ruin of the other .


Of these rivals , which is doomed to fall we may conjecture from the encomium just now bestowed upon the prudence of the commons , by whom the darling distillery has been so tenderly treated  yet that the trade , in which the bounty of nature has enabled us to excel all other nations of the world , may not be suffered to perish in silence , I will take this opportunity to declare , that this boasted prudence can , in my opinion , produce no other effects than poverty and ruin , private calamities , and general wickedness  that by encouraging drunkenness at the expense of trade , it will stop all the currents by which the gold of foreign nations has flowed upon us , and expose us to conquest and to slavery .


[ Thus ended this memorable debate .
The question being put , was determined in favour of the bill by 57 against 38 . ]
