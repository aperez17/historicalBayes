LOYAL EFFUSION by W. T. F. } 7a {

TERENCE .
Hail , glorious edifice , stupendous work !
God bless the Regent and the Duke of York !
Ye Muses !
by whose aid I cried down Fox , Grant me in Drury Lane a private box , Where I may loll , cry Bravo !
and profess The boundless powers of England 's glorious press  While Afric 's sons exclaim , from shore to shore , `` Quashee ma boo ! ''
- the slave-trade is no more !
In fair Arabia ( happy once , now stony , Since ruined by that arch apostate Boney ) , A Phoenix late was caught : the Arab host Long ponder'd - part would boil it , part would roast , But while they ponder , up the pot-lid flies , Fledged , beak'd , and claw'd , alive they see him rise To heaven , and caw defiance in the skies .
So Drury , first in roasting flames consumed , Then by old renters to hot water doom'd , By Wyatt 's } 8 { trowel patted , plump and sleek , Soars without wings , and caws without a beak .
Gallia 's stern despot shall in vain advance From Paris , the metropolis of France  By this day month the monster shall not gain A foot of land in Portugal or Spain .
See Wellington in Salamanca 's field Forces his favourite general to yield , Breaks through his lines , and leaves his boasted Marmont Expiring on the plain without his arm on  Madrid he enters at the cannon 's mouth , And then the villages still further south .
Base Buonaparte , fill'd with deadly ire , Sets , one by one , our playhouses on fire .
Some years ago he pounced with deadly glee on The Opera House , then burnt down the Pantheon  Nay , still unsated , in a coat of flames , Next at Millbank he cross'd the river Thames  Thy hatch , O Halfpenny !
} 9 { pass'd in a trice , Boil'd some black pitch , and burnt down Astley 's twice  Then buzzing on through ether with a vile hum , Turn'd to the left hand , fronting the Asylum , And burnt the Royal Circus in a hurry - ( 'T was call'd the Circus then , but now the Surrey ) .
Who burnt ( confound his soul ! )
the houses twain Of Covent Garden and of Drury Lane ?
} 10 { Who , while the British squadron lay off Cork , ( God bless the Regent and the Duke of York ! )
With a foul earthquake ravaged the Caraccas , And raised the price of dry goods and tobaccos ?
Who makes the quartern loaf and Luddites rise ?
Who fills the butchers ' shops with large blue flies ?
Who thought in flames St. James 's court to pinch ?
} 11 { Who burnt the wardrobe of poor Lady Finch ?
- Why he , who , forging for this isle a yoke , Reminds me of a line I lately spoke , `` The tree of freedom is the British oak . ''
Bless every man possess'd of aught to give  Long may Long Tylney Wellesley Long Pole live  } 12 { God bless the Army , bless their coats of scarlet , God bless the Navy , bless the Princess Charlotte  God bless the Guards , though worsted Gallia scoff  God bless their pig-tails , though they 're now cut off  And , oh !
in Downing Street should Old Nick revel , England 's prime minister , then bless the devil !
THE BABY 'S DEBUT } 13 { BY W. W. } 99 {


`` Thy lisping prattle and thy mincing gait .
All thy false mimic fooleries I hate  For thou art Folly 's counterfeit , and she Who is right foolish hath the better plea  Nature 's true Idiot I prefer to thee '' CUMBERLAND .
[ Spoken in the character of Nancy Lake , a girl eight years of age , who is drawn upon the stage in a child 's chaise by Samuel Hughes , her uncle 's porter . ]


My brother Jack was nine in May , } 14 { And I was eight on New-year 's - day  So in Kate Wilson 's shop Papa ( he 's my papa and Jack 's ) Bought me , last week , a doll of wax , And brother Jack a top .
Jack 's in the pouts , and this it is , - He thinks mine came to more than his  So to my drawer he goes , Takes out the doll , and , O , my stars !
He pokes her head between the bars , And melts off half her nose !
Quite cross , a bit of string I beg , And tie it to his peg-top 's peg , And bang , with might and main , Its head against the parlour-door : Off flies the head , and hits the floor , And breaks a window-pane .
This made him cry with rage and spite Well , let him cry , it serves him right .
A pretty thing , forsooth !
If he 's to melt , all scalding hot , Half my doll 's nose , and I am not To draw his peg-top 's tooth !
Aunt Hannah heard the window break , And cried , `` O naughty Nancy Lake , Thus to distress your aunt : No Drury-Lane for you to-day ! ''
And while papa said , `` Pooh , she may ! ''
Mamma said , `` No , she sha 'n' t ! ''
Well , after many a sad reproach , They got into a hackney coach , And trotted down the street .
I saw them go : one horse was blind , The tails of both hung down behind , Their shoes were on their feet .
The chaise in which poor brother Bill Used to be drawn to Pentonville , Stood in the lumber-room : I wiped the dust from off the top , While Molly mopp'd it with a mop , And brushed it with a broom .
My uncle 's porter , Samuel Hughes , Came in at six to black the shoes , ( I always talk to Sam :) So what does he , but takes , and drags Me in the chaise along the flags , And leaves me where I am .
My father 's walls are made of brick , But not so tall , and not so thick As these  and , goodness me !
My father 's beams are made of wood , But never , never half so good As those that now I see .
What a large floor !
't is like a town !
The carpet , when they lay it down , Wo n't hide it , I 'll be bound  And there 's a row of lamps !
- my eye How they do blaze !
I wonder why They keep them on the ground .
At first I caught hold of the wing , And kept away  but Mr. Thing - um bob , the prompter man , Gave with his hand my chaise a shove , And said , `` Go on , my pretty love  Speak to 'em , little Nan .
`` You 've only got to curtsey , whisp - er , hold your chin up , laugh , and lisp , And then you 're sure to take : I 've known the day when brats , not quite Thirteen , got fifty pounds a night  } 15 { Then why not Nancy Lake ? ''
But while I 'm speaking , where 's papa ?
And where 's my aunt ?
and where 's mamma ?
Where 's Jack ?
O , there they sit !
They smile , they nod  I 'll go my ways , And order round poor Billy 's chaise , To join them in the pit .
And now , good gentlefolks , I go To join mamma , and see the show  So , bidding you adieu , I curtsey , like a pretty miss , And if you 'll blow to me a kiss , I 'll blow a kiss to you .

AN ADDRESS WITHOUT A PHOENIX } 16 { - BY S. T. P. } 17 {


`` This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked . ''
What You Will .
What stately vision mocks my waking sense ?
Hence , dear delusion , sweet enchantment , hence !
Ha !
is it real ?
- can my doubts be vain ?
It is , it is , and Drury lives again !
Around each grateful veteran attends , Eager to rush and gratulate his friends , Friends whose kind looks , retraced with proud delight , Endear the past , and make the future bright : Yes , generous patrons , your returning smile Blesses our toils , and consecrates our pile .
When last we met , Fate 's unrelenting hand Already grasped the devastating brand  Slow crept the silent flame , ensnared its prize , Then burst resistless to the astonished skies .
The glowing walls , disrobed of scenic pride , In trembling conflict stemmed the burning tide , Till crackling , blazing , rocking to its fall , Down rushed the thundering roof , and buried all !
Where late the sister Muses sweetly sung , And raptured thousands on their music hung , Where Wit and Wisdom shone , by Beauty graced , Sat lonely Silence , empress of the waste  And still had reigned - but he , whose voice can raise More magic wonders than Amphion 's lays , Bade jarring bands with friendly zeal engage To rear the prostrate glories of the stage .
Up leaped the Muses at the potent spell , And Drury 's genius saw his temple swell  Worthy , we hope , the British Drama 's cause , Worthy of British arts , and YOUR applause .
Guided by you , our earnest aims presume To renovate the Drama with the dome  The scenes of Shakespeare and our bards of old With due observance splendidly unfold , Yet raise and foster with parental hand The living talent of our native land .
O !
may we still , to sense and nature true , Delight the many , nor offend the few .
Though varying tastes our changeful Drama claim , Still be its moral tendency the same , To win by precept , by example warn , To brand the front of Vice with pointed scorn , And Virtue 's smiling brows with votive wreaths adorn .
CUI BONO ?
- BY LORD B. } 18 { } 99 {


I .


Sated with home , of wife , of children tired , The restless soul is driven abroad to roam  } 19 { Sated abroad , all seen , yet nought admired , The restless soul is driven to ramble home  Sated with both , beneath new Drury 's dome The fiend Ennui awhile consents to pine , There growls , and curses , like a deadly Gnome , Scorning to view fantastic Columbine , Viewing with scorn and hate the nonsense of the Nine .
II .


Ye reckless dopes , who hither wend your way To gaze on puppets in a painted dome , Pursuing pastimes glittering to betray , Like falling stars in life 's eternal gloom , What seek ye here ?
Joy 's evanescent bloom ?
Woe 's me !
the brightest wreaths she ever gave Are but as flowers that decorate a tomb .
Man 's heart , the mournful urn o'er which they wave , Is sacred to despair , its pedestal the grave .
III .


Has life so little store of real woes , That here ye wend to taste fictitious grief ?
Or is it that from truth such anguish flows , Ye court the lying drama for relief ?
Long shall ye find the pang , the respite brief : Or if one tolerable page appears In folly 's volume , 't is the actor 's leaf , Who dries his own by drawing others ' tears , And , raising present mirth , makes glad his future years .
IV .


Albeit , how like Young Betty } 21 { doth he flee !
Light as the mote that daunceth in the beam , He liveth only in man 's present e ` e  His life a flash , his memory a dream , Oblivious down he drops in Lethe 's stream .
Yet what are they , the learned and the great ?
Awhile of longer wonderment the theme !
Who shall presume to prophesy THEIR date , Where nought is certain , save the uncertainty of fate ?
V .


This goodly pile , upheaved by Wyatt 's toil , Perchance than Holland 's edifice } 22 { more fleet , Again red Lemnos ' artisan may spoil : The fire-alarm and midnight drum may beat , And all bestrewed ysmoking at your feet !
Start ye ?
perchance Death 's angel may be sent Ere from the flaming temple ye retreat : And ye who met , on revel idlesse bent , May find , in pleasure 's fane , your grave and monument .
VI .


Your debts mount high - ye plunge in deeper waste  The tradesman duns - no warning voice ye hear  The plaintiff sues - to public shows ye haste  The bailiff threats - ye feel no idle fear .
Who can arrest your prodigal career ?
Who can keep down the levity of youth ?
What sound can startle age 's stubborn ear ?
Who can redeem from wretchedness and ruth Men true to falsehood 's voice , false to the voice of truth ?
VII .


To thee , blest saint !
who doffed thy skin to make The Smithfield rabble leap from theirs with joy , We dedicate the pile - arise !
awake !
- Knock down the Muses , wit and sense destroy Clear our new stage from reason 's dull alloy , Charm hobbling age , and tickle capering youth With cleaver , marrow-bone , and Tunbridge toy !
While , vibrating in unbelieving tooth , } 23 { Harps twang in Drury 's walls , and make her boards a booth .
VIII .


For what is Hamlet , but a hare in March ?
And what is Brutus , but a croaking owl ?
And what is Rolla ?
Cupid steeped in starch , Orlando 's helmet in Augustin 's cowl .
Shakespeare , how true thine adage `` fair is foul ! ''
To him whose soul is with fruition fraught , The song of Braham is an Irish howl , Thinking is but an idle waste of thought , And nought is everything , and everything is nought .
IX .


Sons of Parnassus !
whom I view above , Not laurel-crown'd , but clad in rusty black  Not spurring Pegasus through Tempe 's grove , But pacing Grub-street on a jaded hack  What reams of foolscap , while your brains ye rack , Ye mar to make again !
for sure , ere long , Condemn'd to tread the bard 's time-sanction'd track , Ye all shall join the bailiff-haunted throng , And reproduce , in rags , the rags ye blot in song .
X .


So fares the follower in the Muses ' train  He toils to starve , and only lives in death  We slight him , till our patronage is vain , Then round his skeleton a garland wreathe , And o'er his bones an empty requiem breathe - Oh !
with what tragic horror would he start ( Could he be conjured from the grave beneath ) To find the stage again a Thespian cart , And elephants and colts down trampling Shakespeare 's art !
XI .


Hence , pedant Nature !
with thy Grecian rules !
Centaurs ( not fabulous ) those rules efface  Back , sister Muses , to your native schools  Here booted grooms usurp Apollo 's place , Hoofs shame the boards that Garrick used to grace , The play of limbs succeeds the play of wit , Man yields the drama to the Hou ` yn 'm race , His prompter spurs , his licenser the bit , The stage a stable-yard , a jockey-club the pit .
XII .


Is it for these ye rear this proud abode ?
Is it for these your superstition seeks To build a temple worthy of a god , To laud a monkey , or to worship leeks ?
Then be the stage , to recompense your freaks , A motley chaos , jumbling age and ranks , Where Punch , the lignum-vitae Roscius , squeaks , And Wisdom weeps , and Folly plays his pranks , And moody Madness laughs and hugs the chain he clanks .
HAMPSHIRE FARMER 'S ADDRESS - BY W. C. } 99 {


TO THE SECRETARY OF THE MANAGING COMMITTEE OF DRURY-LANE PLAYHOUSE .
SIR ,


To the gewgaw fetters of RHYME ( invented by the monks to enslave the people ) I have a rooted objection .
I have therefore written an address for your Theatre in plain , homespun , yeoman 's prose  in the doing whereof I hope I am swayed by nothing but an INDEPENDENT wish to open the eyes of this gulled people , to prevent a repetition of the dramatic BAMBOOZLING they have hitherto laboured under .
If you like what I have done , and mean to make use of it , I do n't want any such ARISTOCRATIC reward as a piece of plate with two griffins sprawling upon it , or a DOG and a JACKASS fighting for a ha ` p ` worth of GILT GINGERBREAD , or any such Bartholomew-fair nonsense .
All I ask is that the door-keepers of your play-house may take all the SETS OF MY REGISTER } 24 { now on hand , and FORCE every body who enters your doors to buy one , giving afterwards a debtor and creditor account of what they have received , POST-PAID , and in due course remitting me the money and unsold Registers , CARRIAGE-PAID .


I am , c. W. C .
IN THE CHARACTER OF A HAMPSHIRE FARMER .


- `` Rabida qui concitus ira Implevit pariter ternis latratibus auras , Et sparsit virides spumis albentibus agrot . ''
- OVID .
MOST THINKING PEOPLE ,


When persons address an audience from the stage , it is usual , either in words or gesture , to say , `` Ladies and Gentlemen , your servant . ''
If I were base enough , mean enough , paltry enough , and BRUTE BEAST enough , to follow that fashion , I should tell two lies in a breath .
In the first place , you are NOT Ladies and Gentlemen , but I hope something better , that is to say , honest men and women  and in the next place , if you were ever so much ladies , and ever so much gentlemen , I am not , NOR EVER WILL BE , your humble servant .
You see me here , MOST THINKING PEOPLE , by mere chance .
I have not been within the doors of a play-house before for these ten years  nor , till that abominable custom of taking money at the doors is discontinued , will I ever sanction a theatre with my presence .
The stage-door is the only gate of FREEDOM in the whole edifice , and through that I made my way from Bagshaw 's } 25 { in Brydges Street , to accost you .
Look about you .
Are you not all comfortable ?
Nay , never slink , mun  speak out , if you are dissatisfied , and tell me so before I leave town .
You are now ( thanks to MR. WHITBREAD ) got into a large , comfortable house .
Not into a GIMCRACK-PALACE  not into a SOLOMON 'S TEMPLE  not into a frost-work of Brobdignag filigree  but into a plain , honest , homely , industrious , wholesome , BROWN BRICK PLAYHOUSE .
You have been struggling for independence and elbow-room these three years  and who gave it you ?
Who helped you out of Lilliput ?
Who routed you from a rat-hole five inches by four , to perch you in a palace ?
Again and again I answer , MR. WHITBREAD .
You might have sweltered in that place with the Greek name } 26 { till doomsday , and neither LORD CASTLEREAGH , MR. CANNING , no , nor the MARQUESS WELLESLEY , would have turned a trowel to help you out !
Remember that .
Never forget that .
Read it to your children , and to your children 's children !
And now , MOST THINKING PEOPLE , cast your eyes over my head to what the builder ( I beg his pardon , the architect ) calls the proscenium .
No motto , no slang , no popish Latin , to keep the people in the dark .
No veluti in speculum .
Nothing in the dead languages , properly so called , for they ought to die , ay and be DAMNED to boot !
The Covent Garden manager tried that , and a pretty business he made of it !
When a man says veluti in speculum , he is called a man of letters .
Very well , and is not a man who cries O. P. a man of letters too ?
You ran your O. P. against his veluti in speculum , and pray which beat ?
I prophesied that , though I never told any body .
I take it for granted , that every intelligent man , woman , and child , to whom I address myself , has stood severally and respectively in Little Russell Street , and cast their , his , her , and its eyes on the outside of this building before they paid their money to view the inside .
Look at the brick-work , ENGLISH AUDIENCE !
Look at the brick-work !
All plain and smooth like a quakers ' meeting .
None of your Egyptian pyramids , to entomb subscribers ' capitals .
No overgrown colonnades of stone , } 27 { like an alderman 's gouty legs in white cotton stockings , fit only to use as rammers for paving Tottenham Court Road .
This house is neither after the model of a temple in Athens , no , nor a TEMPLE in MOORFIELDS , but it is built to act English plays in : and , provided you have good scenery , dresses , and decorations , I daresay you would n't break your hearts if the outside were as plain as the pikestaff I used to carry when I was a sergeant .
Apropos , as the French valets say , who cut their masters ' throats } 28 { - apropos , a word about dresses .
You must , many of you , have seen what I have read a description of , Kemble and Mrs. Siddons in Macbeth , with more gold and silver plastered on their doublets than would have kept an honest family in butchers ' meat and flannel from year 's end to year 's end !
I am informed , ( now mind , I do not vouch for the fact ) , but I am informed that all such extravagant idleness is to be done away with here .
Lady Macbeth is to have a plain quilted petticoat , a cotton gown , and a MOB CAP ( as the court parasites call it  - it will be well for them if , one of these days , they do n't wear a mob cap - I mean a WHITE CAP , with a MOB to look at them )  and Macbeth is to appear in an honest yeoman 's drab coat , and a pair of black calamanco breeches .
Not SALAmanca  no , nor TALAVERA neither , my most Noble Marquess  but plain , honest , black calamanco stuff breeches .
This is right  this is as it should be .
MOST THINKING PEOPLE , I have heard you much abused .
There is not a compound in the language but is strung fifty in a rope , like onions , by the Morning Post , and hurled in your teeth .
You are called the mob  and when they have made you out to be the mob , you are called the SCUM of the people , and the DREGS of the people .
I should like to know how you can be both .
Take a basin of broth - not CHEAP SOUP , MR. WILBERFORCE - not soup for the poor , at a penny a quart , as your mixture of horses ' legs , brick-dust , and old shoes , was denominated - but plain , wholesome , patriotic beef or mutton broth  take this , examine it , and you will find - mind , I do n't vouch for the fact , but I am told - you will find the dregs at the bottom , and the scum at the top .
I will endeavour to explain this to you : England is a large EARTHENWARE PIPKIN  John Bull is the BEEF thrown into it  taxes are the HOT WATER he boils in  rotten boroughs are the FUEL that blazes under this same pipkin  parliament is the LADLE that stirs the hodge - podge , and sometimes - .
But , hold !
I do n't wish to pay MR. NEWMAN } 29 { a second visit .
I leave you better off than you have been this many a day : you have a good house over your head  you have beat the French in Spain  the harvest has turned out well  the comet keeps its distance  } 30 { and red slippers are hawked about in Constantinople for next to nothing  and for all this , AGAIN AND AGAIN I tell you , you are indebted to MR. WHITBREAD !!!


THE LIVING LUSTRES - BY T. M. } 31 { } 99 {


`` Jam te juvaverit Viros relinquere , Doctaeque conjugis Sinu quiescere . ''
SIR T. MORE .


I .


O why should our dull retrospective addresses Fall damp as wet blankets on Drury Lane fire ?
Away with blue devils , away with distresses , And give the gay spirit to sparkling desire !
II .


Let artists decide on the beauties of Drury , The richest to me is when woman is there  The question of houses I leave to the jury  The fairest to me is the house of the fair .
III .


When woman 's soft smile all our senses bewilders , And gilds , while it carves , her dear form on the heart , What need has New Drury of carvers and gilders ?
With Nature so bounteous , why call upon Art ?
IV .


How well would our actors attend to their duties , Our house save in oil , and our authors in wit , In lieu of you lamps , if a row of young beauties Glanced light from their eyes between us and the pit ?
V .


The apples that grew on the fruit-tree of knowledge By woman were pluck'd , and she still wears the prize , To tempt us in theatre , senate , or college - I mean the love-apples that bloom in the eyes .
VI .


There too is the lash which , all statutes controlling , Still governs the slaves that are made by the fair  For man is the pupil , who , while her eye 's rolling , Is lifted to rapture , or sunk in despair .
VII .


Bloom , Theatre , bloom , in the roseate blushes Of beauty illumed by a love-breathing smile !
And flourish , ye pillars , } 32 { as green as the rushes That pillow the nymphs of the Emerald Isle !
VIII .


For dear is the Emerald Isle of the ocean , Whose daughters are fair as the foam of the wave , Whose sons , unaccustom'd to rebel commotion , Tho ' joyous , are sober - tho ' peaceful , are brave .
IX .


The shamrock their olive , swore foe to a quarrel , Protects from the thunder and lightning of rows  Their sprig of shillelagh is nothing but laurel , Which flourishes rapidly over their brows .
X .


O !
soon shall they burst the tyrannical shackles Which each panting bosom indignantly names , Until not one goose at the capital cackles Against the grand question of Catholic claims .
XI .


And then shall each Paddy , who once on the Liffey Perchance held the helm of some mackerel-hoy , Hold the helm of the state , and dispense in a jiffy More fishes than ever he caught when a boy .
XII .


And those who now quit their hods , shovels , and barrows In crowds to the bar of some ale-house to flock , When bred to OUR bar shall be Gibbses and Garrows , Assume the silk gown , and discard the smock-frock .
XIII .


For Erin surpasses the daughters of Neptune , As Dian outshines each encircling star  And the spheres of the heavens could never have kept tune Till set to the music of Erin-go-bragh !

- `` Per audaces nova dithyrambos Verba devolvit numerisque fertur Lege solutis . ''
HORAT .
[ Spoken by a Glendoveer . ]


I am a blessed Glendoveer : } 34 { 'T is mine to speak , and yours to hear .
Midnight , } 35 { yet not a nose From Tower-hill to Piccadilly snored !
Midnight , yet not a nose From Indra drew the essence of repose !
See with what crimson fury , By Indra fann'd , the god of fire ascends the walls of Drury Tops of houses , blue with lead , Bend beneath the landlord 's tread .
Master and ` prentice , serving-man and lord , Nailor and tailor , Grazier and brazier , Through streets and alleys pour'd - All , all abroad to gaze , And wonder at the blaze .
Thick calf , fat foot , and slim knee , Mounted on roof and chimney , } 36 { The mighty roast , the mighty stew To see  As if the dismal view Were but to them a Brentford jubilee .
Vainly , all-radiant Surya , sire of Phaeton ( By Greeks call'd Apollo } 37 { ) , Hollow Sounds from thy harp proceed  Combustible as reed , The tongue of Vulcan licks thy wooden legs : From Drury 's top , dissever'd from thy pegs , Thou tumblest , Humblest , Where late thy bright effulgence shone on high  While , by thy somerset excited , fly Ten million Billion Sparks from the pit , to gem the sable sky .
Now come the men of fire to quench the fires : To Russell Street see Globe and Atlas run , Hope gallops first , and second Sun  On flying heel , See Hand-in-Hand O'ertake the band !
View with what glowing wheel He nicks Phoenix !
While Albion scampers from Bridge Street , Blackfriars - Drury Lane !
Drury Lane !
Drury Lane !
Drury Lane !
They shout and they bellow again and again .
All , all in vain !
Water turns steam  Each blazing beam Hisses defiance to the eddying spout : It seems but too plain that nothing can put it out !
Drury Lane !
Drury Lane !
See , Drury Lane expires !
Pent in by smoke-dried beams , twelve moons or more , Shorn of his ray , Surya in durance lay : The workmen heard him shout , But thought it would not pay To dig him out .
When lo !
terrific Yamen , lord of hell , Solemn as lead , Judge of the dead , Sworn foe to witticism , By men call'd criticism , Came passing by that way : Rise !
cried the fiend , behold a sight of gladness !
Behold the rival theatre !
I 've set O. P. at her , } 38 { Who , like a bull-dog bold , Growls and fastens on his hold .
The many-headed rabble roar in madness  Thy rival staggers : come and spy her Deep in the mud as thou art in the mire .
So saying , in his arms he caught the beaming one , And crossing Russell Street , He placed him on his feet ` Neath Covent Garden dome .
Sudden a sound , As of the bricklayers of Babel , rose : Horns , rattles , drums , tin trumpets , sheets of copper , Punches and slaps , thwacks of all sorts and sizes , From the knobb'd bludgeon to the taper switch , } 39 { Ran echoing round the walls  paper placards Blotted the lamps , boots brown with mud the benches  A sea of heads roll'd roaring in the pit  On paper wings O. P. 's Reclin'd in lettered ease  While shout and scoff , Ya !
ya !
off !
off !
Like thunderbolt on Surya 's ear-drum fell , And seemed to paint The savage oddities of Saint Bartholomew in hell .
Tears dimm'd the god of light - `` Bear me back , Yamen , from this hideous sight  Bear me back , Yamen , I grow sick , Oh !
bury me again in brick  Shall I on New Drury tremble , To be O. P.'d like Kemble ?
No , Better remain by rubbish guarded , Than thus hubbubish groan placarded  Bear me back , Yamen , bear me quick , And bury me again in brick . ''
Obedient Yamen Answered , `` Amen , '' And did As he was bid .
There lay the buried god , and Time Seemed to decree eternity of lime  But pity , like a dew-drop , gently prest Almighty Veeshnoo 's } 40 { adamantine breast : He , the preserver , ardent still To do whate'er he says he will , From South-hill wing'd his way , To raise the drooping lord of day .
All earthly spells the busy one o'erpower'd  He treats with men of all conditions , Poets and players , tradesmen and musicians  Nay , even ventures To attack the renters , Old and new : A list he gets Of claims and debts , And deems nought done , while aught remains to do .
Yamen beheld , and wither'd at the sight  Long had he aim'd the sunbeam to control , For light was hateful to his soul : `` Go on ! ''
cried the hellish one , yellow with spite , `` Go on ! ''
cried the hellish one , yellow with spleen , `` Thy toils of the morning , like Ithaca 's queen , I 'll toil to undo every night . ''
Ye sons of song , rejoice !
Veeshnoo has still'd the jarring elements , The spheres hymn music  Again the god of day Peeps forth with trembling ray , Wakes , from their humid caves , the sleeping Nine , And pours at intervals a strain divine .
`` I have an iron yet in the fire , '' cried Yamen  `` The vollied flame rides in my breath , My blast is elemental death  This hand shall tear your paper bonds to pieces  Ingross your deeds , assignments , leases , My breath shall every line erase Soon as I blow the blaze . ''
The lawyers are met at the Crown and Anchor , And Yamen 's visage grows blanker and blanker  The lawyers are met at the Anchor and Crown , And Yamen 's cheek is a russety brown : Veeshnoo , now thy work proceeds  The solicitor reads , And , merit of merit !
Red wax and green ferret Are fixed at the foot of the deeds !
Yamen beheld and shiver'd  His finger and thumb were cramp'd  His ear by the flea in 't was bitten , When he saw by the lawyer 's clerk written , Sealed and delivered , Being first duly stamped .
`` Now for my turn ! ''
the demon cries , and blows A blast of sulphur from his mouth and nose .
Ah !
bootless aim !
the critic fiend , Sagacious Yamen , judge of hell , Is judged in his turn  Parchment wo n't burn !
His schemes of vengeance are dissolved in air , Parchment wo n't tear !!
Is it not written in the Himakoot book ( That mighty Baly from Kehama took ) , `` Who blows on pounce Must the Swerga renounce ? ''
It is !
it is !
Yamen , thine hour is nigh : Like as an eagle claws an asp , Veeshnoo has caught him in his mighty grasp , And hurl'd him , in spite of his shrieks and his squalls , Whizzing aloft , like the Temple fountain , Three times as high as Meru mountain , Which is Ninety-nine times as high as St. Paul 's .
Descending , he twisted like Levy the Jew , } 41 { Who a durable grave meant To dig in the pavement Of Monument-yard : To earth by the laws of attraction he flew , And he fell , and he fell To the regions of hell  Nine centuries bounced he from cavern to rock , And his head , as he tumbled , went nickety-nock , Like a pebble in Carisbrook well .
Now Veeshnoo turn'd round to a capering varlet , Array'd in blue and white and scarlet , And cried , `` Oh !
brown of slipper as of hat !
Lend me , Harlequin , thy bat ! ''
He seized the wooden sword , and smote the earth  When lo !
upstarting into birth A fabric , gorgeous to behold , Outshone in elegance the old , And Veeshnoo saw , and cried , `` Hail , playhouse mine ! ''
Then , bending his head , to Surya he said , `` Soon as thy maiden sister Di Caps with her copper lid the dark blue sky , And through the fissures of her clouded fan Peeps at the naughty monster man .
Go mount yon edifice , And show thy steady face In renovated pride , More bright , more glorious than before ! ''
But ah !
coy Surya still felt a twinge , Still smarted from his former singe  And to Veeshnoo replied , In a tone rather gruff , `` No , thank you !
one tumble 's enough ! ''
DRURY 'S DIRGE } 42 { - BY LAURA MATILDA .

`` You praise our sires  but though they wrote with force , Their rhymes were vicious , and their diction coarse : We want their STRENGTH , agreed  but we atone For that , and more , by SWEETNESS all our own . ''
- GIFFORD .
I .


Balmy Zephyrs , lightly flitting , Shade me with your azure wing  On Parnassus ' summit sitting , Aid me , Clio , while I sing .
II .


Softly slept the dome of Drury O'er the empyreal crest , When Alecto 's sister-fury Softly slumb ` ring sunk to rest .
III .


Lo !
from Lemnos limping lamely , Lags the lowly Lord of Fire , Cytherea yielding tamely To the Cyclops dark and dire .
IV .


Clouds of amber , dreams of gladness , Dulcet joys and sports of youth , Soon must yield to haughty sadness  Mercy holds the veil to Truth .
V .


See Erostratus the second Fires again Diana 's fane  By the Fates from Orcus beckon'd , Clouds envelope Drury Lane .
VI .


Lurid smoke and frank suspicion Hand in hand reluctant dance : While the God fulfils his mission , Chivalry , resign thy lance .
VII .


Hark !
the engines blandly thunder , Fleecy clouds dishevell'd lie , And the firemen , mute with wonder , On the son of Saturn cry .
VIII .


See the bird of Ammon sailing , Perches on the engine 's peak , And , the Eagle firemen hailing , Soothes them with its bickering beak .
IX .


Juno saw , and mad with malice , Lost the prize that Paris gave : Jealousy 's ensanguined chalice Mantling pours the orient wave .
X .


Pan beheld Patroclus dying , Nox to Niobe was turn'd  From Busiris Bacchus flying , Saw his Semele inurn'd .
XI .


Thus fell Drury 's lofty glory , Levell'd with the shuddering stones  Mars , with tresses black and gory , Drinks the dew of pearly groans .
XII .


Hark !
what soft Eolian numbers Gem the blushes of the morn !
Break , Amphion , break your slumbers , Nature 's ringlets deck the thorn .
XIII .


Ha !
I hear the strain erratic Dimly glance from pole to pole  Raptures sweet and dreams ecstatic Fire my everlasting soul .
XIV .


Where is Cupid 's crimson motion ?
Billowy ecstasy of woe , Bear me straight , meandering ocean , Where the stagnant torrents flow .
XV .


Blood in every vein is gushing , Vixen vengeance lulls my heart : See , the Gorgon gang is rushing !
Never , never let us part !
A TALE OF DRURY LANE - BY W. S. } 44 { } 99 {


[ To be spoken by Mr. Kemble , in a suit of the Black Prince 's armour , borrowed from the Tower . ]


Survey this shield , all bossy bright - These cuisses twain behold !
Look on my form in armour dight Of steel inlaid with gold  My knees are stiff in iron buckles , Stiff spikes of steel protect my knuckles .
These once belong'd to sable prince , Who never did in battle wince  With valour tart as pungent quince , He slew the vaunting Gaul .
Rest there awhile , my bearded lance , While from green curtain I advance To yon foot-lights - no trivial dance , } 45 { And tell the town what sad mischance Did Drury Lane befall .
THE NIGHT .


On fair Augusta 's } 46 { towers and trees Flitted the silent midnight breeze , Curling the foliage as it pass'd , Which from the moon-tipp'd plumage cast A spangled light , like dancing spray , Then re-assumed its still array  When , as night 's lamp unclouded hung , And down its full effulgence flung , It shed such soft and balmy power That cot and castle , hall and bower , And spire and dome , and turret height , Appeared to slumber in the light .
From Henry 's chapel , Rufus ' hall , To Savoy , Temple , and St. Paul  From Knightsbridge , Pancras , Camden Town , To Redriffe , Shadwell , Horsleydown , No voice was heard , no eye unclosed , But all in deepest sleep reposed .
They might have thought , who gazed around Amid a silence so profound , It made the senses thrill , That 't was no place inhabited , But some vast city of the dead - All was so hush'd and still .
THE BURNING .


As Chaos , which , by heavenly doom , Had slept in everlasting gloom , Started with terror and surprise When light first flash'd upon her eyes - So London 's sons in nightcap woke , In bed-gown woke her dames  For shouts were heard ` mid fire and smoke , And twice ten hundred voices spoke - `` The playhouse is in flames ! ''
And , lo !
where Catherine Street extends , A fiery tail its lustre lends To every window-pane  Blushes each spout in Martlet Court , And Barbican , moth-eaten fort , And Covent Garden kennels sport A bright ensanguined drain  Meux 's new brewhouse shows the light , Rowland Hill 's Chapel , and the height Where Patent Shot they sell  The Tennis Court , so fair and tall , Partakes the ray , with Surgeons ' Hall , The Ticket-Porters ' House of Call , Old Bedlam , close by London Wall , } 47 { Wright 's shrimp and oyster shop withal , And Richardson 's Hotel .
Nor these alone , but far and wide , Across red Thames 's gleaming tide , To distant fields the blaze was borne , And daisy white and hoary thorn In borrow'd lustre seem'd to sham The rose or red sweet Wil-li-am .
To those who on the hills around Beheld the flames from Drury 's mound , As from a lofty altar rise , It seem'd that nations did conspire To offer to the god of fire Some vast , stupendous sacrifice !
The summon'd firemen woke at call , And hied them to their stations all : Starting from short and broken snooze , Each sought his pond ` rous hobnail'd shoes , But first his worsted hosen plied , Plush breeches next , in crimson dyed , His nether bulk embraced  Then jacket thick , of red or blue , Whose massy shoulder gave to view The badge of each respective crew , In tin or copper traced .
The engines thunder'd through the street , Fire-hook , pipe , bucket , all complete , And torches glared , and clattering feet Along the pavement paced .
And one , the leader of the band , From Charing Cross along the Strand , Like stag by beagles hunted hard , Ran till he stopp'd at Vin ` gar Yard .
} 48 { The burning badge his shoulder bore , The belt and oil-skin hat he wore , The cane he had , his men to bang , Show'd foreman of the British gang - His name was Higginbottom .
Now 'T is meet that I should tell you how The others came in view : The Hand-in-Hand the race begun , } 49 { Then came the Phoenix and the Sun , Th ' Exchange , where old insurers run , The Eagle , where the new  With these came Rumford , Bumford , Cole , Robins from Hockley in the Hole , Lawson and Dawson , cheek by jowl , Crump from St. Giles 's Pound : Whitford and Mitford join'd the train , Huggins and Muggins from Chick Lane , And Clutterbuck , who got a sprain Before the plug was found .
Hobson and Jobson did not sleep , But ah !
no trophy could they reap , For both were in the Donjon Keep Of Bridewell 's gloomy mound !
E'en Higginbottom now was posed , For sadder scene was ne'er disclosed Without , within , in hideous show , Devouring flames resistless glow , And blazing rafters downward go , And never halloo `` Heads below ! ''
Nor notice give at all .
The firemen terrified are slow To bid the pumping torrent flow , For fear the roof should fall .
Back , Robins , back !
Crump , stand aloof !
Whitford , keep near the walls !
Huggins , regard your own behoof , For , lo !
the blazing rocking roof Down , down in thunder falls !
An awful pause succeeds the stroke , And o'er the ruins volumed smoke , Rolling around its pitchy shroud , Conceal'd them from th ' astonish'd crowd .
At length the mist awhile was clear'd , When lo !
amid the wreck uprear'd , Gradual a moving head appear'd , And Eagle firemen knew 'T was Joseph Muggins , name revered , The foreman of their crew .
Loud shouted all in signs of woe , `` A Muggins !
to the rescue , ho ! ''
And pour'd the hissing tide : Meanwhile the Muggins fought amain , And strove and struggled all in vain , For , rallying but to fall again , He totter'd , sunk , and died !
Did none attempt , before he fell , To succour one they loved so well ?
Yes , Higginbottom did aspire ( His fireman 's soul was all on fire ) His brother chief to save  But ah !
his reckless generous ire Served but to abate his grave !
` Mid blazing beams and scalding streams .
Through fire and smoke he dauntless broke , Where Muggins broke before : But sulphry stench and boiling drench Destroying sight o'erwhelm'd him quite , He sunk to rise no more .
Still o'er his head , while fate he braved , His whizzing water-pipe he waved  `` Whitford and Mitford , ply your pumps , `` You , Clutterbuck , come stir your stumps , `` Why are you in such doleful dumps ?
`` A fireman , and afraid of bumps !
- `` What are they fear'd on ?
fools !
` od rot 'em ! ''
Were the last words of Higginbottom .
} 50 { THE REVIVAL .


Peace to his soul !
new prospects bloom , And toil rebuilds what fires consume !
Eat we and drink we , be our ditty , `` Joy to the managing committee ! ''
Eat we and drink we , join to rum Roast beef and pudding of the plum !
Forth from thy nook , John Horner , come , With bread of ginger brown thy thumb , For this is Drury 's gay day : Roll , roll thy hoop , and twirl thy tops , And buy , to glad thy smiling chops , Crisp parliament with lollypops , And fingers of the Lady .
Didst mark , how toil'd the busy train , From morn to eve , till Drury Lane Leap'd like a roebuck from the plain ?
Ropes rose and sunk , and rose again , And nimble workmen trod  To realise bold Wyatt 's plan Rush'd many a howling Irishman  Loud clatter'd many a porter-can , And many a ragamuffin clan With trowel and with hod .
Drury revives !
her rounded pate Is blue , is heavenly blue with slate  She `` wings the midway air '' elate , As magpie , crow , or chough  White paint her modish visage smears , Yellow and pointed are her ears , No pendent portico appears Dangling beneath , for Whitbread 's shears } 51 { Have cut the bauble off .
Yes , she exalts her stately head  And , but that solid bulk outspread Opposed you on your onward tread , And posts and pillars warranted That all was true that Wyatt said , You might have deemed her walls so thick Were not composed of stone or brick , But all a phantom , all a trick , Of brain disturb'd and fancy sick , So high she soars , so vast , so quick !
JOHNSON 'S GHOST .
} 52 {


[ Ghost of Dr. Johnson rises from trap-door P. S. , and Ghost of BOSWELL from trap-door O. P .
The latter bows respectfully to the House , and obsequiously to the Doctor 's Ghost , and retires . ]
DOCTOR 'S GHOST loquitur .


That which was organised by the moral ability of one has been executed by the physical efforts of many , and DRURY LANE THEATRE is now complete .
Of that part behind the curtain , which has not yet been destined to glow beneath the brush of the varnisher , or vibrate to the hammer of the carpenter , little is thought by the public , and little need be said by the committee .
Truth , however , is not to be sacrificed for the accommodation of either  and he who should pronounce that our edifice has received its final embellishment would be disseminating falsehood without incurring favour , and risking the disgrace of detection without participating the advantage of success .


Professions lavishly effused and parsimoniously verified are alike inconsistent with the precepts of innate rectitude and the practice of external policy : let it not then be conjectured that because we are unassuming , we are imbecile  that forbearance is any indication of despondency , or humility of demerit .
He that is the most assured of success will make the fewest appeals to favour , and where nothing is claimed that is undue , nothing that is due will be withheld .
A swelling opening is too often succeeded by an insignificant conclusion .
Parturient mountains have now produced muscipular abortions  and the auditor who compares incipient grandeur with final vulgarity is reminded of the pious hawkers of Constantinople , who solemnly perambulate her streets , exclaiming , `` In the name of the Prophet - figs ! ''


Of many who think themselves wise , and of some who are thought wise by others , the exertions are directed to the revival of mouldering and obscure dramas  to endeavours to exalt that which is now rare only because it was always worthless , and whose deterioration , while it condemned it to living obscurity , by a strange obliquity of moral perception constitutes its title to posthumous renown .
To embody the flying colours of folly , to arrest evanescence , to give to bubbles the globular consistency as well as form , to exhibit on the stage the piebald denizen of the stable , and the half-reasoning parent of combs , to display the brisk locomotion of Columbine , or the tortuous attitudinizing of Punch  - these are the occupations of others , whose ambition , limited to the applause of unintellectual fatuity , is too innocuous for the application of satire , and too humble for the incitement of jealousy .


Our refectory will be found to contain every species of fruit , from the cooling nectarine and luscious peach to the puny pippin and the noxious nut .
There Indolence may repose , and Inebriety revel  and the spruce apprentice , rushing in at second account , may there chatter with impunity  debarred , by a barrier of brick and mortar , from marring that scenic interest in others , which nature and education have disqualified him from comprehending himself .


Permanent stage-doors we have none .
That which is permanent can not be removed , for , if removed , it soon ceases to be permanent .
What stationary absurdity can vie with that ligneous barricado , which , decorated with frappant and tintinnabulant appendages , now serves as the entrance of the lowly cottage , and now as the exit of a lady 's bed-chamber  at one time insinuating plastic Harlequin into a butcher 's shop , and , at another , yawning , as a flood-gate , to precipitate the Cyprians of St. Giles 's into the embraces of Macheath ?
To elude this glaring absurdity , to give to each respective mansion the door which the carpenter would doubtless have given , we vary our portal with the varying scene , passing from deal to mahogany , and from mahogany to oak , as the opposite claims of cottage , palace , or castle may appear to require .


Amid the general hum of gratulation which flatters us in front , it is fit that some regard should be paid to the murmurs of despondence that assail us in the rear .
They , as I have elsewhere expressed it , `` who live to please , '' should not have their own pleasures entirely overlooked .
The children of Thespis are general in their censures of the architect , its having placed the locality of exit at such a distance from the oily irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of him who addresses you .
I am , cries the Queen of Terrors , robbed of my fair proportions .
When the king-killing Thane hints to the breathless auditory the murders he means to perpetrate , in the castle of Macduff , `` ere his purpose cool  '' so vast is the interval he has to travel before he can escape from the stage , that his purpose has even time to freeze .
Your condition , cries the Muse of Smiles , is hard , but it is cygnet 's down in comparison with mine .
The peerless peer of capers and congees } 53 { has laid it down as a rule , that the best good thing uttered by the morning visitor should conduct him rapidly to the doorway , last impressions vying in durability with first .
But when , on this boarded elongation , it falls to my lot to say a good thing , to ejaculate `` keep moving , '' or to chant `` hic hoc horum genitivo , '' many are the moments that must elapse ere I can hide myself from public vision in the recesses of O. P. or P. S .


To objections like these , captiously urged and querulously maintained , it is time that equity should conclusively reply .
Deviation from scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself for the consequences it generates .
Let the actor consider the line of exit as that line beyond which he should not soar in quest of spurious applause : let him reflect , that in proportion as he advances to the lamps , he recedes from nature  that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional charm from encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box  and that the bravura of Mandane may produce effect , although the throat of her who warbles it should not overhang the orchestra .
The Jove of the modern critical Olympus , Lord Mayor of the theatric sky , } 54 { has , ex cathedra , asserted that a natural actor looks upon the audience part of the theatre as the third side of the chamber he inhabits .
Surely , of the third wall thus fancifully erected , our actors should , by ridicule or reason , be withheld from knocking their heads against the stucco .


Time forcibly reminds me that all things which have a limit must be brought to a conclusion .
Let me , ere that conclusion arrives , recall to your recollection , that the pillars which rise on either side of me , blooming in virid antiquity , like two massy evergreens , had yet slumbered in their native quarry but for the ardent exertions of the individual who called them into life : to his never-slumbering talents you are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the Muses is calculated to afford .
If , in defiance of chaotic malevolence , the destroyer of the temple of Diana yet survives in the name of Erostratus , surely we may confidently predict that the rebuilder of the temple of Apollo will stand recorded to distant posterity in that of - SAMUEL WHITBREAD .

Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida sylvas .
- VIRGIL .


Scene draws , and discovers a Lady asleep on a couch .


Enter PHILANDER .


PHILANDER .


I .


Sobriety , cease to be sober , } 56 { Cease , Labour , to dig and to delve  All hail to this tenth of October , One thousand eight hundred and twelve !
} 57 { Ha !
whom do my peepers remark ?
'T is Hebe with Jupiter 's jug  O no , 't is the pride of the Park , Fair Lady Elizabeth Mugg .
II .


Why , beautiful nymph , do you close The curtain that fringes your eye ?
Why veil in the clouds of repose The sun that should brighten our sky ?
Perhaps jealous Venus has oiled Your hair with some opiate drug , Not choosing her charms should be foiled By Lady Elizabeth Mugg .
III .


But ah !
why awaken the blaze Those bright burning-glasses contain , Whose lens with concentrated rays Proved fatal to old Drury Lane ?
'T was all accidental , they cry , - Away with the flimsy humbug !
'T was fired by a flash from the eye Of Lady Elizabeth Mugg .
IV .


Thy glance can in us raise a flame , Then why should old Drury be free ?
Our doom and its doom are the same , Both subject to beauty 's decree .
No candles the workmen consumed When deep in the ruins they dug  Thy flash still their progress illumed , Sweet Lady Elizabeth Mugg .
V .


Thy face a rich fire-place displays : The mantel-piece marble - thy brows  Thine eyes are the bright beaming blaze  Thy bib , which no trespass allows , The fender 's tall barrier marks  Thy tippet 's the fire-quelling rug , Which serves to extinguish the sparks Of Lady Elizabeth Mugg .
VI .


The Countess a lily appears , Whose tresses the pearl-drops emboss  The Marchioness , blooming in years , A rose-bud enveloped in moss  But thou art the sweet passion-flower , For who would not slavery hug , To pass but one exquisite hour In the arms of Elizabeth Mugg ?
VII .


When at Court , or some Dowager 's rout , Her diamond aigrette meets our view , She looks like a glow-worm dressed out , Or tulips bespangled with dew .
Her two lips denied to man 's suit Are shared with her favourite Pug  What lord would not change with the brute , To live with Elizabeth Mugg ?
VIII .


Could the stage be a large vis-a-vis , Reserved for the polished and great , Where each happy lover might see The nymph he adores tete-a-tete  No longer I 'd gaze on the ground , And the load of despondency lug , For I 'd book myself all the year round To ride with the sweet Lady Mugg .
IX .


Yes , she in herself is a host , And if she were here all alone , Our house might nocturnally boast A bumper of fashion and ton .
Again should it burst in a blaze , In vain would they ply Congreve 's plug , } 57 { For nought could extinguish the rays From the glance of divine Lady Mugg .
X .


O could I as Harlequin frisk , And thou be my Columbine fair , My wand should with one magic whisk Transport us to Hanover Square : St. George 's should lend us its shrine , The parson his shoulders might shrug , But a licence should force him to join My hand in the hand of my Mugg .
XI .


Court-plaster the weapons should tip , By Cupid shot down from above , Which , cut into spots for thy lip , Should still barb the arrows of love .
The God who from others flies quick , With us should be slow as a slug  As close as a leech he should stick To me and Elizabeth Mugg .
XII .


For Time would , with us , ` stead of sand , Put filings of steel in his glass , To dry up the blots of his hand , And spangle life 's page as they pass .
Since all flesh is grass ere 't is hay , } 58 { O may I in clover live snug , And when old Time mows me away , Be stacked with defunct Lady Mugg !
FIRE AND ALE - BY M. G. L. } 58a { } 99 {


Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum .
- VIRGIL .


My palate is parched with Pierian thirst , Away to Parnassus I 'm beckoned  List , warriors and dames , while my lay is rehearsed , I sing of the singe of Miss Drury the first , And the birth of Miss Drury the second .
The Fire King , one day , rather amorous felt  He mounted his hot copper filly  His breeches and boots were of tin , and the belt Was made of cast iron , for fear it should melt With the heat of the copper colt 's belly .
Sure never was skin half so scalding as his !
When an infant 't was equally horrid  For the water , when he was baptized , gave a fizz , And bubbled and simmer'd and started off , whizz !
As soon as it sprinkled his forehead .
O !
then there was glitter and fire in each eye , For two living coals were the symbols  His teeth were calcined , and his tongue was so dry , It rattled against them , as though you should try To play the piano in thimbles .
From his nostrils a lava sulphureous flows , Which scorches wherever it lingers  A snivelling fellow he 's call'd by his foes , For he ca n't raise his paw up to blow his red nose For fear it should blister his fingers .
His wig is of flames curling over his head , Well powder'd with white smoking ashes  He drinks gunpowder tea , melted sugar of lead , Cream of tartar , and dines on hot spice gingerbread , Which black from the oven he gnashes .
Each fire-nymph his kiss from her countenance shields , 'Twould soon set her cheekbone a frying  He spit in the Tenter-Ground near Spital-fields , And the hole that it burnt , and the chalk that it yields Make a capital lime-kiln for drying .
When he open'd his mouth , out there issued a blast , ( Nota bene , I do not mean swearing , ) But the noise that it made , and the heat that it cast , I 've heard it from those who have seen it , surpass'd A shot manufactory flaring .
He blazed , and he blazed , as be gallop'd to snatch His bride , little dreaming of danger  His whip was a torch , and his spur was a match , And over the horse 's left eye was a patch , To keep it from burning the manger .
And who is the housemaid he means to enthral In his cinder-producing alliance ?
Tis Drury-Lane Playhouse , so wide and so tall , Who , like other combustible ladies , must fall , If she can not set sparks at defiance .
On his warming-pan kneepan he clattering roll'd , And the housemaid his hand would have taken , But his hand , like his passion , was too hot to hold , And she soon let it go , but her new ring of gold All melted , like butter or bacon !
Oh !
then she look'd sour , and indeed well she might , For Vinegar Yard was before her  But , spite of her shrieks , the ignipotent knight , Enrobing the maid in a flame of gas light , To the skies in a sky-rocket bore her .
Look !
look !
't is the Ale King , so stately and starch , Whose votaries scorn to be sober  He pops from his vat , like a cedar or larch  Brown-stout is his doublet , he hops in his march , And froths at the mouth in October .
His spear is a spigot , his shield is a bung  He taps where the housemaid no more is , When lo !
at his magical bidding , upsprung A second Miss Drury , tall , tidy , and young , And sported in loco sororis .
Back , lurid in air , for a second regale , The Cinder King , hot with desire , To Brydges Street hied  but the Monarch of Ale , With uplifted spigot and faucet , and pail , Thus chided the Monarch of Fire : `` Vile tyrant , beware of the ferment I brew  `` I rule the roast here , dash the wig o ' me !
`` If , spite of your marriage with Old Drury , you `` Come here with your tinderbox , courting the New `` I 'll have you indicted for bigamy ! ''
PLAYHOUSE MUSINGS - BY S. T. C. } 59 { } 99 {


Ille velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim Credebat libris  neque si male cesserat , usquam Decurrens alio , neque si bene .
HOR .
My pensive Public , wherefore look you sad ?
I had a grandmother , she kept a donkey To carry to the mart her crockery ware , And when that donkey look'd me in the face , His face was sad !
and you are sad , my Public !
Joy should be yours : this tenth day of October Again assembles us in Drury Lane .
Long wept my eye to see the timber planks That hid our ruins  many a day I cried , Ah me !
I fear they never will rebuild it !
Till on one eve , one joyful Monday eve , As along Charles Street I prepared to walk , Just at the corner , by the pastrycook 's , I heard a trowel tick against a brick .
I look'd me up , and straight a parapet Uprose at least seven inches o'er the planks .
Joy to thee , Drury !
to myself I said : He of Blackfriars ' Road , } 60 { who hymned thy downfall In loud Hosannahs , and who prophesied That flames , like those from prostrate Solyma , Would scorch the hand that ventured to rebuild thee , Has proved a lying prophet .
From that hour , As leisure offer'd , close to Mr. Spring 's Box-office door , I 've stood and eyed the builders .
They had a plan to render less their labours  Workmen in olden times would mount a ladder With hodded heads , but these stretch'd forth a pole From the wall 's pinnacle , they plac'd a pulley Athwart the pole , a rope athwart the pulley  To this a basket dangled  mortar and bricks Thus freighted , swung securely to the top , And in the empty basket workmen twain Precipitate , unhurt , accosted earth .
Oh !
't was a goodly sound , to hear the people Who watch'd the work , express their various thoughts !
While some believed it never would be finish'd , Some , on the contrary , believed it would .
I 've heard our front that faces Drury Lane Much criticised  they say 't is vulgar brick-work , A mimic manufactory of floor-cloth .
One of the morning papers wish'd that front Cemented like the front in Brydges Street  As it now looks , they call it Wyatt 's Mermaid , A handsome woman with a fish 's tail .
White is the steeple of St. Bride 's in Fleet Street  The Albion ( as its name denotes ) is white  Morgan and Saunders ' shop for chairs and tables Gleams like a snow-ball in the setting sun  White is Whitehall .
But not St. Bride 's in Fleet Street , The spotless Albion , Morgan , no , nor Saunders , Nor white Whitehall , is white as Drury 's face .
Oh , Mr. Whitbread !
} 61 { fie upon you , sir !
I think you should have built a colonnade  When tender Beauty , looking for her coach , Protrudes her gloveless hand , perceives the shower And draws the tippet closer round her throat , Perchance her coach stands half a dozen off , And , ere she mounts the step , the oozing mud Soaks through her pale kid slipper .
On the morrow She coughs at breakfast , and her gruff papa Cries , `` There you go !
this comes of playhouses ! ''
To build no portico is penny wise : Heaven grant it prove not in the end pound foolish !
Hail to thee , Drury !
Queen of Theatres !
What is the Regency in Tottenham Street , The Royal Amphitheatre of Arts , Astley 's , Olympic , or the Sans Pareil , Compared with thee ?
Yet when I view thee push'd Back from the narrow street that christened thee , I know not why they call thee Drury Lane .
Amid the freaks that modern fashion sanctions , It grieves me much to see live animals Brought on the stage .
Grimaldi has his rabbit , Laurent his cat , and Bradbury his pig  Fie on such tricks !
Johnson , the machinist Of former Drury , imitated life Quite to the life .
The Elephant its Blue Beard , Stuff'd by his hand , wound round his lithe proboscis , As spruce as he who roar'd in Padmanaba .
} 62 { Nought born on earth should die .
On hackney stands I reverence the coachman who cries `` Gee , '' And spares the lash .
When I behold a spider Prey on a fly , a magpie on a worm , Or view a butcher with horn-handled knife Slaughter a tender lamb as dead as mutton , Indeed , indeed , I 'm very , very sick !

With Drurys for sartin we 'll never have done , We 've built up another , and yet there 's but one  The old one was best , yet I 'd say , if I durst , The new one is better - the last is the first .

We 've many new houses , and some of them rum ones , But the newest of all is the new House of Commons  'T is a rickety sort of a bantling , I 'm told , It will die of old age when it 's seven years old .
Tol de rol , c. VIII .


As I do n't know on whom the election will fall , I move in return for returning them all  But for fear Mr. Speaker my meaning should miss , The house that I wish 'em to sit in is this .
Tol de rol , c.IX .


Let us cheer our great Commoner , but for whose aid We all should have gone with short commons to bed  And since he has saved all the fat from the fire , I move that the house be call'd Whitbread 's Entire .

Away , fond dupes !
who , smit with sacred lore , Mosaic dreams in Genesis explore , Doat with Copernicus , or darkling stray With Newton , Ptolemy , or Tycho Brahe !
To you I sing not , for I sing of truth , Primeval systems , and creation 's youth  Such as of old , with magic wisdom fraught , Inspired LUCRETIUS to the Latians taught .
I sing how casual bricks , in airy climb , Encounter'd casual cow-hair , casual lime  How rafters , borne through wondering clouds elate , Kiss'd in their slope blue elemental slate , Clasp'd solid beams in chance-directed fury , And gave to birth our renovated Drury .
Thee , son of Jove !
whose sceptre was confess'd , Where fair AEolia springs from Tethys ' breast  Thence on Olympus , ` mid celestials placed , GOD OF THE WINDS , and Ether 's boundless waste - Thee I invoke !
Oh PUFF my bold design , Prompt the bright thought , and swell th ' harmonious line Uphold my pinions , and my verse inspire With Winsor 's } 65 { patent gas , or wind of fire , In whose pure blaze thy embryo form enroll'd , The dark enlightens , and enchafes the cold .
But , while I court thy gifts , be mine to shun The deprecated prize Ulysses won  Who , sailing homeward from thy breezy shore , The prison'd winds in skins of parchment bore .
Speeds the fleet bark till o'er the billowy green The azure heights of Ithaca are seen  But while with favouring gales her way she wins , His curious comrades ope the mystic skins  When , lo !
the rescued winds , with boisterous sweep , Roar to the clouds and lash the rocking deep  Heaves the smote vessel in the howling blast , Splits the stretch'd sail , and cracks the tottering mast .
Launch'd on a plank , the buoyant hero rides Where ebon Afric stems the sable tides , While his duck'd comrades o'er the ocean fly , And sleep not in the whole skins they untie .
So , when to raise the wind some lawyer tries , Mysterious skins of parchment meet our eyes  On speeds the smiling suit - `` Pleas of our Lord The King '' shine sable on the wide record  Nods the prunella'd bar , attorneys smile , And syren jurors flatter to beguile  Till stript - nonsuited - he is doom'd to toss In legal shipwreck and redeemless loss !
Lucky if , like Ulysses , he can keep His head above the waters of the deep .
AEolian monarch !
Emperor of Puffs !
We modern sailors dread not thy rebuffs  See to thy golden shore promiscuous come Quacks for the lame , the blind , the deaf , the dumb  Fools are their bankers - a prolific line , And every mortal malady 's a mine .
Each sly Sangrado , with his poisonous pill , Flies to the printer 's devil with his bill , Whose Midas touch can gild his ass 's ears , And load a knave with folly 's rich arrears .
And lo !
a second miracle is thine , For sloe-juice water stands transformed to wine .
Where Day and Martin 's patent blacking roll'd , Burst from the vase Pactolian streams of gold  Laugh the sly wizards , glorying in their stealth , Quit the black art , and loll in lazy wealth .
See Britain 's Algerines , the lottery fry , Win annual tribute by the annual lie !
Aided by thee - but whither do I stray ?
- Court , city , borough , own thy sovereign sway  An age of puffs an age of gold succeeds , And windy bubbles are the spawn it breeds .
If such thy power , O hear the Muse 's prayer !
Swell thy loud lungs and wave thy wings of air  Spread , viewless giant , all thy arms of mist Like windmill-sails to bring the poet grist  As erst thy roaring son , with eddying gale , Whirl'd Orithyia from her native vale - So , while Lucretian wonders I rehearse , Augusta 's sons shall patronise my verse .
I sing of ATOMS , whose creative brain , With eddying impulse , built new Drury Lane  Not to the labours of subservient man , To no young Wyatt appertains the plan - We mortals stalk , like horses in a mill , Impassive media of atomic will  Ye stare !
then Truth 's broad talisman discern - 'T is demonstration speaks - attend , and learn !
From floating elements in chaos hurl'd , Self-form'd of atoms , sprang the infant world : No great FIRST CAUSE inspired the happy plot , But all was matter - and no matter what .
Atoms , attracted by some law occult , Settling in spheres , the globe was the result  Pure child of CHANCE , which still directs the ball , As rotatory atoms rise or fall .
In ether launch'd , the peopled bubble floats , A mass of particles and confluent motes , So nicely poised , that if one atom flings Its weight away , aloft the planet springs , And wings its course through realms of boundless space .
Outstripping comets in eccentric race Add but one atom more , it sinks outright Down to the realms of Tartarus and night .
What waters melt or scorching fires consume , In different forms their being re-assume : Hence can no change arise , except in name , For weight and substance ever are the same .
Thus with the flames that from old Drury rise Its elements primeval sought the skies  There pendulous to wait the happy hour When new attractions should restore their power : So , in this procreant theatre elate , Echoes unborn their future life await  Here embryo sounds in ether lie conceal'd , Like words in northern atmosphere congeal'd .
Here many a foetus laugh and half encore Clings to the roof , or creeps along the floor  By puffs concipient some in ether flit , And soar in bravos from the thundering pit  Some forth on ticket-nights } 66 { from tradesmen break , To mar the actor they design to make  While some this mortal life abortive miss , Crush'd by a groan , or strangled by a hiss .
So , when `` Dog 's - meat '' re-echoes through the streets , Rush sympathetic dogs from their retreats , Beam with bright blaze their supplicating eyes , Sink their hind-legs , ascend their joyful cries  Each , wild with hope , and maddening to prevail , Points the pleased ear , and wags the expectant tail .
Ye fallen bricks !
in Drury 's fire calcined , Since doom'd to slumber , couch'd upon the wind , Sweet was the hour , when , tempted by your freaks , Congenial trowels smooth'd your yellow cheeks .
Float dulcet serenades upon the ear , Bends every atom from its ruddy sphere , Twinkles each eye , and , peeping from its veil , Marks in the adverse crowd its destined male .
The oblong beauties clap their hands of grit , And brick-dust titterings on the breezes flit  Then down they rush in amatory race , Their dusty bridegrooms eager to embrace .
Some choose old lovers , some decide for new , But each , when fix'd , is to her station true .
Thus various bricks are made , as tastes invite - The red , the grey , the dingy , or the white .
Perhaps some half-baked rover , frank and free , To alien beauty bends the lawless knee , But of unhallow'd fascinations sick , Soon quite his Cyprian for his married brick  The Dido atom calls and scolds in vain , No crisp AEneas soothes the widow 's pain .
So in Cheapside , what time Aurora peeps , A mingled noise of dustmen , milk , and sweeps Falls on the housemaid 's ear : amazed she stands , Then opes the door with cinder-sabled hands , And `` Matches '' calls .
The dustman , bubbled flat , Thinks 't is for him and doffs his fan-tail'd hat  The milkman , whom her second cries assail , With sudden sink unyokes the clinking pail  Now louder grown , by turns she screams and weeps - Alas !
her screaming only brings the sweeps .
Sweeps but put out - she wants to raise a flame , And calls for matches , but 't is still the same .
Atoms and housemaids !
mark the moral true - If once ye go astray , no MATCH for you !
As atoms in one mass united mix , So bricks attraction feel for kindred bricks  Some in the cellar view , perchance , on high , Fair chimney chums on beds of mortar lie  Enamour'd of the sympathetic clod , Leaps the red bridegroom to the labourer 's hod : And up the ladder bears the workman , taught To think he bears the bricks - mistaken thought !
A proof behold !
if near the top they find The nymphs or broken-corner'd or unkind , Back to the base , `` resulting with a bound , '' } 67 { They bear their bleeding carriers to the ground !
So legends tell along the lofty hill Paced the twin heroes , gallant Jack and Jill  On trudged the Gemini to reach the rail That shields the well 's top from the expectant pail , When , ah !
Jack falls  and , rolling in the rear , Jill feels the attraction of his kindred sphere  Head over heels begins his toppling track , Throws sympathetic somersets with Jack , And at the mountain 's base bobs plump against him , whack !
Ye living atoms , who unconscious sit , Jumbled by chance in gallery , box , and pit , For you no Peter opes the fabled door , No churlish Charon plies the shadowy oar  Breathe but a space , and Boreas ' casual sweep Shall bear your scatter'd corses o'er the deep , To gorge the greedy elements , and mix With water , marl , and clay , and stones , and sticks  While , charged with fancied souls , sticks , stones , and clay Shall take your seats , and hiss or clap the play .
O happy age !
when convert Christians read No sacred writings but the Pagan creed - O happy age !
when , spurning Newton 's dreams , Our poets ' sons recite Lucretian themes , Abjure the idle systems of their youth , And turn again to atoms and to truth  - O happier still !
when England 's dauntless dames , Awed by no chaste alarms , no latent shames , The bard 's fourth book unblushingly peruse , And learn the rampant lessons of the stews !
All hail , Lucretius !
renovated sage !
Unfold the modest mystics of thy page  Return no more to thy sepulchral shelf , But live , kind bard - that I may live myself !
THEATRICAL ALARM-BELL - BY THE EDITOR OF THE M. P. } 68 { } 99 {


`` Bounce , Jupiter , bounce ! ''
- O'HARA .


LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ,


As it is now the universally-admitted , and indeed pretty-generally - suspected , aim of Mr. Whitbread and the infamous , bloodthirsty , and , in fact , illiberal faction to which he belongs , to burn to the ground this free and happy Protestant city , and establish himself in St. James 's Palace , his fellow committeemen have thought it their duty to watch the principles of a theatre built under his auspices .
The information they have received from an undoubted authority - particularly from an old fruit-woman who has turned king 's evidence , and whose name , for obvious reasons , we forbear to mention , though we have had it some weeks in our possession - has induced them to introduce various reforms - not such reforms as the vile faction clamour for , meaning thereby revolution , but such reforms as are necessary to preserve the glorious constitution of the only free , happy , and prosperous country now left upon the face of the earth .
From the valuable and authentic source above alluded to , we have learnt that a sanguinary plot has been formed by some United Irishmen , combined with a gang of Luddites , and a special committee sent over by the Pope at the instigation of the beastly Corsican fiend , for destroying all the loyal part of the audience on the anniversary of that deeply-to-be-abhorred-and-highly-to-be-blamed stratagem , the Gunpowder Plot , which falls this year on Thursday the fifth of November .
The whole is under the direction of a delegated committee of O. P. 's whose treasonable exploits at Covent Garden you all recollect , and all of whom would have been hung from the chandeliers at that time , but for the mistaken lenity of Government .
At a given signal , a well-known O. P. was to cry out from the gallery , `` Nosey !
Music ! ''
whereupon all the O. P. 's were to produce from their inside pockets a long pair of shears , edged with felt , to prevent their making any noise , manufactured expressly by a wretch at Birmingham , one of Mr. Brougham 's evidences , and now in custody .
With these they were to cut off the heads of all the loyal N. P. 's in the house , without distinction of sex or age .
At the signal , similarly given , of `` Throw him over ! ''
which it now appears always alluded to the overthrow of our never-sufficiently-enough-to-be - deeply-and-universally-to-be-venerated constitution , all the heads of the N. P. 's were to be thrown at the fiddlers , to prevent their appearing in evidence , or perhaps as a false and illiberal insinuation that they have no heads of their own .
All that we know of the further designs of these incendiaries is , that they are by-a - great-deal-too-much-too-horrible-to-be-mentioned .


The Manager has acted with his usual promptitude on this trying occasion .
He has contracted for 300 tons of gun powder , which are at this moment placed in a small barrel under the pit  and a descendant of Guy Faux , assisted by Col. Congreve , has undertaken to blow up the house , when necessary , in so novel and ingenious a manner , that every O. P. shall be annihilated , while not a whisker of the N. P. 's shall be singed .
This strikingly displays the advantages of loyalty and attachment to government .
Several other hints have been taken from the theatrical regulations of the not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account - to-be-universally-execrated monster Bonaparte .
A park of artillery , provided with chain-shot , is to be stationed on the stage , and play upon the audience , in case of any indication of misplaced applause or popular discontent ( which accounts for the large space between the curtain and the lamps )  and the public will participate our satisfaction in learning that the indecorous custom of standing up with the hat on is to be abolished , as the Bow-street officers are provided with daggers , and have orders to stab all such persons to the heart , and send their bodies to Surgeons ' Hall .
Gentlemen who cough are only to be slightly wounded .
Fruit-women bawling `` Bill of the Play ! ''
are to be forthwith shot , for which purpose soldiers will be stationed in the slips , and ball-cartridge is to be served out with the lemonade .
If any of the spectators happen to sneeze or spit , they are to be transported for life  and any person who is so tall as to prevent another seeing , is to be dragged out and sent on board the tender , or , by an instrument to be taken out of the pocket of Procrustes , to be forthwith cut shorter , either at the head or foot , according as his own convenience may dictate .


Thus , ladies and gentlemen , have the committee , through my medium , set forth the not-in-a-hurry-to-be-paralleled plan they have adopted for preserving order and decorum within the walls of their magnificent edifice .
Nor have they , while attentive to their own concerns , by any means overlooked those of the cities of London and Westminster .
Finding on enumeration that they have , with a with-two - hands-and-one-tongue-to be-applauded liberality , contracted for more gunpowder than they want , they have parted with the surplus to the mattock-carrying and hustings-hammering high-bailiff of Westminster , who has , with his own shovel , dug a large hole in the front of the parish-church of St. Paul , Covent Garden , that , upon the least symptom of ill-breeding in the mob at the general election , the whole of the market may be blown into the air .
This , ladies and gentlemen , may at first make provisions RISE , but we pledge the credit of our theatre that they will soon FALL again , and people be supplied , as usual , with vegetables , in the in-general-strewed-with-cabbage - stalks-but-on-Saturday-night-lighted-up-with-lamps market of Covent Garden .


I should expatiate more largely on the other advantages of the glorious constitution of these by-the-whole-of-Europe-envied realms , but I am called away to take an account of the ladies and other artificial flowers at a fashionable rout , of which a full and particular account will hereafter appear .
For the present , my fashionable intelligence is scanty , on account of the opening of Drury Lane  and the ladies and gentlemen who honour me will not be surprised to find nothing under my usual head !!


THE THEATRE - BY THE REV. G. C. } 68a { } 99 {


`` Nil intentatum nostri liquere poetae , Nec minimum meruere decus , veetigia Graeca Ausi deserere , et celebrare domestica facta . ''
HOR .
A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES .


If the following poem should be fortunate enough to be selected for the opening address , a few words of explanation may be deemed necessary , on my part , to avert invidious misrepresentation .
The animadversion I have thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning the orchestra will , I hope , give no lasting remorse to any of the gentlemen employed in the band .
It is to be desired that they would keep their instruments ready tuned , and strike off at once .
This would be an accommodation to many well-meaning persons who frequent the theatre , who , not being blest with the ear of St. Cecilia , mistake the tuning for the overture , and think the latter concluded before it is begun .


- `` One fiddle will Give , half-ashamed , a tiny flourish still , '' was originally written `` one hautboy will  '' but , having providentially been informed , when this poem was on the point of being sent off , that there is but one hautboy in the band , I averted the storm of popular and manageria indignation from the head of its blower : as it now stands , `` one fiddle '' among many , the faulty individual will , I hope , escape detection .
The story of the flying play-bill is calculated to expose a practice much too common , of pinning play - bills to the cushions insecurely , and frequently , I fear , not pinning them at all , if these lines save one play-bill only front the fate I have recorded , I shall not deem my labour ill employed .
The concluding episode of Patrick Jennings glances at the boorish fashion of wearing the hat in the one-shilling gallery .
Had Jennings thrust his between his feet at the commencement of the play , he might have leaned forward with impunity , and the catastrophe I relate would not have occurred .
The line of handkerchiefs formed to enable him to recover his loss , is purposely so crossed in texture and materials as to mislead the reader in respect to the real owner of any one of them : for , in the statistical view of life and manners which I occasionally present , my clerical profession has taught me how extremely improper it would be , by any allusion , however slight , to give any uneasiness , however trivial , to any individual , however foolish or wicked .

'T is sweet to view , from half-past five to six , Our long wax-candles , with short cotton wicks , Touch'd by the lamplighter 's Promethean art , Start into light , and make the lighter start  To see red Phoebus through the gallery-pane Tinge with his beam the beams of Drury Lane  While gradual parties fill our widen'd pit , And gape , and gaze , and wonder , ere they sit .
At first , while vacant seats give choice and ease , Distant or near , they settle where they please  But when the multitude contracts the span , And seats are rare , they settle where they can .
Now the full benches to late-comers doom No room for standing , miscall'd STANDING-ROOM .
Hark !
the check-taker moody silence breaks , And bawling `` Pit full ! ''
gives the check he takes  Yet onward still the gathering numbers cram , Contending crowders shout rise frequent damn , And all is bustle , squeeze , row , jabbering , and jam .
See to their desks Apollo 's sons repair - Swift rides the rosin o'er the horse 's hair In unison their various tones to tune , Murmurs the hautboy , growls the hoarse bassoon  In soft vibration sighs the whispering lute , Tang goes the harpsichord , too-too the flute , Brays the loud trumpet , squeaks the fiddle sharp , Winds the French horn , and twangs the tingling harp  Till , like great Jove , the leader , figuring in , Attunes to order the chaotic din .
Now all seems hush'd - but no , one fiddle will Give , half-ashamed , a tiny flourish still .
Foil'd in his crash , the leader of the clan Reproves with frowns the dilatory man : Then on his candlestick thrice taps his bow , Nods a new signal , and away they go .
Perchance , while pit and gallery cry `` Hats off ! ''
And awed Consumption checks his chided cough , Some giggling daughter of the Queen of Love Drops , reft of pin , her play-bill from above  Like Icarus , while laughing galleries clap , Soars , ducks , and dives in air the printed scrap  But , wiser far than he , combustion fears , And , as it flies , eludes the chandeliers  Till , sinking gradual , with repeated twirl , It settles , curling , on a fiddler 's curl , Who from his powder'd pate the intruder strikes , And , for mere malice , sticks it on the spikes .
Say , why these Babel strains from Babel tongues ?
Who 's that calls `` Silence ! ''
with such leathern lungs ?
He who , in quest of quiet , `` Silence ! ''
hoots , Is apt to make the hubbub he imputes .
What various swains our motley walls contain !
- Fashion from Moorfields , honour from Chick Lane  Bankers from Paper Buildings here resort , Bankrupts from Golden Square and Riches Court  From the Haymarket canting rogues in grain , Gulls from the Poultry , sots from Water Lane  The lottery-cormorant , the auction-shark , The full-price master , and the half-price clerk  Boys who long linger at the gallery-door , With pence twice five - they want but twopence more , Till some Samaritan the twopence spares , And sends them jumping up the gallery-stairs .
Critics we boast who ne'er their malice balk , But talk their minds - we wish they 'd mind their talk  Big-worded bullies , who by quarrels live - Who give the lie , and tell the lie they give  Jews from St. Mary Axe , } 69 { for jobs so wary , That for old clothes they 'd even axe St. Mary  And bucks with pockets empty as their pate , Lax in their gaiters , laxer in their gait  Who oft , when we our house lock up , carouse With tippling tipstaves in a lock-up house .
Yet here , as elsewhere , Chance can joy bestow , Where scowling Fortune seem'd to threaten woe .
John Richard William Alexander Dwyer Was footman to Justinian Stubbs , Esquire  But when John Dwyer listed in the Blues , Emanuel Jennings polish'd Stubbs 's shoes .
Emanuel Jennings brought his youngest boy Up as a corn-cutter - a safe employ  In Holywell Street , St. Pancras , he was bred ( At number twenty-seven , it is said ) , Facing the pump , and near the Granby 's Head : He would have bound him to some shop in town , But with a premium he could not come down .
Pat was the urchin 's name - a red-hair'd youth , Fonder of purl and skittle-grounds than truth .
Silence , ye gods !
to keep your tongues in awe , The Muse shall tell an accident she saw .
Pat Jennings in the upper gallery sat , But , leaning forward , Jennings lost his hat Down from the gallery the beaver flew , And spurn'd the one to settle in the two .
How shall he act ?
Pay at the gallery-door Two shillings for what cost , when new , but four ?
Or till half-price , to save his shilling , wait , And gain his hat again at half-past eight ?
Now , while his fears anticipate a thief , John Mullens whispers , '' Take my handkerchief . ''
`` Thank you , '' cries Pat  `` but one wo n't make a line . ''
`` Take mine , '' cried Wilson  and cried Stokes , `` Take mine . ''
A motley cable soon Pat Jennings ties , Where Spitalfields with real India vies .
Like Iris ' bow down darts the painted clue , Starr'd , striped , and spotted , yellow , red , and blue , Old calico , torn silk , and muslin new .
George Green below , with palpitating hand , Loops the last ` kerchief to the beaver 's band - Uproars the prize !
The youth , with joy unfeign'd , Regain'd the felt , and felt what he regain'd  While to the applauding galleries grateful Pat Made a low bow , and touch'd the ransom'd hat .

GENTLEMEN ,


Happening to be wool-gathering at the foot of Mount Parnassus , I was suddenly seized with a violent travestie in the head .
The first symptoms I felt were several triple rhymes floating about my brain , accompanied by a singing in my throat , which quickly communicated itself to the ears of everybody about me , and made me a burthen to my friends and a torment to Doctor Apollo  three of whose favourite servants - that is to say , Macbeth , his butcher  Mrs. Haller , his cook  and George Barnwell , his book-keeper - I waylaid in one of my fits of insanity , and mauled after a very frightful fashion .
In this woeful crisis , I accidentally heard of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit , which cures every disorder incident to Grub Street .
I send you inclosed a more detailed specimen of my case : if you could mould it into the shape of an address , to be said or sung on the first night of your performance , I have no doubt that I should feel the immediate effects of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit , of which they tell me one hiss is a dose .

Go , boy , and thy good mistress tell ( She knows that my purpose is cruel ) , I 'd thank her to tingle her bell As soon as she 's heated my gruel .
Go , get thee to bed and repose - To sit up so late is a scandal  But ere you have ta'en off your clothes , Be sure that you put out that candle .
Ri fol de rol tol de rol lol My stars , in the air here 's a knife !
I 'm sure it can not be a hum  I 'll catch at the handle , add 's life !
And then I shall not cut my thumb .
I 've got him !

Come , come , I 'm not fond of these jokes  This must be some blade of the brain - Those witches are given to hoax .
I 've one in my pocket , I know , My wife left on purpose behind her  She bought this of Teddy-high-ho , The poor Caledonian grinder .
I see thee again !
o'er thy middle Large drops of red blood now are spill'd , Just as much as to say , diddle diddle , Good Duncan , pray come and be kill'd .
It leads to his chamber , I swear  I tremble and quake every joint - No dog at the scent of a hare Ever yet made a cleverer point .
Ah , no !
't was a dagger of straw - Give me blinkers , to save me from starting  The knife that I thought that I saw Was nought but my eye , Betty Martin .
Now o'er this terrestrial hive A life paralytic is spread  For while the one half is alive , The other is sleepy and dead .
King Duncan , in grand majesty , Has got my state-bed for a snooze  I 've lent him my slippers , so I May certainly stand in his shoes .
Blow softly , ye murmuring gales !
Ye feet , rouse no echo in walking !
For though a dead man tells no tales , Dead walls are much given to talking .
This knife shall be in at the death - I 'll stick him , then off safely get !
Cries the world , this could not be Macbeth .
For he 'd ne'er stick at anything yet .
Hark , hark !

- THE STRANGER .

Who has e'er been at Drury must needs know the Stranger A wailing old Methodist , gloomy and wan , A husband suspicious - his wife acted Ranger , She took to her heels , and left poor Hypocon .
Her martial gallant swore that truth was a libel , That marriage was thraldom , elopement no sin  Quoth she , I remember the words of my Bible - My spouse is a Stranger , and I 'll take him in .
With my sentimentalibus lachrymae roar 'em , And pathos and bathos delightful to see  And chop and change ribs , a-la-mode Germanorum , And high diddle ho diddle , pop tweedle dee .
To keep up her dignity no longer rich enough , Where was her plate ?
- why , 't was laid on the shelf  Her land fuller 's earth , and her great riches kitchen-stuff - Dressing the dinner instead of herself .
No longer permitted in diamonds to sparkle , Now plain Mrs. Haller , of servants the dread , With a heart full of grief , and a pan full of charcoal , She lighted the company up to their bed .
Incensed at her flight , her poor Hubby in dudgeon Roam'd after his rib in a gig and a pout , Till , tired with his journey , the peevish curmudgeon Sat down and blubber'd just like a church-spout .
One day , on a bench as dejected and sad he laid , Hearing a squash , he cried , Damn it , what 's that ?
'T was a child of the count 's , in whose service lived Adelaide , Soused in the river , and squall'd like a cat .
Having drawn his young excellence up to the bank , it Appear'd that himself was all dripping , I swear  No wonder he soon became dry as a blanket , Exposed as he was to the count 's SON and HEIR .
Dear Sir , quoths the count , in reward of your valour , To show that my gratitude is not mere talk , You shall eat a beefsteak with my cook , Mrs. Haller , Cut from the rump with her own knife and fork .
Behold , now the count gave the Stranger a dinner , With gunpowder-tea , which you know brings a ball , And , thin as he was , that he might not glow thinner , He made of the Stranger no stranger at all .
At dinner fair Adelaide brought up a chicken - A bird that she never had met with before  But , seeing him , scream'd , and was carried off kicking , And he bang'd his nob ` gainst the opposite door .
To finish my tale without roundaboutation , Young master and missee besieged their papa  They sung a quartetto in grand blubberation - The Stranger cried Oh !
Mrs. Haller cried Ah !
Though pathos and sentiment largely are dealt in , I have no good moral to give in exchange  For though she , as a cook , might be given to melting , The Stranger 's behaviour was certainly strange , With this sentimentalibus lachrymae roar 'em , And pathos and bathos delightful to see , And chop and change ribs , a-la-mode Germanorum , And high diddle ho diddle , pop tweedle dee .

George Barnwell stood at the shop-door , A customer hoping to find , sir  His apron was hanging before , But the tail of his coat was behind , sir .
A lady , so painted and smart , Cried , Sir , I 've exhausted my stock o ' late  I 've got nothing left but a groat - Could you give me four penn ` orth of chocolate ?
Rum ti , c..
Her face was rouged up to the eyes , Which made her look prouder and prouder  His hair stood on end with surprise , And hers with pomatum and powder .
The business was soon understood  The lady , who wish'd to be more rich , Cries , Sweet sir , my name is Milwood , And I lodge at the Gunner 's in Shoreditch .
Rum ti , c..
Now nightly he stole out , good lack !
And into her lodging would pop , sir  And often forgot to come back , Leaving master to shut up the shop , sir .
Her beauty his wits did bereave - Determined to be quite the crack O , He lounged at the Adam and Eve , And call'd for his gin and tobacco .
Rum ti , c. And now - for the truth must be told , Though none of a ` prentice should speak ill - He stole from the till all the gold , And ate the lump-sugar and treacle .
In vain did his master exclaim , Dear George , do n't engage with that dragon  She 'll lead you to sorrow and shame , And leave you the devil a rag on .
Your rum ti , c..
In vain he entreats and implores The weak and incurable ninny , So kicks him at last out of doors , And Georgy soon spends his last guinea .
His uncle , whose generous purse Had often relieved him , as I know , Now finding him grow worse and worse , Refused to come down with the rhino .
Rum ti , c. Cried Milwood , whose cruel heart 's core Was so flinty that nothing could shock it , If ye mean to come here any more , Pray come with more cash in your pocket : Make Nunky surrender his dibs , Rub his pate with a pair of lead towels , Or stick a knife into his ribs - I 'll warrant he 'll then show some bowels .
Rum ti , c..
A pistol he got from his love - 'T was loaded with powder and bullet  He trudged off to Camberwell Grove , But wanted the courage to pull it .
There 's Nunky as fat as a hog , While I am as lean as a lizard  Here 's at you , you stingy old dog !
- And he whips a long knife in his gizzard .
Rum ti , c. All you who attend to my song , A terrible end of the farce shall see , If you join the inquisitive throng That follow'd poor George to the Marshalsea .
If Milwood were here , dash my wigs , Quoth he , I would pummel and lam her well  Had I stuck to my prunes and figs , I ne'er had stuck Nunky at Camberwell .
Rum ti , c..
Their bodies were never cut down  For granny relates with amazement , A witch bore 'em over the town , And hung them on Thorowgood 's casement , The neighbours , I 've heard the folks say , The miracle noisily brag on  And the shop is , to this very day , The sign of the George and the Dragon , Rum ti , c.

`` Rhymes the rudders are of verses , With which , like ships , they steer their courses . ''
HUDIBRAS .
Scene draws , and discovers PUNCH on a throne , surrounded by LEAR , LADY MACBETH , MACBETH , OTHELLO , GEORGE BARNWELL , HAMLET , GHOST , MACHEATH , JULIET , FRAIR , APOTHECARY , ROMEO , and FALSTAFF .
- PUNCH descends and addresses them in the following


RECITATIVE .


As manager of horses Mr. Merryman is , So I with you am master of the ceremonies - These grand rejoicings .
Let me see , how name ye 'em ?
- Oh , in Greek lingo 't is E-pi-thalamium .
October 's tenth it is : toss up each hat to-day , And celebrate with shouts our opening Saturday !
On this great night 't is settled by our manager , That we , to please great Johnny Bull , should plan a jeer , Dance a bang-up theatrical cotillion , And put on tuneful Pegasus a pillion  That every soul , whether or not a cough he has , May kick like Harlequin , and sing like Orpheus .
So come , ye pupils of Sir John Gallini , } 74 { Spin up a tetotum like Angiolini : } 75 { That John and Mrs. Bull , from ale and tea-houses , May shout huzza for Punch 's Apotheosis !
They dance and sing .


AIR , `` Sure such a day . ''
- TOM THUMB .


LEAR .


Dance , Regan !
dance , with Cordelia and Goneril - Down the middle , up again , poussette , and cross  Stop , Cordelia !
do not tread upon her heel , Regan feeds on coltsfoot , and kicks like a horse .
See , she twists her mutton fists like Molyneux or Beelzebub , And t ` other 's clack , who pats her back , is louder far than hell 's hubbub .
They tweak my nose , and round it goes - I fear they 'll break the ridge of it , Or leave it all just like Vauxhall , with only half the bridge of it .
} 76 { OMNES .


Round let us bound , for this is Punch 's holyday , Glory to Tomfoolery , huzza !
huzza !
LADY MACBETH .


I kill'd the king  my husband is a heavy dunce  He left the grooms unmassacred , then massacred the stud .
One loves long gloves  for mittens , like king 's evidence , Let truth with the fingers out , and wo n't hide blood .
MACBETH .


When spoonys on two knees implore the aid of sorcery , To suit their wicked purposes they quickly put the laws awry  With Adam I in wife may vie , for none could tell the use of her , Except to cheapen golden pippins hawk'd about by Lucifer .
OMNES .


Round let us bound , for this is Punch 's holyday , Glory to Tomfoolery , huzza !
huzza !
OTHELLO .


Wife , come to life , forgive what your black lover did , Spit the feathers from your mouth , and munch roast beef  Iago he may go and be toss'd in the coverlet That smother'd you , because you pawn'd my handkerchief .
GEORGE BARNWELL .


Why , neger , so eager about your rib immaculate ?
Milwood shows for hanging us they 've got an ugly knack o ' late  If on beauty ` stead of duty but one peeper bent he sees , Satan waits with Dolly baits to hook in us apprentices .
OMNES .


Round let us bound , for this is Punch 's holyday , Glory to Tomfoolery , huzza !
huzza !
HAMLET .


I 'm Hamlet in camlet  my ap and peri-helia The moon can fix , which lunatics makes sharp or flat .
I stuck by ill luck , enamour'd of Ophelia , Old Polony like a sausage , and exclaim'd , `` Rat , rat ! ''
GHOST .


Let Gertrude sup the poison'd cup - no more I 'll be an actor in Such sorry food , but drink home-brew'd of Whitbread 's manufacturing .
MACHEATH .


I 'll Polly it , and folly it , and dance it quite the dandy O  But as for tunes , I have but one , and that is Drops of Brandy O. OMNES .


Round let us bound , for this is Punch 's holyday , Glory to Tomfoolery , huzza !
huzza !
JULIET .


I 'm Juliet Capulet , who took a dose of hellebore - A hell-of-a-bore I found it to put on a pall .
FRIAR .


And I am the friar , who so corpulent a belly bore .


APOTHECARY .


And that is why poor skinny I have none at all .


ROMEO .


I 'm the resurrection-man , of buried bodies amorous .


FALSTAFF .


I 'm fagg'd to death , and out of breath , and am for quiet clamorous  For though my paunch is round and stanch , I ne'er begin to feel it ere I Feel that I have no stomach left for entertainment military .
OMNES .


Round let us bound , for this is Punch 's holyday , Glory to Tomfoolery , huzza !
huzza !
