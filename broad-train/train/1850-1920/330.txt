PROLOGUE


SPOKEN BY MR. TREE IN THE CHARACTER OF BEAU AUSTIN


` To all and singular , ' as Dryden says , We bring a fancy of those Georgian days , Whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume Of old-world courtliness and old-world bloom : When speech was elegant and talk was fit For slang had not been canonised as wit  When manners reigned , when breeding had the wall , And Women - yes !
- were ladies first of all  When Grace was conscious of its gracefulness , And man - though Man !
- was not ashamed to dress .
A brave formality , a measured ease , Were his - and her 's - whose effort was to please .
And to excel in pleasing was to reign And , if you sighed , never to sigh in vain .
But then , as now - it may be , something more - Woman and man were human to the core .
The hearts that throbbed behind that quaint attire Burned with a plenitude of essential fire .
They too could risk , they also could rebel , They could love wisely - they could love too well .
In that great duel of Sex , that ancient strife Which is the very central fact of life , They could - and did - engage it breath for breath , They could - and did - get wounded unto death .
As at all times since time for us began Woman was truly woman , man was man , And joy and sorrow were as much at home In trifling Tunbridge as in mighty Rome .
Dead - dead and done with !
Swift from shine to shade The roaring generations flit and fade .
To this one , fading , flitting , like the rest , We come to proffer - be it worst or best - A sketch , a shadow , of one brave old time  A hint of what it might have held sublime  A dream , an idyll , call it what you will , Of man still Man , and woman - Woman still !

ACT I .


The Stage represents Miss Foster 's apartments at the Wells .
Doors , L. and C.  a window , L. C. , looking on the street  a table R. , laid for breakfast .
SCENE I


BARBARA  to her MISS FOSTER


BARBARA ( OUT OF WINDOW ) .
Mr. Menteith !
Mr. Menteith !
Mr. Menteith !
- Drat his old head !
Will nothing make him hear ?
- Mr. Menteith !
MISS FOSTER ( ENTERING ) .
Barbara !
this is incredible : after all my lessons , to be leaning from the window , and calling ( for unless my ears deceived me , you were positively calling ! )
into the street .


BARBARA .
Well , madam , just wait until you hear who it was .
I declare it was much more for Miss Dorothy and yourself than for me  and if it was a little countrified , I had a good excuse .


MISS FOSTER .
Nonsense , child !
At least , who was it ?


BARBARA .
Miss Evelina , I was sure you would ask .
Well , what do you think ?
I was looking out of window at the barber 's opposite -


MISS FOSTER .
Of which I entirely disapprove -


BARBARA .
And first there came out two of the most beautiful - the Royal livery , madam !


MISS FOSTER .
Of course , of course : the Duke of York arrived last night .
I trust you did not hail the Duke 's footmen ?


BARBARA .
O no , madam , it was after they were gone .
Then , who should come out - but you 'll never guess !


MISS FOSTER .
I shall certainly not try .


BARBARA .
Mr. Menteith himself !


MISS FOSTER .
Why , child , I never heard of him .


BARBARA .
O madam , not the Beau 's own gentleman ?


MISS FOSTER .
Mr. Austin 's servant .
No ?
Is it possible ?
By that , George Austin must be here .


BARBARA .
No doubt of that , madam  they 're never far apart .
He came out feeling his chin , madam , so  and a packet of letters under his arm , so  and he had the Beau 's own walk to that degree you could n't tell his back from his master 's .


MISS FOSTER .
My dear Barbara , you too frequently forget yourself .
A young woman in your position must beware of levity .


BARBARA .
Madam , I know it  but la , what are you to make of me ?
Look at the time and trouble dear Miss Dorothy was always taking - she that trained up everybody - and see what 's come of it : Barbara Ridley I was , and Barbara Ridley I am  and I do n't do with fashionable ways - I ca n't do with them  and indeed , Miss Evelina , I do sometimes wish we were all back again on Edenside , and Mr. Anthony a boy again , and dear Miss Dorothy her old self , galloping the bay mare along the moor , and taking care of all of us as if she was our mother , bless her heart !


MISS FOSTER .
Miss Dorothy herself , child ?
Well , now you mention it , Tunbridge of late has scarcely seemed to suit her constitution .
She falls away , has not a word to throw at a dog , and is ridiculously pale .
Well , now Mr. Austin has returned , after six months of infidelity to the dear Wells , we shall all , I hope , be brightened up .
Has the mail come ?


BARBARA .
That it has , madam , and the sight of Mr. Menteith put it clean out of my head .
( WITH LETTERS . )
Four for you , Miss Evelina , two for me , and only one for Miss Dorothy .
Miss Dorothy seems quite neglected , does she not ?
Six months ago , it was a different story .


MISS FOSTER .
Well , and that 's true , Barbara , and I had not remarked it .
I must take her seriously to task .
No young lady in her position should neglect her correspondence .
( OPENING A LETTER . )
Here 's from that dear ridiculous boy , the Cornet , announcing his arrival for to-day .


BARBARA .
O madam , will he come in his red coat ?


MISS FOSTER .
I could not conceive him missing such a chance .
Youth , child , is always vain , and Mr. Anthony is unusually young .
BARBARA .
La , madam , he ca n't help that .


MISS FOSTER .
My child , I am not so sure .
Mr. Anthony is a great concern to me .
He was orphaned , to be sure , at ten years old  and ever since he has been only as it were his sister 's son .
Dorothy did everything for him : more indeed than I thought quite ladylike , but I suppose I begin to be old-fashioned .
See how she worked and slaved - yes , slaved !
- for him : teaching him herself , with what pains and patience she only could reveal , and learning that she might be able  and see what he is now : a gentleman , of course , but , to be frank , a very commonplace one : not what I had hoped of Dorothy 's brother  not what I had dreamed of the heir of two families - Musgrave and Foster , child !
Well , he may now meet Mr.Austin .
He requires a Mr. Austin to embellish and correct his manners .
( OPENING ANOTHER LETTER . )
Why , Barbara , Mr. John Scrope and Miss Kate Dacre are to be married !


BARBARA .
La , madam , how nice !


MISS FOSTER .
They are : As I 'm a sinful woman .
And when will you be married , Barbara ?
and when dear Dorothy ?
I hate to see old maids a-making .


BARBARA .
La , Miss Evelina , there 's no harm in an old maid .


MISS FOSTER .
You speak like a fool , child : sour grapes are all very well but it 's a woman 's business to be married .
As for Dorothy , she is five-and-twenty , and she breaks my heart .
Such a match , too !
Ten thousand to her fortune , the best blood in the north , a most advantageous person , all the graces , the finest sensibility , excellent judgment , the Foster walk  and all these to go positively a-begging !
The men seem stricken with blindness .
Why , child , when I came out ( and I was the dear girl 's image ! )
I had more swains at my feet in a fortnight than our Dorothy in - O , I can not fathom it : it must be the girl 's own fault .


BARBARA .
Why , madam , I did think it was a case with Mr. Austin .


MISS FOSTER .
With Mr. Austin ?
why , how very rustic !
The attentions of a gentleman like Mr. Austin , child , are not supposed to lead to matrimony .
He is a feature of society : an ornament : a personage : a private gentleman by birth , but a kind of king by habit and reputation .
What woman could he marry ?
Those to whom he might properly aspire are all too far below him .
I have known George Austin too long , child , and I understand that the very greatness of his success condemns him to remain unmarried .


BARBARA .
Sure , madam , that must be tiresome for him .


MISS FOSTER .
Some day , child , you will know better than to think so .
George Austin , as I conceive him , and as he is regarded by the world , is one of the triumphs of the other sex .
I walked my first minuet with him : I would n't tell you the year , child , for worlds  but it was soon after his famous rencounter with Colonel Villiers .
He had killed his man , he wore pink and silver , was most elegantly pale , and the most ravishing creature !


BARBARA .
Well , madam , I believe that : he is the most beautiful gentleman still .


SCENE II


To these , DOROTHY , L .


DOROTHY ( ENTERING ) .
Good-morning , aunt !
Is there anything for me ?
( SHE GOES EAGERLY TO TABLE , AND LOOKS AT LETTERS . )


MISS FOSTER .
Good-morrow , niece .
Breakfast , Barbara .


DOROTHY ( WITH LETTER UNOPENED ) .
Nothing .


MISS FOSTER .
And what do you call that , my dear ?
( SITTING . )
Is John Fenwick nobody ?
DOROTHY ( LOOKING AT LETTER . )
From John ?
O yes , so it is .
( LAYS DOWN LETTER UNOPENED , AND SITS TO BREAKFAST , BARBARA WAITING . )
MISS FOSTER ( TO BARBARA , WITH PLATE ) .
Thanks , child  now you may give me some tea .
Dolly , I must insist on your eating a good breakfast : I can not away with your pale cheeks and that Patience-on-a Monument kind of look .
( Toast , Barbara . )
At Edenside you ate and drank and looked like Hebe .
What have you done with your appetite ?


DOROTHY .
I do n't know , aunt , I 'm sure .


MISS FOSTER .
Then consider , please , and recover it as soon as you can : to a young lady in your position a good appetite is an attraction - almost a virtue .
Do you know that your brother arrives this morning ?


DOROTHY .
Dear Anthony !
Where is his letter , Aunt Evelina ?
I am pleased that he should leave London and its perils , if only for a day .


MISS FOSTER .
My dear , there are moments when you positively amaze .
( Barbara , some PATE , if you please ! )
I beg you not to be a prude .
All women , of course , are virtuous  but a prude is something I regard with abhorrence .
The Cornet is seeing life , which is exactly what he wanted .
You brought him up surprisingly well  I have always admired you for it  but let us admit - as women of the world , my dear - it was no upbringing for a man .
You and that fine solemn fellow , John Fenwick , led a life that was positively no better than the Middle Ages  and between the two of you , poor Anthony ( who , I am sure , was a most passive creature ! )
was so packed with principle and admonition that I vow and declare he reminded me of Issachar stooping between his two burdens .
It washigh time for him to be done with your apron-string , my dear : he has all his wild oats to sow  and that is an occupation which it is unwise to defer too long .
By the bye , have you heard the news ?
The Duke of York has done us a service for which I was unprepared .
( More tea , Barbara ! )
George Austin , bringing the prince in his train , is with us once more .


DOROTHY .
I knew he was coming .


MISS FOSTER .
You knew , child ?
and did not tell ?
You are a public criminal .


DOROTHY .
I did not think it mattered , Aunt Evelina .


MISS FOSTER .
O do not make-believe .
I am in love with him myself , and have been any time since Nelson and the Nile .
As for you , Dolly , since he went away six months ago , you have been positively in the megrims .
I shall date your loss of appetite from George Austin 's vanishing .
No , my dear , our family require entertainment : we must have wit about us , and beauty , and the BEL AIR .


BARBARA .
Well , Miss Dorothy , perhaps it 's out of my place : but I do hope Mr. Austin will come : I should love to have him see my necklace on .


DOROTHY .
Necklace ?
what necklace ?
Did he give you a necklace ?


BARBARA .
Yes , indeed , Miss , that he did : the very same day he drove you in his curricle to Penshurst .
You remember , Miss , I could n't go .


DOROTHY .
I remember .


MISS FOSTER .
And so do I. I had a touch of ... Foster in the blood : the family gout , dears !
... And you , you ungrateful nymph , had him a whole day to yourself , and not a word to tell me when you returned .


DOROTHY .
I remember .
( RISING . )
Is that the necklace , Barbara ?
It does not suit you .
Give it me .
BARBARA .
La , Miss Dorothy , I would n't for the world .


DOROTHY .
Come , give it me .
I want it .
Thank you : you shall have my birthday pearls instead .


MISS FOSTER .
Why , Dolly , I believe you 're jealous of the maid .
Foster , Foster : always a Foster trick to wear the willow in anger .


DOROTHY .
I do not think , madam , that I am of a jealous habit .


MISS FOSTER .
O , the personage is your excuse !
And I can tell you , child , that when George Austin was playing Florizel to the Duchess 's Perdita , all the maids in England fell a prey to green - eyed melancholy .
It was the TON , you see : not to pine for that Sylvander was to resign from good society .


DOROTHY .
Aunt Evelina , stop  I can not endure to hear you .
What is he after all but just Beau Austin ?
What has he done - with half a century of good health , what has he done that is either memorable or worthy ?
Diced and danced and set fashions  vanquished in a drawing-room , fought for a word  what else ?
As if these were the meaning of life !
Do not make me think so poorly of all of us women .
Sure , we can rise to admire a better kind of man than Mr. Austin .
We are not all to be snared with the eye , dear aunt  and those that are - O !
I know not whether I more hate or pity them .


MISS FOSTER .
You will give me leave , my niece : such talk is neither becoming in a young lady nor creditable to your understanding .
The world was made a great while before Miss Dorothy Musgrave  and you will do much better to ripen your opinions , and in the meantime read your letter , which I perceive you have not opened .
( DOROTHY OPENS AND READS LETTER . )
Barbara , child , you should not listen at table .


BARBARA .
Sure , madam , I hope I know my place .


MISS FOSTER .
Then do not do it again .


DOROTHY .
Poor John Fenwick !
he coming here !


MISS FOSTER .
Well , and why not ?
Dorothy , my darling child , you give me pain .
You never had but one chance , let me tell you pointedly : and that was John Fenwick .
If I were you , I would not let my vanity so blind me .
This is not the way to marry .


DOROTHY .
Dear aunt , I shall never marry .


MISS FOSTER .
A fiddlestick 's end !
every one must marry .
( RISING . )
Are you for the Pantiles ?
DOROTHY .
Not to-day , dear ,


MISS FOSTER .
Well , well !
have your wish , Dolorosa .
Barbara , attend and dress me .


SCENE III


DOROTHY


DOROTHY .
How she tortures me , poor aunt , my poor blind aunt  and I - I could break her heart with a word .
That she should see nothing , know nothing - there 's where it kills .
O , it is more than I can bear ... and yet , how much less than I deserve !
Mad girl , of what do I complain ?
that this dear innocent woman still believes me good , still pierces me to the soul with trustfulness .
Alas , and were it otherwise , were her dear eyes opened to the truth , what were left me but death ?
- He , too - she must still be praising him , and every word is a lash upon my conscience .
If I could die of my secret : if I could cease - but one moment cease - this living lie  if I could sleep and forget and be at rest !
- Poor John !
( READING THE LETTER ) he at least is guiltless  and yet for my fault he too must suffer , he too must bear part in my shame .
Poor John Fenwick !
Has he come back with the old story : with what might have been , perhaps , had we stayed by Edenside ?
Eden ?
yes , my Eden , from which I fell .
O my old north country , my old river - the river of my innocence , the old country of my hopes - how could I endure to look on you now ?
And how to meet John ?
- John , with the old love on his lips , the old , honest , innocent , faithful heart !
There was a Dorothy once who was not unfit to ride with him , her heart as light as his , her life as clear as the bright rivers we forded  he called her his Diana , he crowned her so with rowan .
Where is that Dorothy now ?
that Diana ?
she that was everything to John ?
For O , I did him good  I know I did him good  I will still believe I did him good : I made him honest and kind and a true man  alas , and could not guide myself !
And now , how will he despise me !
For he shall know  if I die , he shall know all  I could not live , and not be true with him .
( SHE TAKES OUT THE NECKLACE AND LOOKS AT IT . )
That he should have bought me from my maid !
George , George , that you should have stooped to this !
Basely as you have used me , this is the basest .
Perish the witness !
( SHE TREADS THE TRINKET UNDER FOOT . )
Break , break like my heart , break like my hopes , perish like my good name !


SCENE IV


To her , FENWICK , C .


FENWICK ( AFTER A PAUSE ) .
Is this how you receive me , Dorothy ?
Am I not welcome ?
- Shall I go then ?
DOROTHY ( RUNNING TO HIM , WITH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED ) .
O no , John , not for me .
( TURNING , AND POINTING TO THE NECKLACE . )
But you find me changed .


FENWICK ( WITH A MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE NECKLACE ) .
This ?


DOROTHY .
No , no , let it lie .
That is a trinket - broken .
But the old Dorothy is dead .


FENWICK .
Dead , dear ?
Not to me .


DOROTHY .
Dead to you - dead to all men .


FENWICK .
Dorothy , I loved you as a boy .
There is not a meadow on Edenside but is dear to me for your sake , not a cottage but recalls your goodness , not a rock nor a tree but brings back something of the best and brightest youth man ever had .
You were my teacher and my queen  I walked with you , I talked with you , I rode with you  I lived in your shadow  I saw with your eyes .
You will never know , dear Dorothy , what you were to the dull boy you bore with  you will never know with what romance you filled my life , with what devotion , with what tenderness and honour .
At night I lay awake and worshipped you  in my dreams I saw you , and you loved me  and you remember , when we told each other stories - you have not forgotten , dearest - that Princess Hawthorn that was still the heroine of mine : who was she ?
I was not bold enough to tell , but she was you !
You , my virgin huntress , my Diana , my queen .


DOROTHY .
O silence , silence - pity !


FENWICK .
No , dear  neither for your sake nor mine will I be silenced .
I have begun  I must go on and finish , and put fortune to the touch .
It was from you I learned honour , duty , piety , and love .
I am as you made me , and I exist but to reverence and serve you .
Why else have I come here , the length of England , my heart burning higher every mile , my very horse a clog to me ?
why , but to ask you for my wife ?
Dorothy , you will not deny me .


DOROTHY .
You have not asked me about this broken trinket ?


FENWICK .
Why should I ask ?
I love you .


DOROTHY .
Yet I must tell you .
Sit down .
( SHE PICKS UP THE NECKLACE , AND STANDS LOOKING AT IT .
THEN , BREAKING DOWN . )
O John , John , it 's long since I left home .
FENWICK .
Too long , dear love .
The very trees will welcome you .


DOROTHY .
Ay , John , but I no longer love you .
The old Dorothy is dead , God pardon her !


FENWICK .
Dorothy , who is the man ?


DOROTHY .
O poor Dorothy !
O poor dead Dorothy !
John , you found me breaking this : me , your Diana of the Fells , the Diana of your old romance by Edenside .
Diana - O what a name for me !
Do you see this trinket ?
It is a chapter in my life .
A chapter , do I say ?
my whole life , for there is none to follow .
John , you must bear with me , you must help me .
I have that to tell - there is a secret - I have a secret , John - O , for God 's sake , understand .
That Diana you revered - O John , John , you must never speak of love to me again .


FENWICK .
What do you say ?
How dare you ?


DOROTHY .
John , it is the truth .
Your Diana , even she , she whom you so believed in , she who so believed in herself , came out into the world only to be broken .
I met , here at the Wells , a man - why should I tell you his name ?
I met him , and I loved him .
My heart was all his own  yet he was not content with that : he must intrigue to catch me , he must bribe my maid with this .
( THROWS THE NECKLACE ON THE TABLE . )
Did he love me ?
Well , John , he said he did  and be it so !
He loved , he betrayed , and he has left me .


FENWICK .
Betrayed ?


DOROTHY .
Ay , even so  I was betrayed .
The fault was mine that I forgot our innocent youth , and your honest love .


FENWICK .
Dorothy , O Dorothy !


DOROTHY .
Yours is the pain  but , O John , think it is for your good .
Think in England how many true maids may be waiting for your love , how many that can bring you a whole heart , and be a noble mother to your children , while your poor Diana , at the first touch , has proved all frailty .
Go , go and be happy , and let me be patient .
I have sinned .


FENWICK .
By God , I 'll have his blood .


DOROTHY .
Stop !
I love him .
( BETWEEN FENWICK AND DOOR , C. )


FENWICK .
What do I care ?
I loved you too .
Little he thought of that , little either of you thought of that .
His blood - I 'll have his blood !


DOROTHY .
You shall never know his name .


FENWICK .
Know it ?
Do you think I can not guess ?
Do you think I had not heard he followed you .
Do you think I had not suffered - O suffered !
George Austin is the man .
Dear shall he pay it !


DOROTHY ( AT HIS FEET ) .
Pity me  spare me , spare your Dorothy !
I love him - love him - love him !


FENWICK .
Dorothy , you have robbed me of my happiness , and now you would rob me of my revenge .


DOROTHY .
I know it  and shall I ask , and you not grant ?


FENWICK ( RAISING HER ) .
No , Dorothy , you shall ask nothing , nothing in vain from me .
You ask his life  I give it you , as I would give you my soul  as I would give you my life , if I had any left .
My life is done  you have taken it .
Not a hope , not an end  not even revenge .
( HE SITS . )
Dorothy , you see your work .


DOROTHY .
O God , forgive me .


FENWICK .
Ay , Dorothy , He will , as I do .


DOROTHY .
As you do ?
Do you forgive me , John ?


FENWICK .
Ay , more than that , poor soul .
I said my life was done , I was wrong  I have still a duty .
It is not in vain you taught me  I shall still prove to you that it was not in vain .
You shall soon find that I am no backward friend .
Farewell .

Breakfast-table , L. , front .
Door , L .
The Beau is discovered at table , in dressing-grown , trifling with correspondence .
MENTEITH is frothing chocolate .


SCENE I


AUSTIN , MENTEITH


MENTEITH .
At the barber 's , Mr. George , I had the pleasure of meeting two of the Dook 's gentlemen .


AUSTIN .
Well , and was his Royal Highness satisfied with his quarters ?


MENTEITH .
Quite so , Mr. George .
Delighted , I believe .


AUSTIN .
I am rejoiced to hear it .
I wish I could say I was as pleased with my journey , Menteith .
This is the first time I ever came to the Wells in another person 's carriage  Duke or not , it shall be the last , Menteith .


MENTEITH .
Ah , Mr. George , no wonder .
And how many times have we made that journey back and forth ?


AUSTIN .
Enough to make us older than we look .


MENTEITH .
To be sure , Mr. George , you do wear well .


AUSTIN .
WE wear well , Menteith .


MENTEITH .
I hear , Mr. George , that Miss Musgrave is of the company .


AUSTIN .
Is she so ?
Well , well !
well , well !


MENTEITH .
I 've not seen the young lady myself , Mr. George  but the barber tells me she 's looking poorly .


AUSTIN .
Poorly ?


MENTEITH .
Yes , Mr. George , poorly was his word .


AUSTIN .
Well , Menteith , I am truly sorry .
She is not the first .


MENTEITH .
Yes , Mr. George .
( A BELL .
MENTEITH GOES OUT , AND RE - ENTERS WITH CARD . )
AUSTIN ( WITH CARD ) .
Whom have we here ?
Anthony Musgrave ?


MENTEITH .
A fine young man , Mr. George  and with a look of the young lady , but not so gentlemanly .


AUSTIN .
You have an eye , you have an eye .
Let him in .


SCENE II


AUSTIN , MENTEITH , ANTHONY


AUSTIN .
I am charmed to have this opportunity , Mr. Musgrave .
You belong to my old corps , I think ?
And how does my good friend , Sir Frederick ?
I had his line  but like all my old comrades , he thinks last about himself , and gives me not of his news .


ANTHONY .
I protest , sir , this is a very proud moment .
Your name is still remembered in the regiment .
( AUSTIN BOWS . )
The Colonel - he keeps his health , sir , considering his age ( AUSTIN BOWS AGAIN , AND LOOKS AT MENTEITH ) - tells us young men you were a devil of a fellow in your time .


AUSTIN .
I believe I was - in my time .
Menteith , give Mr. Musgrave a dish of chocolate .
So , sir , we see you at the Wells .
ANTHONY .
I have but just alighted .
I had but one thought , sir : to pay my respects to Mr. Austin .
I have not yet kissed my aunt and sister .


AUSTIN .
In my time - to which you refer - the ladies had come first .


ANTHONY .
The women ?
I take you , sir .
But then you see , a man 's relatives do n't count .
And besides , Mr. Austin , between men of the world , I am fairly running away from the sex : I am positively in flight .
Little Hortense of the Opera  you know  she sent her love to you .
She 's mad about me , I think .
You never saw a creature so fond .


AUSTIN .
Well , well , child !
you are better here .
In my time - to which you have referred - I knew the lady .
Does she wear well ?


ANTHONY .
I beg your pardon , sir !


AUSTIN .
No offence , child , no offence .
She was a very lively creature .
But you neglect your chocolate I see ?


ANTHONY .
We do n't patronise it , Mr. Austin  we have n't for some years : the service has quite changed since your time .
You 'd be surprised .


AUSTIN .
Doubtless .
I am .


ANTHONY .
I assure you , sir , I and Jack Bosbury of the Fifty-Second - AUSTIN .
The Hampshire Bosburys ?
-


ANTHONY .
I do not know exactly , sir .
I believe he is related .


AUSTIN .
Or perhaps - I remember a Mr. Bosbury , a cutter of coats .
I have the vanity to believe I formed his business .


ANTHONY .
I - I hope not , sir .
But as I was saying , I and this Jack Bosbury , and the Brummagem Bantam - a very pretty light - weight , sir - drank seven bottles of Burgundy to the three of us inside the eighty minutes .
Jack , sir , was a little cut  but me and the Bantam went out and finished the evening on hot gin .
Life , sir , life !
Tom Cribb was with us .
He spoke of you , too , Tom did : said you 'd given him a wrinkle for his second fight with the black man .
No , sir , I assure you , you 're not forgotten .


AUSTIN ( BOWS ) .
I am pleased to learn it .
In my time , I had an esteem for Mr. Cribb .


ANTHONY .
O come , sir !
but your time can not be said to be over .


AUSTIN .
Menteith , you hear ?


MENTEITH .
Yes , Mr. George .


ANTHONY .
The Colonel told me that you liked to shake an elbow .
Your big main , sir , with Lord Wensleydale , is often talked about .
I hope I may have the occasion to sit down with you .
I shall count it an honour , I assure you .
AUSTIN .
But would your aunt , my very good friend , approve ?


ANTHONY .
Why , sir , you do not suppose I am in leading-strings ?


AUSTIN .
You forget , child : a family must hang together .
When I was young - in my time - I was alone  and what I did concerned myself .
But a youth who has - as I think you have - a family of ladies to protect , must watch his honour , child , and preserve his fortune .
You have no commands from Sir Frederick ?


ANTHONY .
None , sir , none .


AUSTIN .
Shall I find you this noon upon the Pantiles ?
... I shall be charmed .
Commend me to your aunt and your fair sister .
Menteith ?


MENTEITH .
Yes , Mr. George .
( SHOWS ANTHONY OUT . )


SCENE III


AUSTIN , MENTEITH , RETURNING


AUSTIN .
Was I ever like that , Menteith ?


MENTEITH .
No , Mr. George , you was always a gentleman .


AUSTIN .
Youth , my good fellow , youth .


MENTEITH .
Quite so , Mr. George .


AUSTIN .
Well , Menteith , we can not make no mend .
We can not play the jockey with Time .
Age is the test : of wine , Menteith , and men .


MENTEITH .
Me and you and the old Hermitage , Mr. George , he-he !


AUSTIN .
And the best of these , the Hermitage .
But come : we lose our day .
Help me off with this .
( MENTEITH TAKES OFF AUSTIN 'S DRESSING-GOWN  AUSTIN PASSES R. TO DRESSING-TABLE , AND TAKES UP FIRST CRAVAT . )
AUSTIN .
Will the hair do , Menteith ?


MENTEITH .
Never saw it lay better , Mr. George .

Fenwick ?
of Allonby Shaw ?
A good family , Menteith , but I do n't know the gentleman .
( LAYS DOWN CARD , AND TAKES UP THIRD CRAVAT . )
Send him away with every consideration .
MENTEITH .
To be sure , Mr. George .
( HE GOES OUT .
THIRD CRAVAT A SUCCESS .

He says , Mr. George , that he has an errand from Miss Musgrave .


AUSTIN ( WITH WAISTCOAT ) .
Show him in , Menteith , at once .

SCENE IV


AUSTIN , R. TO HIM MENTEITH AND FENWICK


MENTEITH ( ANNOUNCING ) .
Mr. Fenwick , Mr. George .


AUSTIN .
At the name of Miss Musgrave , my doors fly always open .


FENWICK .
I believe , sir , you are acquainted with my cousin , Richard Gaunt ?
AUSTIN .
The county member ?
An old and good friend .
But you need not go so far afield : I know your good house of Allonby Shaw since the days of the Black Knight .
We are , in fact , and at a very royal distance , cousins .


FENWICK .
I desired , sir , from the nature of my business , that you should recognise me for a gentleman .


AUSTIN .
The preliminary , sir , is somewhat grave .


FENWICK .
My business is both grave and delicate .


AUSTIN .
Menteith , my good fellow .
( EXIT MENTEITH . )
Mr. Fenwick , honour me so far as to be seated .
( THEY SIT . )
I await your pleasure .


FENWICK .
Briefly , sir , I am come , not without hope , to appeal to your good heart .


AUSTIN .
From Miss Musgrave ?


FENWICK .
No , sir , I abused her name , and am here upon my own authority .
Upon me the consequence .


AUSTIN .
Proceed .


FENWICK .
Mr. Austin , Dorothy Musgrave is the oldest and dearest of my friends , is the lady whom for ten years it has been my hope to make my wife .
She has shown me reason to discard that hope for another : that I may call her Mrs. Austin .


AUSTIN .
In the best interests of the lady ( RISING ) I question if you have been well inspired .
You are aware , sir , that from such interference there is but one issue : to whom shall I address my friend ?


FENWICK .
Mr. Austin , I am here to throw myself upon your mercy .
Strange as my errand is , it will seem yet more strange to you that I came prepared to accept at your hands any extremity of dishonour and not fight .
The lady whom it is my boast to serve has honoured me with her commands .
These are my law , and by these your life is sacred .


AUSTIN .
Then , sir ( WITH HIS HAND UPON THE BELL ) , his conversation becomes impossible .
You have me at too gross a disadvantage  and , as you are a gentleman and respect another , I would suggest that you retire .


FENWICK .
Sir , you speak of disadvantage  think of mine .
All my life long , with all the forces of my nature , I have loved this lady .
I came here to implore her to be my wife , to be my queen  my saint she had been always !
She was too noble to deceive me .
She told me what you know .
I will not conceal that my first mood wasof anger : I would have killed you like a dog .
But , Mr. Austin - bear with me awhile - I , on the threshold of my life , who have made no figure in the world , nor ever shall now , who had but one treasure , and have lost it - if I , abandoning revenge , trampling upon jealousy , can supplicate you to complete my misfortune - O Mr. Austin !
you who have lived , you whose gallantry is beyond the insolence of a suspicion , you who are a man crowned and acclaimed , who are loved , and loved by such a woman - you who excel me in every point of advantage , will you suffer me to surpass you in generosity ?


AUSTIN .
You speak from the heart .
( SITS . )
What do you want with me ?


FENWICK .
Marry her .


AUSTIN .
Mr. Fenwick , I am the older man .
I have seen much of life , much of society , much of love .
When I was young , it was expected of a gentleman to be ready with his hat to a lady , ready with his sword to a man  to honour his word and his king  to be courteous with his equals , generous to his dependants , helpful and trusty in friendship .
But it was not asked of us to be quixotic .
If I had married every lady by whom it is my fortune - not my merit - to have been distinguished , the Wells would scarce be spacious enough for my establishment .
You see , sir , that while I respect your emotion , I am myself conducted by experience .
And besides , Mr. Fenwick , is not love a warfare ?
has it not rules ?
have not our fair antagonists their tactics , their weapons , their place of arms ?
and is there not a touch of - pardon me the word !
of silliness in one who , having fought , and having vanquished , sounds a parley , and capitulates to his own prisoner ?
Had the lady chosen , had the fortune of war been other , 't is like she had been Mrs. Austin .
Now I ... You know the world .


FENWICK .
I know , sir , that the world contains much cowardice .
To find Mr. Austin afraid to do the right , this surprises me .
AUSTIN .
Afraid , child ?


FENWICK .
Yes , sir , afraid .
You know her , you know if she be worthy  and you answer me with - the world : the world which has been at your feet : the world which Mr. Austin knows so well how to value and is so able to rule .


AUSTIN .
I have lived long enough , Mr. Fenwick , to recognise that the world is a great power .
It can make  but it can break .


FENWICK .
Sir , suffer me : you spoke but now of friendship , and spoke warmly .
Have you forgotten Colonel Villiers ?


AUSTIN .
Mr. Fenwick , Mr. Fenwick , you forget what I have suffered .


FENWICK .
O sir , I know you loved him .
And yet , for a random word you quarrelled  friendship was weighed in vain against the world 's code of honour  you fought , and your friend fell .
I have heard from others how he lay long in agony , and how you watched and nursed him , and it was in your embrace he died .
In God 's name have you forgotten that ?
Was not this sacrifice enough ?
or must the world , once again , step between Mr. Austin and his generous heart ?


AUSTIN .
Good God , sir , I believe you are in the right  I believe , upon my soul I believe , there is something in what you say .


FENWICK .
Something , Mr. Austin ?
O credit me , the whole difference betwixt good and evil .


AUSTIN .
Nay , nay , but there you go too far .
There are many kinds of good : honour is a diamond cut in a thousand facets , and with the true fire in each .
Thus , and with all our differences , Mr. Fenwick , you and I can still respect , we can still admire each other .


FENWICK .
Bear with me still , sir , if I ask you what is the end of life but to excel in generosity ?
To pity the weak , to comfort the afflicted , to right where we have wronged , to be brave in reparation - these noble elements you have  for of what besides is the fabric of your dealing with Colonel Villiers ?
That is man 's chivalry to man .
Yet to a suffering woman - a woman feeble , betrayed , unconsoled - you deny your clemency , you refuse your aid , you proffer injustice for atonement .
Nay , you are so disloyal to yourself that you can choose to be ungenerous and unkind .
Where , sir , is the honour ?
What facet of the diamond is that ?


AUSTIN .
You forget , sir , you forget .
But go on .


FENWICK .
O sir , not I - not I but yourself forgets : George Austin forgets George Austin .
A woman loved by him , betrayed by him , abandoned by him - that woman suffers  and a point of honour keeps him from his place at her feet .
She has played and lost , and the world is with him if he deign to exact the stakes .
Is that the Mr. Austin whom Miss Musgrave honoured with her trust ?
Then , sir , how miserably was she deceived !


AUSTIN .
Child - child -


FENWICK .
Mr. Austin , still bear with me , still follow me .
O sir , will you not picture that dear lady 's life ?
Her years how few , her error thus irreparable , what henceforth can be her portion but remorse , the consciousness of self-abasement , the shame of knowing that her trust was ill-bestowed ?
To think of it : this was a queen among women  and this - this is George Austin 's work !
Sir , let me touch your heart : let me prevail with you to feel that 't is impossible .


AUSTIN .
I am a gentleman .
What do you ask of me ?


FENWICK .
To be the man she loved : to be clement where the world would have you triumph , to be of equal generosity with the vanquished , to be worthy of her sacrifice and of yourself .


AUSTIN .
Mr. Fenwick , your reproof is harsh -


FENWICK ( INTERRUPTING HIM ) .
O sir , be , just be just !
-


AUSTIN .
But it is merited , and I thank you for its utterance .
You tell me that the true victory comes when the fight is won : that our foe is never so noble nor so dangerous as when she is fallen , that the crowning triumph is that we celebrate over our conquering selves .
Sir , you are right .
Kindness , ay kindness after all .
And with age , to become clement .
Yes , ambition first  then , the rounded vanity - victory still novel  and last , as you say , the royal mood of the mature man  to abdicate for others ... Sir , you touched me hard about my dead friend  still harder about my living duty  and I am not so young but I can take a lesson .
There is my hand upon it : she shall be my wife .


FENWICK .
Ah , Mr. Austin , I was sure of it .


AUSTIN .
Then , sir , you were vastly mistaken .
There is nothing of Beau Austin here .
I have simply , my dear child , sate at the feet of Mr. Fenwick .


FENWICK .
Ah , sir , your heart was counsellor enough .


AUSTIN .
Pardon me .
I am vain enough to be the judge : there are but two people in the world who could have wrought this change : yourself and that dear lady .
( TOUCHES BELL . )
Suffer me to dismiss you .
One instant of toilet , and I follow .
Will you do me the honour to go before , and announce my approach ?
( ENTER MENTEITH . )


FENWICK .
Sir , if my admiration -


AUSTIN .
Dear child , the admiration is the other way .
( EMBRACES HIM .
MENTEITH SHOWS HIM OUT . )
SCENE V


AUSTIN


AUSTIN .
Upon my word , I think the world is getting better .
We were none of us young men like that - in my time , to quote my future brother .
( HE SITS DOWN BEFORE THE MIRROR . )
Well , here ends Beau Austin .
Paris , Rome , Vienna , London - victor everywhere : and now he must leave his bones in Tunbridge Wells .
( LOOKS AT HIS LEG . )
Poor Dolly Musgrave !
a good girl after all , and will make me a good wife  none better .
The last - of how many ?
- ay , and the best !
Walks like Hebe .
But still , here ends Beau Austin .
Perhaps it 's time .
Poor Dolly - was she looking poorly ?
She shall have her wish .
Well , we grow older , but we grow no worse .


SCENE VI


AUSTIN , MENTEITH


AUSTIN .
Menteith , I am going to be married .


MENTEITH .
Well , Mr. George , but I am pleased to hear it .
Miss Musgrave is a most elegant lady .
AUSTIN .
Ay , Mr. Menteith ?
and who told you the lady 's name ?


MENTEITH .
Mr. George , you was always a gentleman .


AUSTIN .
You mean I was n't always ?
Old boy , you are in the right .
This shall be a good change for both you and me .
We have lived too long like a brace of truants : now is the time to draw about the fire .
How much is left of the old Hermitage ?


MENTEITH .
Hard upon thirty dozen , Mr. George , and not a bad cork in the bin .


AUSTIN .
And a mistress , Menteith , that 's worthy of that wine .


MENTEITH .
Mr. George , sir , she 's worthy of you .


AUSTIN .
Gad , I believe it .
( SHAKES HANDS WITH HIM . )


MENTEITH ( BREAKING DOWN ) .
Mr. George , you 've been a damned good master to me , and I 've been a damned good servant to you  we 've been proud of each other from the first  but if you 'll excuse my plainness , Mr. George , I never liked you better than to-day .


AUSTIN .
Cheer up , old boy , the best is yet to come .
Get out the tongs , and curl me like a bridegroom .

MUSICAL INDUCTION : the ` Minuet ' from ` DON GIOVANNI '


ACT III .


The stage represents Miss Foster 's lodging as in Act I .


SCENE I


DOROTHY , R. , at tambour  ANTHONY , C. , bestriding chair  MISS FOSTER , L.C. ANTHONY .
Yes , ma'am , I like my regiment : we are all gentlemen , from old Fred downwards , and all of a good family .
Indeed , so are all my friends , except one tailor sort of fellow , Bosbury .
But I 'm done with him .
I assure you , Aunt Evelina , we are Corinthian to the last degree .
I would n't shock you ladies for the world -


MISS FOSTER .
Do n't mind me , my dear  go on .


ANTHONY .
Really , ma'am , you must pardon me : I trust I understand what topics are to be avoided among females - And before my sister , too !
A girl of her age !


DOROTHY .
Why , you dear , silly fellow , I 'm old enough to be your mother .


ANTHONY .
My dear Dolly , you do not understand  you are not a man of the world .
But , as I was going on to say , there is no more spicy regiment in the service .


MISS FOSTER .
I am not surprised that it maintains its old reputation .
You know , my dear ( TO DOROTHY ) , it was George Austin 's regiment .


DOROTHY .
Was it , aunt ?


ANTHONY .
Beau Austin ?
Yes , it was  and a precious dust they make about him still - a parcel of old frumps !
That 's why I went to see him .
But he 's quite extinct : he could n't be Corinthian if he tried .


MISS FOSTER .
I am afraid that even at your age George Austin held a very different position from the distinguished Anthony Musgrave .


ANTHONY .
Come , ma'am , I take that unkindly .
Of course I know what you 're at : of course the old put cut no end of a dash with the Duchess .


MISS FOSTER .
My dear child , I was thinking of no such thing  THAT was immoral .
ANTHONY .
Then you mean that affair at Brighton : when he cut the Prince about Perdita Robinson .
MISS FOSTER .
No , I had forgotten it .


ANTHONY .
O , well , I know - that duel !
But look here , Aunt Evelina , I do n't think you 'd be much gratified after all if I were to be broke for killing my commanding officer about a quarrel at cards .


DOROTHY .
Nobody asks you , Anthony , to imitate Mr. Austin .
I trust you will set yourself a better model .
But you may choose a worse .
With all his faults , and all his enemies , Mr. Austin is a pattern gentleman : You would not ask a man to be braver , and there are few so generous .
I can not bear to hear him called in fault by one so young .
Better judges , dear , are better pleased .


ANTHONY .
Hey-day !
what 's this ?


MISS FOSTER .
Why , Dolly , this is April and May .
You surprise me .


DOROTHY .
I am afraid , indeed , madam , that you have much to suffer from my caprice .
( SHE GOES OUT , L. )


SCENE II


ANTHONY , MISS FOSTER


ANTHONY .
What is the meaning of all this , ma'am ?
I do n't like it .


MISS FOSTER .
Nothing , child , that I know .
You spoke of Mr. Austin , our dear friend , like a groom  and she , like any lady of taste , took arms in his defence .


ANTHONY .
No , ma'am , that wo n't do .
I know the sex .
You mark my words , the girl has some confounded nonsense in her head , and wants looking after .


MISS FOSTER .
In my presence , Anthony , I shall ask you to speak of Dorothy with greater respect .
With your permission , your sister and I will continue to direct our own affairs .
When we require the interference of so young and confident a champion , you shall know .
( CURTSIES , KISSES HER HAND , AND GOES OUT , L. )


SCENE III


ANTHONY


ANTHONY .
Upon my word , I think Aunt Evelina one of the most uncivil old women in the world .
Nine weeks ago I came of age  and they still treat me like a boy .
I 'm a recognised Corinthian , too : take my liquor with old Fred , and go round with the Brummagem Bantam and Jack Bosb - ... O damn Jack Bosbury .
If his father was a tailor , he shall fight me for his ungentlemanly conduct .
However , that 's all one .
What I want is to make Aunt Evelina understand that I 'm not the man to be put down by an old maid who 's been brought up in a work-basket , begad !
I 've had nothing but rebuffs all day .
It 's very remarkable .
There was that man Austin , to begin with .
I 'll be hanged if I can stand him .
I hear too much of him  and if I can only get a good excuse to put him to the door , I believe it would give Dorothy and all of us a kind of a position .
After all , he 's not a man to visit in the house of ladies : not when I 'm away , at least .
Nothing in it of course  but is he a man whose visits I can sanction ?


SCENE IV


ANTHONY , BARBARA


BARBARA .
Please , Mr. Anthony , Miss Foster said I was to show your room .


ANTHONY .
Ha !
Baby ?
Now , you come here .
You 're a girl of sense , I know .


BARBARA .
La , Mr. Anthony , I hope I 'm nothing of the kind .


ANTHONY .
Come , come !
that 's not the tone I want : I 'm serious .
Does this man Austin come much about the house ?
BARBARA .
O Mr. Anthony , for shame !
Why do n't you ask Miss Foster ?
ANTHONY .
Now I wish you to understand : I 'm the head of this family .
It 's my business to look after my sister 's reputation , and my aunt 's too , begad !
That 's what I 'm here for : I 'm their natural protector .
And what I want you , Barbara Ridley , to understand - you whose fathers have served my fathers - is just simply this : if you 've any common gratitude , you 're bound to help me in the work .
Now Barbara , you know me , and you know my Aunt Evelina .
She 's a good enough woman  I 'm the first to say so .
But who is she to take care of a young girl ?
She 's ignorant of the world to that degree she believes in Beau Austin !
Now you and I , Bab , who are not so high and dry , see through and through him  we know that a man like that is no fit company for any inexperienced girl .


BARBARA .
O Mr. Anthony , do n't say that .
( WEEPING . )


ANTHONY .
Hullo !
what 's wrong ?


BARBARA .
Nothing that I know of .
O Mr. Anthony , I do n't think there can be anything .


ANTHONY .
Think ?
Do n't think ?
What 's this ?


BARBARA .
O sir !
I do n't know , and yet I do n't like it .
Here 's my beautiful necklace all broke to bits : she took it off my very neck , and gave me her birthday pearls instead  and I found it afterwards on the table , all smashed to pieces  and all she wanted it for was to take and break it .
Why that ?
It frightens me , Mr. Anthony , it frightens me .


ANTHONY ( WITH NECKLACE ) .
This ?
What has this trumpery to do with us ?


BARBARA .
He gave it me : that 's why she broke it .


ANTHONY .
He ?
who ?


BARBARA .
Mr. Austin did  and I do believe I should not have taken it , Mr. Anthony , but I thought no harm , upon my word of honour .
He was always here : that was six months ago  and indeed , indeed , I thought they were to marry .
How would I think else with a born lady like Miss Dorothy ?


ANTHONY .
Why , Barbara , God help us all , what 's this ?
You do n't mean to say that there was -


BARBARA .
Here it is , as true as true : they were going for a jaunt  and Miss Foster had her gout  and I was to go with them  and he told me to make-believe I was ill  and I did  and I stayed at home  and he gave me that necklace  and they went away together  and , oh dear !
I wish I 'd never been born .


ANTHONY .
Together ?
he and Dolly ?
Good Lord !
my sister !
And since then ?


BARBARA .
We have n't seen him from that day to this , the wicked villain  and , Mr. Anthony , he has n't so much as written the poor dear a word .


ANTHONY .
Bab , Bab , Bab , this is a devil of a bad business  this is a cruel bad business , Baby  cruel upon me , cruel upon all of us  a family like mine .
I 'm a young man , Barbara , to have this delicate affair to manage  but , thank God , I 'm Musgrave to the bone .
He bribed a servant-maid , did he ?
I keep his bribe  it 's mine now  dear bought , by George !
He shall have it in his teeth .
Shot Colonel Villiers , did he ?
we 'll see how he faces Anthony Musgrave .
You 're a good girl , Barbara  so far you 've served the family .
You leave this to me .
And , hark ye , dry your eyes and hold your tongue : I 'll have no scandal raised by you .


BARBARA .
I do hope , sir , you wo n't use me against Miss Dorothy .


ANTHONY .
That 's my affair  your business is to hold your tongue .
Miss Dorothy has made her bed and must lie on it .
Here 's Jack Fenwick .
You can go .
SCENE V


ANTHONY , FENWICK


ANTHONY .
Jack Fenwick , is that you ?
Come here , my boy .
Jack , you 've given me many a thrashing , and I deserved 'em  and I 'll not see you made a fool of now .
George Austin is a damned villain , and Dorothy Musgrave is no girl for you to marry : God help me that I should have to say it .


FENWICK .
Good God , who told YOU ?


ANTHONY .
Ay , Jack  it 's hard on me , Jack .
But you 'll stand my friend in spite of this , and you 'll take my message to the man , wo n't you ?
For it 's got to come to blood , Jack : there 's no way out of that .
And perhaps your poor friend will fall , Jack  think of that : like Villiers .
And all for an unworthy sister .


FENWICK .
Now , Anthony Musgrave , I give you fair warning  see you take it : one word more against your sister , and we quarrel .


ANTHONY .
You let it slip yourself , Jack : you know yourself she 's not a virtuous girl .


FENWICK .
What do you know of virtue , whose whole boast is to be vicious ?
How dare you draw conclusions ?
Dolt and puppy !
you can no more comprehend that angel 's excellencies than she can stoop to believe in your vices .
And you talk morality ?
Anthony , I 'm a man who has been somewhat roughly tried : take care .


ANTHONY .
You do n't seem able to grasp the situation , Jack .
It 's very remarkable  I 'm the girl 's natural protector  and you should buckle-to and help , like a friend of the family .
And instead of that , begad !
you turn on me like all the rest .


FENWICK .
Now mark me fairly : Mr. Austin follows at my heels  he comes to offer marriage to your sister - that is all you know , and all you shall know  and if by any misplaced insolence of yours this marriage should miscarry , you have to answer , not to Mr. Austin only , but to me .


ANTHONY .
It 's all a most discreditable business , and I do n't see how you propose to better it by cutting my throat .
Of course if he 's going to marry her , it 's a different thing  but I do n't believe he is , or he 'd have asked me .
You think me a fool ?
Well see they marry , or they 'll find me a dangerous fool .


SCENE VI


TO THESE , AUSTIN , BARBARA ANNOUNCING


BARBARA .
Mr. Austin .
( SHE SHOWS AUSTIN IN , AND RETIRES . )


AUSTIN .
You will do me the justice to acknowledge , Mr. Fenwick , that I have been not long delayed by my devotion to the Graces .


ANTHONY .
So , sir , I find you in my house -


AUSTIN .
And charmed to meet you again .
It went against my conscience to separate so soon .
Youth , Mr. Musgrave , is to us older men a perpetual refreshment .


ANTHONY .
You came here , sir , I suppose , upon some errand ?


AUSTIN .
My errand , Mr. Musgrave , is to your fair sister .
Beauty , as you know , comes before valour .
ANTHONY .
In my own house , and about my own sister , I presume I have the right to ask for something more explicit .


AUSTIN .
The right , my dear sir , is beyond question  but it is one , as you were going on to observe , on which no gentleman insists .


FENWICK .
Anthony , my good fellow , I think we had better go .


ANTHONY .
I have asked a question .


AUSTIN .
Which I was charmed to answer , but which , on repetition , might begin to grow distasteful .


ANTHONY .
In my own house -


FENWICK .
For God 's sake , Anthony !


AUSTIN .
In your aunt 's house , young gentleman , I shall be careful to refrain from criticism .
I am come upon a visit to a lady : that visit I shall pay  when you desire ( if it be possible that you desire it ) to resume this singular conversation , select some fitter place .
Mr. Fenwick , this afternoon , may I present you to his Royal Highness ?


ANTHONY .
Why , sir , I believe you must have misconceived me .
I have no wish to offend : at least at present .


AUSTIN .
Enough , sir .
I was persuaded I had heard amiss .
I trust we shall be friends .


FENWICK .
Come , Anthony , come : here is your sister .


( AS FENWICK AND ANTHONY GO OUT , C. , ENTER DOROTHY , L. )


SCENE VII


AUSTIN , DOROTHY


DOROTHY .
I am told , Mr. Austin , that you wish to see me .


AUSTIN .
Madam , can you doubt of that desire ?
can you question my sincerity ?


DOROTHY .
Sir , between you and me these compliments are worse than idle : they are unkind .
Sure , we are alone !


AUSTIN .
I find you in an hour of cruelty , I fear .
Yet you have condescended to receive this poor offender  and having done so much , you will not refuse to give him audience .


DOROTHY .
You shall have no cause , sir , to complain of me .
I listen .


AUSTIN .
My fair friend , I have sent myself - a poor ambassador - to plead for your forgiveness .
I have been too long absent  too long , I would fain hope , madam , for you  too long for my honour and my love .
I am no longer , madam , in my first youth  but I may say that I am not unknown .
My fortune , originally small , has not suffered from my husbandry .
I have excellent health , an excellent temper , and the purest ardour of affection for your person .
I found not on my merits , but on your indulgence .
Miss Musgrave , will you honour me with your hand in marriage ?


DOROTHY .
Mr. Austin , if I thought basely of marriage , I should perhaps accept your offer .
There was a time , indeed , when it would have made me proudest among women .
I was the more deceived , and have to thank you for a salutary lesson .
You chose to count me as a cipher in your rolls of conquest  for six months you left me to my fate  and you come here to-day - prompted , I doubt not , by an honourable impulse - to offer this tardy reparation .
No : it is too late .


AUSTIN .
Do you refuse ?


DOROTHY .
Yours is the blame : we are no longer equal .
You have robbed me of the right to marry any one but you  and do you think me , then , so poor in spirit as to accept a husband on compulsion ?


AUSTIN .
Dorothy , you loved me once .


DOROTHY .
Ay , you will never guess how much : you will never live to understand how ignominious a defeat that conquest was .
I loved and trusted you : I judged you by myself  think , then , of my humiliation , when , at the touch of trial , all your qualities proved false , and I beheld you the slave of the meanest vanity - selfish , untrue , base !
Think , sir , what a humbling of my pride to have been thus deceived : to have taken for my idol such a commonplace imposture as yourself  to have loved - yes , loved - such a shadow , such a mockery of man .
And now I am unworthy to be the wife of any gentleman  and you - look me in the face , George - are you worthy to be my husband ?


AUSTIN .
No , Dorothy , I am not .
I was a vain fool  I blundered away the most precious opportunity  and my regret will be lifelong .
Do me the justice to accept this full confession of my fault .
I am here to-day to own and to repair it .


DOROTHY .
Repair it ?
Sir you condescend too far .


AUSTIN .
I perceive with shame how grievously I had misjudged you .
But now , Dorothy , believe me , my eyes are opened .
I plead with you , not as my equal , but as one in all ways better than myself .
I admire you , not in that trivial sense in which we men are wont to speak of women , but as God 's work : as a wise mind , a noble soul , and a most generous heart , from whose society I have all to gain , all to learn .
Dorothy , in one word , I love you .


DOROTHY .
And what , sir , has wrought this transformation ?
You knew me of old , or thought you knew me ?
Is it in six months of selfish absence that your mind has changed ?
When did that change begin ?
A week ago ?
Sure , you would have written !
To-day ?
Sir , if this offer be anything more than fresh offence , I have a right to be enlightened .


AUSTIN .
Madam , I foresaw this question .
So be it : I respect , and I will not deceive you .
But give me , first of all , a moment for defence .
There are few men of my habits and position who would have done as I have done : sate at the feet of a young boy , accepted his lessons , gone upon his errand : fewer still , who would thus , at the crisis of a love , risk the whole fortune of the soul - love , gratitude , even respect .
Yet more than that !
For conceive how I respect you , if I , whose lifelong trade has been flattery , stand before you and make the plain confession of a truth that must not only lower me , but deeply wound yourself .


DOROTHY .
What means - ?


AUSTIN .
Young Fenwick , my rival for your heart , he it was that sent me .


DOROTHY .
He ?
O disgrace !
He sent you !
That was what he meant ?
Am I fallen so low ?
Am I your common talk among men ?
Did you dice for me ?
Did he kneel ?
O John , John , how could you !
And you , Mr. Austin , whither have you brought me down ?
shame heaping upon shame - to what end !
oh , to what end ?


AUSTIN .
Madam , you wound me : you look wilfully amiss .
Sure , any lady in the land might well be proud to be loved as you are loved , with such nobility as Mr. Fenwick 's , with such humility as mine .
I came , indeed , in pity , in good-nature , what you will .
( See , dearest lady , with what honesty I speak : if I win you , it shall be with the unblemished truth . )
All that is gone .
Pity ?
it is myself I pity .
I offer you not love - I am not worthy .
I ask , I beseech of you : suffer me to wait upon you like a servant , to serve you with my rank , my name , the whole devotion of my life .
I am a gentleman - ay , in spite of my fault - an upright gentleman  and I swear to you that you shall order your life and mine at your free will .
Dorothy , at your feet , in remorse , in respect , in love - O such love as I have never felt , such love as I derided - I implore , I conjure you to be mine !


DOROTHY .
Too late !
too late .


AUSTIN .
No , no , not too late : not too late for penitence , not too late for love .


DOROTHY .
Which do you propose ?
that I should abuse your compassion , or reward your treachery ?
George Austin , I have been your mistress , and I will never be your wife .


AUSTIN .
Child , dear child , I have not told you all : there is worse still : your brother knows  the boy as good as told me .
Dorothy , this is scandal at the door - O let that move you : for that , if not for my sake , for that , if not for love , trust me , trust me again .


DOROTHY .
I am so much the more your victim : that is all , and shall that change my heart ?
The sin must have its wages .
This , too , was done long ago : when you stooped to lie to me .
The shame is still mine , the fault still yours .


AUSTIN .
Child , child , you kill me : you will not understand .
Can you not see ?
the lad will force me to a duel .
DOROTHY .
And you will kill him ?
Shame after shame , threat upon threat .
Marry me , or you are dishonoured  marry me , or your brother dies : and this is man 's honour !
But my honour and my pride are different .
I will encounter all misfortune sooner than degrade myself by an unfaithful marriage .
How should I kneel before the altar , and vow to reverence as my husband you , you who deceived me as my lover ?


AUSTIN .
Dorothy , you misjudge me cruelly  I have deserved it .
You will not take me for your husband  why should I wonder ?
You are right .
I have indeed filled your life with calamity : the wages , ay , the wages , of my sin are heavy upon you .
But I have one more thing to ask of your pity  and O remember , child , who it is that asks it : a man guilty in your sight , void of excuse , but old , and very proud , and most unused to supplication .
Dorothy Musgrave , will you forgive George Austin ?


DOROTHY .
O , George !


AUSTIN .
It is the old name : that is all I ask , and more than I deserve .
I shall remember , often remember , how and where it was bestowed upon me for the last time .
I thank you , Dorothy , from my heart  a heart , child , that has been too long silent , but is not too old , I thank God !
not yet too old , to learn a lesson and to accept a reproof .
I will not keep you longer : I will go - I am so bankrupt in credit that I dare not ask you to believe in how much sorrow .
But , Dorothy , my acts will speak for me with more persuasion .
If it be in my power , you shall suffer no more through me : I will avoid your brother  I will leave this place , I will leave England , to-morrow  you shall be no longer tortured with the neighbourhood of your ungenerous lover .
Dorothy , farewell !


SCENE VIII


DOROTHY  TO WHOM , ANTHONY , L .


DOROTHY ( ON HER KNEES , AND REACHING WITH HER HANDS . )
George , George !
( ENTER ANTHONY . )
ANTHONY .
Ha !
what are you crying for ?


DOROTHY .
Nothing , dear !
( RISING . )


ANTHONY .
Is Austin going to marry you ?


DOROTHY .
I shall never marry .


ANTHONY .
I thought as much .
You should have come to me .


DOROTHY .
I know , dear , I know  but there was nothing to come about .


ANTHONY .
It 's a lie .
You have disgraced the family .
You went to John Fenwick : see what he has made of it !
But I will have you righted : it shall be atoned in the man 's blood .


DOROTHY .
Anthony !
And if I had refused him ?


ANTHONY .
You ?
refuse George Austin ?
You never had the chance .


DOROTHY .
I have refused him .


ANTHONY .
Dorothy , you lie .
You would shield your lover  but this concerns not you only : it strikes my honour and my father 's honour .


DOROTHY .
I have refused him - refused him , I tell you - refused him .
The blame is mine  are you so mad and wicked that you will not see ?


ANTHONY .
I see this : that man must die .


DOROTHY .
He ?
never !
You forget , you forget whom you defy  you run upon your death .


ANTHONY .
Ah , my girl , you should have thought of that before .
It is too late now .
DOROTHY .
Anthony , if I beg you - Anthony , I have tried to be a good sister  I brought you up , dear , nursed you when you were sick , fought for you , hoped for you , loved you - think of it , think of the dear past , think of our home and the happy winter nights , the castles in the fire , the long shining future , the love that was to forgive and suffer always - O you will spare , you will spare me this .


ANTHONY .
I will tell you what I will do , Dolly : I will do just what you taught me - my duty : that , and nothing else .


DOROTHY .
O Anthony , you also , you to strike me !
Heavens , shall I kill them - I - I , that love them , kill them !
Miserable , sinful girl !
George , George , thank God , you will be far away !
O go , George , go at once !


ANTHONY .
He goes the coward !
Ay , is this more of your contrivance ?
Madam , you make me blush .
But to-day at least I know where I can find him .
This afternoon , on the Pantiles , he must dance attendance on the Duke of York .
Already he must be there  and there he is at my mercy .
DOROTHY .
Thank God , you are deceived : he will not fight .
He promised me that  thank God I have his promise for that .


ANTHONY .
Promise !
Do you see this ?
( PRODUCING NECKLACE ) the thing he bribed your maid with ?
I shall dash it in his teeth before the Duke and before all Tunbridge .
Promise , you poor fool ?
what promise holds against a blow ?
Get to your knees and pray for him  for , by the God above , if he has any blood in his body , one of us shall die before to-night .
( HE GOES OUT . )


DOROTHY .
Anthony , Anthony !
... O my God , George will kill him .

SCENE I


MISS FOSTER , BARBARA , MENTEITH  VISITORS


MISS FOSTER ( ENTERING  ESCORTED BY MENTEITH , AND FOLLOWED BY BARBARA ) .
And so , Menteith , here you are once more .
And vastly pleased I am to see you , my good fellow , not only for your own sake , but because you harbinger the Beau .
( SITS , L.  MENTEITH STANDING OVER HER . )


MENTEITH .
Honoured madam , I have had the pleasure to serve Mr. George for more than thirty years .
This is a privilege - a very great privilege .
I have beheld him in the first societies , moving among the first rank of personages  and none , madam , none outshone him .


BARBARA .
I assure you , madam , when Mr. Menteith took me to the play , he talked so much of Mr. Austin that I could n't hear a word of Mr. Kean .


MISS FOSTER .
Well , well , and very right .
That was the old school of service , Barbara , which you would do well to imitate .
This is a child , Menteith , that I am trying to form .


MENTEITH .
Quite so , madam .


MISS FOSTER .
And are we soon to see our princely guest , Menteith ?
MENTEITH .
His Royal Highness , madam ?
I believe I may say quite so .
Mr. George will receive our gallant prince upon the Pantiles


( LOOKING AT HIS WATCH ) in , I should say , a matter of twelve minutes from now .
Such , madam , is Mr. George 's order of the day .


BARBARA .
I beg your pardon , madam , I am sure , but are we really to see one of His Majesty 's own brothers ?
That will be pure !
O madam , this is better than Carlisle .


MISS FOSTER .
The wood-note wild : a loyal Cumbrian , Menteith .


MENTEITH .
Eh ?
Quite so , madam .


MISS FOSTER .
When she has seen as much of the Royal Family as you , my good fellow , she will find it vastly less entertaining .


MENTEITH .
Yes , madam , indeed  In these distinguished circles , life is but a slavery .
None of the best set would relish Tunbridge without Mr. George  Tunbridge and Mr. George ( if you 'll excuse my plainness , madam ) are in a manner of speaking identified  and indeed it was the Dook 's desire alone that brought us here .


BARBARA .
What ?
the Duke ?
O dear !
was it for that ?


MENTEITH .
Though , to be sure , madam , Mr. George would always be charmed to find himself ( BOWING ) among so many admired members of his own set .


MISS FOSTER .
Upon my word , Menteith , Mr. Austin is as fortunate in his servant as his reputation .


MENTEITH .
Quite so , madam .
But let me observe that the opportunities I have had of acquiring a knowledge of Mr. George 's character have been positively unrivalled .
Nobody knows Mr. George like his old attendant .
The goodness of that gentleman - but , madam , you will soon be equally fortunate , if , as I understand , it is to be a match .


MISS FOSTER .
I hope , Menteith , you are not taking leave of your senses .
Is it possible you mean my niece ?


MENTEITH .
Madam , I have the honour to congratulate you .
I put a second curl in Mr. George 's hair on purpose .


SCENE II


TO THESE , AUSTIN .
MENTEITH FALLS BACK , AND AUSTIN TAKES HIS PLACE IN FRONT OF MISS FOSTER , HIS ATTITUDE A COUNTERPART OF MENTEITH 'S .


AUSTIN .
Madam , I hasten to present my homage .


MISS FOSTER .
A truce to compliments !
Menteith , your charming fellow there , has set me positively crazy .
Dear George Austin , is it true ?
can it be true ?


AUSTIN .
Madam , if he has been praising your niece he has been well inspired .
If he was speaking , as I spoke an hour ago myself , I wish , Miss Foster , that he had held his tongue .
I have indeed offered myself to Miss Dorothy , and she , with the most excellent reason , has refused me .


MISS FOSTER .
Is it possible ?
why , my dear George Austin ... then I suppose it is John Fenwick after all !


AUSTIN .
Not one of us is worthy .


MISS FOSTER .
This is the most amazing circumstance .
You take my breath away .
My niece refuse George Austin ?
why , I give you my word , I thought she had adored you .
A perfect scandal : it positively must not get abroad .


AUSTIN .
Madam , for that young lady I have a singular regard .
Judge me as tenderly as you can , and set it down , if you must , to an old man 's vanity - for , Evelina , we are no longer in the heyday of our youth - judge me as you will : I should prefer to have it known .


MISS FOSTER .
Can you ?
George Austin , you ?
My youth was nothing  I was a failure  but for you ?
no , George , you never can , you never must be old .
You are the triumph of my generation , George , and of our old friendship too .
Think of my first dance and my first partner .
And to have this story - no , I could not bear to have it told of you .


AUSTIN .
Madam , there are some ladies over whom it is a boast to have prevailed  there are others whom it is a glory to have loved .
And I am so vain , dear Evelina , that even thus I am proud to link my name with that of Dorothy Musgrave .


MISS FOSTER .
George , you are changed .
I would not know you .


AUSTIN .
I scarce know myself .
But pardon me , dear friend ( TAKING HIS WATCH ) , in less than four minutes our illustrious guest will descend amongst us  and I observe Mr. Fenwick , with whom I have a pressing business .
Suffer me , dear Evelina !
-


SCENE III


To these , FENWICK .
MISS FOSTER remains seated , L. AUSTIN goes R. to FENWICK , whom he salutes with great respect AUSTIN .
Mr. Fenwick , I have played and lost .
That noble lady , justly incensed at my misconduct , has condemned me .
Under the burden of such a loss , may I console myself with the esteem of Mr. Fenwick ?


FENWICK .
She refused you ?
Pardon me , sir , but was the fault not yours ?


AUSTIN .
Perhaps to my shame , I am no novice , Mr. Fenwick  but I have never felt nor striven as to-day .
I went upon your errand  but , you may trust me , sir , before I had done I found it was my own .
Until to-day I never rightly valued her  sure , she is fit to be a queen .
I have a remorse here at my heart to which I am a stranger .
Oh !
that was a brave life , that was a great heart that I have ruined .


FENWICK .
Ay , sir , indeed .


AUSTIN .
But , sir , it is not to lament the irretrievable that I intrude myself upon your leisure .
There is something to be done , to save , at least to spare , that lady .
You did not fail to observe the brother ?


FENWICK .
No , sir , he knows all  and being both intemperate and ignorant -


AUSTIN .
Surely .
I know .
I have to ask you then to find what friends you can among this company  and if you have none , to make them .
Let everybody hear the news .
Tell it ( if I may offer the suggestion ) with humour : how Mr. Austin , somewhat upon the wane , but still filled with sufficiency , gloriously presumed and was most ingloriously set down by a young lady from the north : the lady 's name a secret , which you will permit to be divined .
The laugh - the position of the hero - will make it circulate  - you perceive I am in earnest  - and in this way I believe our young friend will find himself forestalled .


FENWICK .
Mr. Austin , I would not have dared to ask so much of you  I will go further : were the positions changed , I should fear to follow your example .


AUSTIN .
Child , child , you could not afford it .


SCENE IV


To there , the ROYAL DUKE , C.  then , immediately , ANTHONY , L. FENWICK crosses to MISS FOSTER , R. AUSTIN accosts the DUKE , C. , in dumb show  the muted strings take up a new air , Mozart 's ` Anglaise '  couples passing under the limes , and forming a group behind AUSTIN and the DUKE .
ANTHONY in front , L. , watches AUSTIN , who , as he turns from the DUKE , sees him , and comes forward with extended hand .


AUSTIN .
Dear child , let me present you to his Royal Highness .


ANTHONY ( WITH NECKLACE ) .
Mr. Austin , do you recognise the bribe you gave my sister 's maid ?


AUSTIN .
Hush , sir , hush !
you forget the presence of the Duke .


ANTHONY .
Mr. Austin , you are a coward and a scoundrel .


AUSTIN .
My child , you will regret these words : I refuse your quarrel .


ANTHONY .
You do ?
Take that .
( HE STRIKES AUSTIN ON THE MOUTH .
AT THE MOMENT OF THE BLOW - ) SCENE V


TO THESE , DOROTHY , L. U. E. DOROTHY , UNSEEN BY AUSTIN , SHRIEKS .
SENSATION .
MUSIC STOPS .
TABLEAU


AUSTIN ( RECOVERING HIS COMPOSURE ) .
Your Royal Highness , suffer me to excuse the disrespect of this young gentleman .
He has so much apology , and I have , I hope , so good a credit , as incline me to accept this blow .
But I must beg of your Highness , and , gentlemen , all of you here present , to bear with me while I will explain what is too capable of misconstruction .
I am the rejected suitor of this young gentleman 's sister  of Miss Dorothy Musgrave : a lady whom I singularly honour and esteem  a word from whom ( if I could hope that word ) would fill my life with happiness .
I was not worthy of that lady  when I was defeated in fair field , I presumed to make advances through her maid .
See in how laughable a manner fate repaid me !
The waiting-girl derided , the mistress denied , and now comes in this very ardent champion who publicly insults me .
My vanity is cured  you will judge it right , I am persuaded , all of you , that I should accept my proper punishment in silence  you , my Lord Duke , to pardon this young gentleman  and you , Mr. Musgrave , to spare me further provocation , which I am determined to ignore .


DOROTHY ( RUSHING FORWARD , FALLING AT AUSTIN 'S KNEES , AND SEIZING HIS HAND ) .
George , George , it was for me .
My hero !
take me !
What you will !
AUSTIN ( IN AN AGONY ) .
My dear creature , remember that we are in public .
( RAISING HER . )
Your Royal Highness , may I present you Mrs. George Frederick Austin ?
