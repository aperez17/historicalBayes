The Mysterious Marriage


Act I


Scene 1


[ The outer wall and gate-way of a magnificent Castle , with an ascent , and distant view of the entrance .
Osmond and Uberto meeting . ]


Osmond .
YOU come from the chace , Uberto : what 's the sport ?


Uberto .
Sport !
marry , such sport as had well nigh cost us our lives , and our friends some score of masses .


Osmond .
You roused then the boar !


Uberto .
I warrant you we did , and to some purpose too !
An I e'er rouse another such , I 'll give him leave to make a dinner of me .
But for our brave guest , the Lord Sigismond , I question whether our souls had not come to tell you whereabouts they had left our bodies .
- In my life shall I never forget how he churned and tore up the ground with rage !
And what 's most strange , methought , when his eyes glared with the greatest fury , he always looked full upon me .
Yet I had not offended him either  for if some people 's valour did not lie nearer the point of their lance than mine , the boar might have made his breakfast i ` the forest , and we ours i ` the castle , without either of us taking a fancy to a limb of the other .


Osmond .
But , Sigismond !


Uberto .
True !
he 's a hero - and your hero , I suppose , has a life or two more to spare than your commoner .
Br [ ief ] ly , however , he advanced , brandished his spear with a determined look - as - thus !
- and - I will not wrong my honesty so far as to say I saw him kill the monster - But this I will certify - I saw the monster dead , and heard our whole troop shout to the honour of Sigismond .


Osmond .
'T is a brave youth !


Uberto .
And courteous too  I warrant he 's nobly born !


Osmond .
At least he 's nobly bred .


Uberto .
And methinks love could not devise a better match of gentleness , than betwixt him and my lord 's young favourite , the Lady Constantia .


Osmond .
Trust me , no !
Uberto , there 's a secret spring of blood That bids the obscure still soar !
'T is Nature 's touch  Who thus would mock the avarice of Fortune , Wooing her from her own !
He 'll no Constantia !
Nay much I err too , or our beauteous Countess Beholds the young and gallant Sigismond With more than friendly gaze .
Come , come , thou ` st marked it .


Uberto .
Why truly I have seen some glances pass between them , that it were worth more than my head to recount to my lord .
For , despite of what nature may do in the heart of his daughter , she will never , I trow , move his into thinking , that all these noble titles and princely domains should fall into the hands of a vagrant stranger - and a prisoner too .


Osmond .
He had ne'er been a prisoner but in the cause of the Count .
Thou knowest that on the day my lord and his daughter were ta'en captive by a band of wandering Poles - this young stranger - this valiant Sigismond , stood forth to save her from dishonour , and drew his sabre even against his countrymen .


Uberto .
Yes  and his countrymen rewarded him for it by leaving him in our hands !
- What a tale dost thou tell me , as if I was not in at the rescue  and did not with my good sword -


Osmond .
Nay , good Uberto - keep but they tongue as quiet as they sword , and - [ music ] - Peace !
the hunters !
- 't is the horn of Sigismond .


Uberto .
And , true to the sound , see if my lady , the Countess , be not roused up to give him welcome .
Well , how easily may a man perceive a thing when he 's told it !
methinks I can spy out love in the very folds of her robe - and then there 's a turn in her eye - [ Music , and chorus of Hunters . ]
`` Hail to the sprightly beams of morn !
`` Gaily sound the mellow horn !
`` Call on echo to reply , - [ Echo ]


`` Hark , she answers to the cry !
[ Echo repeated at intervals . ]
`` Sound , sound again the mellow horn !
`` Echo hails the sprightly morn ! ''


[ The hunters pass in groups across the stage  and enter the castle-walls with Osmond - the Countess descending at the same time , they salute her severally - Sigismond enters last . ]


Sigismond [ seeing the Countess ] .
Uberto , bear my greetings to thy lord  I wait him on the instant .
My fair hostess !
Oh how the morning brightens with the beam That radiates from those eyes !
A smile like that Breaks from the heav ` ns , when day-spring gilds the east , And nature lives before it !
Thou should ` st chide Th ` uncourtly hand , that , reckless of the heart , Lays not beneath thy feet our sylvan triumphs - The boar 's rough spoils .


Countess .
Believe me , Sigismond , I should have deem'd the uncouth gift misplaced : And honour more the instinctive human polish That bade thee spare it , than the laboured courtesy That with a bloody spoil would grace a woman .
Nay trust me , Sir , - but 't is my father 's part To chide his guest - You have been much in danger .
E'en now I heard the tale with mingled fear - Yet 't was not fear - 't was but a passing wonder !
How , rough of taste , your souls should hunt out death , And brave him e ` en in scenes , which our weak sex Shrink from the view of !


Sigismond .
Prettiness of nature !
- Who , sportive goddess , has embodied weakness In the fair form of woman , to create Instinctive force and energy in man !
To guard such fragile loveliness as thine , We cherish danger , my fair monistress !
And grow familiar with the forms of death .
But why of death or danger do we talk ?
Hence with th ` ill-omen'd words !
Thy lip 's rich ruby Grows pale beneath them !
While a half-drawn breath , That quivered to a sigh , disturb'd its polish , As summer breezes ripple the smooth stream .


Countess .
I did not sigh !
Or if perchance I did , Is it for you to weigh - You are too forward !
` Twere well to scant this aptness of remark , And tread in narrower scope .


Sigismond [ going ] .
You teach me right .
I shall remember , Madam .


Countess .
Gone so soon !
Oh , these hot spirits !
What , my father waits !
Or say , the honours of our rural feast Demand your presence !
Well , Sir !
We can spare you .
One word alone !
Deem not , that conscious rank , Nor all the selfish pride that waits on greatness , Impels me thus - I lose myself again - Begone !
-


Sigismond .
Impossible !
The witchery of that voice Spreads in soft circles thro ' the ambient air , And roots me spell-bound !
Witness for me heaven , If there be cause of pride in human kind , I deem it most in thee !
- Nor aught that greatness , Wealth , or superior power can give , e'er added To they attractions , or can dim their lustre !
I see thee noblest in thy noble soul  Richest in beauty  while my willing heart Bows down to both , and owns its conqueror .


Countess .
All-gracious heaven !


Sigismond .
To tell thee that I love , Is but to give the feeble form of words To my soul 's language !
Yet I am not rash , Save only in adoring .
Proud alone In that I deem no other of thy sex Worthy my thought .
Nor do I to the heiress Of these rich lands aspire - The woman only , Shrin'd in my heart , has all its vows  its wishes In the rude current of my fate are wrecked .
Once , and once only .
[ kisses her hand ] Oh !
that this deep sigh , Whose forceful energy doth shake my being , Could breathe a sacred atmosphere around !
Guard thee from sorrow , sickness , or disquiet !
And , fraught with every bliss it wafts from me , Enrich thy fate with our united store !
I trespass .
-


Countess .
Oh !
Too noble Sigismond !
There is a native candour at my heart , That struggles with my sex 's wonted forms To tell thee - But it should not be !
Farewell !
- Yet - If the woman claim indeed thy thought , Oh !
deem she has one virtue worthy thee  The sense of thine .


Sigismond [ kneeling ] .
Heav ` ns !
Did I hear aright !


Countess .
Perchance thou didst not !
We may be observ'd .
Rise , gentle Sigismond - Another time - Nay , pr ` ythee rise !
For see , where loved Constantia Comes , drooping like a blossom of the spring , That wintry gales have shook .
Retire , I charge thee - We will speak more anon .


[ Exit Sigismond towards the Castle .
- Constantia enters , leaning on Theresa . ]


Countess .
How fares my friend ?


Constantia [ faintly ] .
Why , if to die be good , I should say well .
Nature , that smiles around , yet smiles not here  [ laying her hand on her breast ] And life but feebly flutters o'er my heart , Ev'n as the wounded bird upon her nest .


Countess .
Oh !
thou art vapourish !
Trust me , I shall chide .
Is it for years like thine to talk of death ?
Come , we shall mark the roses steal again Upon thy cheek : Nay , pr ` ythee look , Theresa , Dost thou not see the wily traitors ambush'd Ev'n mid the lilies that usurp their throne ?
Your hand  Come , chearly !
This is the mere form , The ceremony of sickness .
Let me lead you To yonder sunny border - The fresh dew Claims cautious treading here .
[ Exit Theresa . ]
Now could I tell a tale - Oh !
have I caught you ?
Well , when a woman 's heart informs her head , How soon she may defy the schools !
'T is a nice art , that from such premises Can draw conclusions : I but looked a secret , And you have guessed it .


Constantia .
Is Alberto come ?


Countess .
Nay , pr ` ythee patience !
The first lord o ' the court , Without a train or courier ?
Cry you mercy !
The turtles of Arcadia had their wings , And flew at will  our modern ones are clipt , Confin'd , and tutor'd - Therefore 't is , their notes Are oft unmusical .
Yet is he coming , Fast as a courtier 's zeal , and great man 's train , Can convoy him !


Constantia .
Oh , wherefore comes he now ?
Now , when my faded form -


Countess .
True woman still !
Come now , regret the toilette !
Swear Alberto Better at court than here  and those fair tresses , That kiss the wanton Zephyrs as they blow , And woo them to thy bosom , thus dishevell'd , Mere Medusean locks !


Constantia .
Oh , not for that , Nor for the few faint graces of a storm Now crush'd to earth , do I lament !
- Alberto , If e'er he lov'd me , lov'd me not for those .
Witness , ye conscious shades !
where my sick heart Still courts the spirit of departed hours , 'T was sympathy of thought , congenial taste , 'T was the fair lucid web that fancy weaves O'er yielding souls , and sensibility Enriches with her thousand Iris hues , That bound us to each other .
- He is changed !
Changed to himself !
The world has stepp'd between us  Blasted with magic spell our fairy bow ` rs , Nor left ev'n Love the power to make us happy .


Countess .
Oh , we shall try its influence !
True , Alberto , No more the stripling that some two years past Thought love supreme , now tow ` rs above his equals  Far-fam'd for valour , as for noble birth  And boasts a monarch 's favour .
- Say , 't was fortune , A lucky chance , that bade the Turkish squadrons Fly from his sword , and our best chieftains own him Bravest amid the brave !
He deems not so : - But , conscious of superior power , infers Superior merit .
Yet when court cabals , Levees , and flatterers , cease to fill the day , When our sweet shades again shall woo to love , And peace - But soft !
- my father !
- Dear Constantia , Resume thy fortitude !
I shall have much , Much yet to tell thee .


Count Roselva [ entering ] .
Oh , you 're found , my wanderers !
I sought you through the castle : sweet Constantia , Wilt thou still play the sick one ?
Shame upo n't !
We must call in a tribe of our young courtiers To bid the truant blushes to their station .
We shall have feasts anon !
What says my daughter ?
I bring you tidings of the Lord Alberto - He comes upon the hour .


Countess .
Indeed !


Count Roselva .
Even so !
Nay , I might tell you more , but troth you care not .
You are too much enamoured of each other To think of revelry and sports  tho ' ev'n A brave young lord should head them .
Nay , should the king , Devising how he may enrich a favourite , Send him to claim a bride .


Countess .
A bride !


Constantia .
Oh heaven !


Countess .
How is ` t , Constantia ?


Constantia .
But a sudden sickness - Your pardon , Sir !
You spoke of Lord Alberto  Or was 't the error of mine ear ?


Count Roselva .
Constantia , These sudden starts , and panic fits of tremor , Claim heedful notice  they import a malady Of dangerous consequence  and our true love Bids seek a remedy .
` Twere best retire : The air blows chill for tender frames like thine , [ The Countess leads Constantia towards the Castle . ]
And tender hearts too !
This fond girl disturbs me !
There is a secret in this cherished weakness I do not wish to learn .
[ To the Countess , who returns . ]
Thou ` rt made of tears And soft endearments !
'T is your sex 's foible Ever to love too little , or too much !
Of thy fair friend no more .
Dear tho ' I prize her , There is a closer , softer , nearer tie , That twines around my heart .
My darling child !
With what excess of fondness I have loved thee , Heav'n only knows !
And well thy youthful grace , Thy gentle manners , and unsullied duty , Have justified the weakness .
Can I then , Even in the bloom and lustre of thy virtues , Then , when my feeble age most claims their succour , Can I consent to lose thee ?
Yet , my daughter , Spite of these foolish drops that mar my speech , It must be so !
Thou art Lord Albert 's bride .
The court , the world , demand thee !
Royalty Itself most graciously approves the union .
Fraught with remembrance of thy early charms , Even now the favourite comes in haste to claim thee : Mark the dispatches !


Countess [ rejecting them ] .
Of my early charms !
Trust me , my Lord , Alberto mocks us both .


Count Roselva .
I would not have it so , nor will believe it .
There is a lurking spirit in thine eye That leads to disobedience  mark me well !
Motives most potent and unanswerable , That touch my honour , nay perhaps my life , Enforce thy prompt obedience !
Childish friendship , And all the flimsy web of fine-spun feelings , Are blown aside by the strong breath of nature .
For thy Constantia , when thou deck ` st a court , She will not want a husband .
Such a dowry , As a fond sire might give a second-born , My love shall lavish on her .


Countess .
Vainly lavish !
A grave and winding sheet , my lov'd Constantia , Will soon be all thy portion .


Count Roselva .
Pr ` ythee , peace !
Who dies in youth , dies best  dies innocent : Yet thou may ` st live so too !


Countess .
Alas , my father !
You tremble , you are pale - some cruel secret - Of honour and of life you spoke but late !
I marked it not  but now thick-rushing fancies Press on my heart , and call forth all its fears .


Count Roselva .
Why should ` st thou know , what knowing would afflict thee ?
Art thou not noble , rich , and innocent ?


Countess .
I hope I am so !


Count Roselva .
Then be sure o n't quickly , By being Albert 's wife !


Countess .
Oh , tell me wherefore ?
What mystery 's in this ?
Why should I barter A name as great , a state more rich than Albert 's , For aught that he can offer ?
And for virtue , Judge me just heav ` n , how scant would be its portion In the base heart that thus could wrong itself !


Count Roselva .
Then wrong thy father !
Disavow thy name !
Bring my hoar head with sorrow to the grave , And wander forth a hopeless , helpless orphan .


Countess .
What should this mean ?
Heav'n shield my honour'd sire !
Some phrenzy , sure -


Count Roselva .
The worst of phrenzy - Guilt !
- Yet 't was a venial crime !
Hear me , my daughter !
I will a tale unfold - Which on thy life , thy honour , and thy duty , I do command thee never to reveal !
- A younger brother born , and unendowed , My youth was past in penury and arms .
I lov'd thy mother  truly , fondly loved  Yet lived to lose her !
Thee , her helpless offspring , Unheeded by a proud and wealthy race , I rear'd in sorrow !
Till the chance of war , On one drear night , led forth a band of Turks , To waste the lands thou seest , and spoil yon castle , The scene was bloody  for my wealthier brother , Heedless of danger , and unskill'd in arms , Lodged there his wife and infants : they were twins : Twins , as it seemed , in sorrow !
To be brief , Th ' exterminating foe swept off our vassals , And in the carnage spared nor youth nor age .
I came to claim my rights  and found yon towers , That lift their heads so gaily o'er the landscape , A scene of desolation !
One domestic ` Scaped from the massacre  and , while he hail'd me , Breathed an unwelcome secret in mine ear - The children -


Countess .
What of them ?


Count Roselva .
Both were not dead !
Hid with her nurse in the surrounding forest , The girl survived .


Countess .
My heart divines the rest !
It was Constantia !


Count Roselva .
Pr ` ythee , calm thy transports !
I saw this infant - born to princely fortunes , Torn from great Nature 's mass , and left to me  Me , doomed henceforth her vassal , or her lord !
I chose my fate !
The rest I need not tell .
Thou know ` st with what officious care my heart Has reared her childhood  with what tender fondness , Next to thyself , has drawn her to my bosom .
Nor have I , like the iron-hearted villain , Hated whom I had injured .
Yet does fear , The curse of guilt , hang upon my footsteps .
Her age - her form - and some surviving vassals , Whom neither power can trace , nor wealth can silence , May yet betray me .


Countess .
Oh !
betray thyself !
Call to thy memory the glorious precept That bids us guard the helpless and the orphan , And boldly -


Count Roselva .
Rash , misjudging girl , beware !
Silence thy murmurs  summon all thy duty  As Albert 's wife , no voice shall dare arraign thee .
No hand of pow ' r shall seize these fair domains , Or blast me with dishonour .
[ bugle sounds without ] Hark !
the summons That bids me greet my noble guest .
Beware !
For know , the hour that tells thy father 's shame , Fixes thy father 's fate !
[ Lays his hand on his sword , and exit . ]


Countess [ sola ] .
Thou Pow ' r supreme !
Gild the wild mazes of this perilous way With thy bright star of truth !
And oh !
whatever ills my fate betide , Still let its sacred beams my footsteps guide !
Dark tho ' the clouds , and black the tempest roll , The ray is ne'er obscured that lights the soul .


[ Music , with an accompaniment of cymbals , c. by Turkish slaves , who advance with the domestics of the Count , and take their station before the gate  they are met by the retinue of Albert : who , lastly , appears himself , and with the procession , enters the Castle . ]


END OF ACT I


Act II


Scene 1


[ An antichamber in the Castle , with folding doors , the pillars gaily wreathed with flowers , and the niches adorned with statues , bearing baskets of flowers on their heads .
- Music within . ]


Osmond [ entering hastily ] .
WHAT , ho !
who waits there ?
- Quick !
More wine i ` the feasting chamber !
Lazy knaves !
Is this a time to stare , and shake your heels ?
First let your lords be served !
More wine , I say !
Let the saloon be hung with fresher flowers : And see the ices yield not .
Quick !
- dispatch !
[ Exit .


[ Several servants cross the stage , bearing silver ewers of wine.Uberto and Mathias . ]


Uberto .
Pr ` ythee , good Mathias , let 's have a cup of my Lord 's Tokay , though it be but to drink to my Lady 's health .


Mathias [ drinking ] .
This is rare sport , i ` faith  if there be such merry days as this at court , why the devil take labour and the country , say I !


Uberto .
But who , I marvel , would have thought your courtiers had been such generous fellows , Mathias ?


Mathias .
Nay , for the matter of that , if it be generous to eat , drink , and be merry at another man 's cost , why generosity is a cheap virtue , and what few would be without .


Uberto .
There thou misconceivest me , man !
In the article of eating and drinking , I say not that your courtier is more kind-hearted than your clown  But if mirth be , as we are told , the zest of the entertainment , he must be allowed to be the most generous man alive who keeps the feast only for himself , and leaves the mirth for us , his poor servitors .
Now for the instance !
What think ` st thou of the company within ?


Mathias .
That my Lord is moody - the Countess hath the spleen - Sigismond is sad - and the Lady Constantia sick .
For the Lord Albert , indeed -


Uberto .
Oh !
he hath all complaints at once !
He hath the court fever  and looks at a serving-man , as though he wondered why heaven bestowed five senses on any being less magnificent than himself .


Mathias .
Come , another cup of wine , and then -


Uberto .
Peace , fool - We 'll have more wine anon  - for see , here comes the Lord Sigismond .


[ Sigismond enters from the folding doors , and passes the stage thoughtfully , speaking to Uberto .
- Music . ]


Servant [ followed by Rodolphus ] .
Dispatches from the court , to Lord Alberto .


[ Osmond gives them to Uberto , who carries them in .
Manent Osmond and Rodolphus . ]


Osmond .
Honest Rodolphus , welcome !
Thy suit bears testimony against thee  and looks as if thou hadst seen more service than preferment at court .


Rodolphus .
When I first wore this suit I was my Lord 's friend  now , I am but his serving-man .
I could have had a laced coat as well as the rest , had it so pleased me  but I had rather be the humble attendant of his fools , that the first fool of his attendants .


Osmond .
Why what is it that hath made thee so splenetic , good Rodolphus ?


Rodolphus .
That , master Osmond , which might make any man splenetic - age and disappointment .
I was my Lord 's follower when he was an infant  - his play-fellow when he was a boy  - and now that I am grown old and grey-headed , every knave that has the wit to flatter him , steps before me .


Osmond .
Yet I remember when you were here some two years ago -


Rodolphus .
Aye , good Osmond , thou art not grown a great man , and therefore may ` st reasonably have a memory of two years ' standing  - yet that of a great man , I trow , is not so short , but if a service is in question , he knows where to apply .
My Lord 's pride left me home  but his convenience did not forget that I should be the most faithful bearer of his dispatches .
[ The folding doors are opened ] But soft you - here he comes .
He seems moved too !
Why , what a fool am I to carry so green a heart under grey locks !
Now could I blubber like a whipt school boy , lest I should have been the bearer of mischief .


Albert [ with letters in his hand ] .
What time , Rodolphus , lost you on the road ?


Rodolphus .
Just two days , my Lord , four hours , and some odd minutes - the latter of which only were spent in eating and repose .


Albert [ thoughtfully ] .
Bear you from Arnulph aught ?


Rodolphus .
Nothing , my Lord .


Albert .
Two days ' delay !
Was there no quicker convoy ?


Rodolphus .
None , my Lord , unless I had interest in the air , and could have borrowed a pair of wings .
As far as gold or zeal could supply their place , your Lordship has no reason to complain .


Albert .
'T is well !
You may retire .
[ Exit Rodolphus . ]
- My adverse star At length hath gained th ` ascendant !
I am lost .
Down busy devil !
[ laying his hand on his heart ] Thou betray ` st thyself With fearful flushings  which , like lurid clouds , Portend to vulgar eyes the bursting storm .
A fallen favourite !
No time left to prop My tottering fortunes with Roselva 's pow ` r !
Ev'n when some ready demon was at hand To drive him to my purpose .
Yet , perhaps , All may be well yet .
Once espoused , the rank , The wealth , and numerous minions of my will , Conjointly with my personal daring , well Might awe ev'n royalty .
` Twere a brave deed To crush where I have vainly strove to snare  And with one strong , collected blow , destroy The puny insects that would sting me thus .
It fires my hope !
Who waits there ?
Say to the Count , I do desire a moment 's conf ` rence .
- Way , Sir !
[ to Sigismond , whom he meets . ]


Sigismond .
When Albert learns to speak with courtesy , He may have courteous hearing .


Albert .
Albert , Sir , Perhaps may want the time to scan his talk , And deal out candied courtesies of words By the quaint estimate of rustic breeding .


Sigismond .
Civility , my Lord , 's the courtier 's traffic !
I did not trespass on you for a virtue !


Albert .
You are presuming !


Sigismond .
Only frank , Lord Albert !
A very mirror to the passing object  Reflecting even its blots .


Albert .
Most free of speech !
This roof is privileged , or it might chance - You 're safe , Sir !


Sigismond .
So I shall esteem myself , While I do wear a sword !
[ Exit .
The Count enters on the other side . ]


Albert .
Noble Roselva , I press upon your leisure  but the time Is full of wayward checks .
The bubble , pleasure , Of late so sparkling to mine eye , hath burst , And leaves my stream of fortune dark and turbid .
I must to court , my Lord .


Count Roselva .
How , back so soon !


Albert .
With my best speed .
Some day or two , perchance , We steal from loyalty : days which , when passed , Like the bright lustre of a setting sun , Shall leave a golden track .
Oh !
it doth move me , Ev'n to my stretch of patience , that , or War , Or the blind demon , Politics , should haunt us Ev'n in the lap of Peace .


Count Roselva .
'T is most perverse !
The cause unknown too !


Albert .
Only hinted at , And sealed to secrecy .
- Oh !
dared I hope - But that were past presumption !


Count Roselva .
Noble Albert Can not presume !


Albert .
Alas !
you know me not !
I do confess me proud - aspiring - rash - Nursed in the lap of vain prosperity , And dazzled by my fortunes !
Thou , perhaps , Wilt deem so too , if I should thus , unwooing , Stinted the lover 's offerings of signs , Aspire to call Roselva 's heiress mine .


Count Roselva .
How !
Wed so suddenly !


Albert .
'T was a rash thought !
Your pardon , Sir .


Count Roselva [ thoughtfully ] .
My daughter hath a soul Noble as duteous  and so maiden white It hath not learnt to blush !
She may be won Beyond th ` observance of her sex 's rules .
And you have form and eloquence , my Lord , To tempt a woman 's will .
- I will consider .


Albert .
Nay , if considered - 't is half sanctified !
Come - come - it must be so !
Forms and ceremonies Are nought in honour 's or in love 's account .
Say , ` twere to-morrow -


Count Roselva .
Well !
- 't is sudden too - It may perchance be happier !
- Be it so !


Albert [ kissing his hand ] .
Now , by my life , this generous , frank compliance , Binds me your son and servant !


Count Roselva .
I will leave you : The time claims thought .
A father too hath pangs , When yielding thus the treasure of his age !
I will prepare my daughter .
Gentle Albert - When she is thine - But wherefore should I urge thee ?
Thou hast a soul to feel her worth .
- I 'm choak'd !
[ Exit abruptly . ]


Albert [ solus ] .
Prosperous so far !
Or hath my worser genius Betrayed me to my fate ?
A cold sick damp Ev'n dash'd me at the moment of success , And ` dew'd my dastard brow !
Constantia too !
Oh !
she came o'er me like a wintery cloud , Blasting my noon of fortunes .
She yet lives !
Th ' envenomed drugs have quench'd the flame of life , Yet left the embers .
- But a single chill , And those are cold too .
- Well !
it shall be weigh'd .
The demon , Pride , is busy in my soul , Holding a thousand hideous mirrors up , Peopled with shadowy mischiefs .
One fair form Alone stands forth , and points a bright perspective .
It must be so !
Roselva 's princely heiress Shall yet be mine !
Hence then the idle fopperies of love !
Who bars my fortune , must my vengeance prove !
[ Exit . ]


[ SCENE - A low Gothic gallery , with a range of arched doors on one side the stage , and painted casements on the other , to correspond . ]


Constantia [ sola ] .
He bade me meet him in the western gallery : Would he were here , or e'er my failing step Play truant to my heart .
Fain would I greet him As in the bloom and may-day of my life !
When my light foot scarce press'd th ` unconscious ground , And health diffused a lustre o'er the day That mock'd the paler sun-beam .
I have mark'd him  Noted each little change that time hath made In my heart 's tablet  and , with jealous glance , Have almost chid the rude and manlier graces That have usurp'd the primy charm of youth .
Hark !
- No !
- the sounding arches mock mine ear .
Ah , 't is himself !
My lord !
- my love !
- my Albert !
[ Throws herself into his arms as he enters . ]


Albert .
My sweet Constantia !
- Nay , I pr ` ythee check This transport , that doth shake thy tender frame Almost to fainting .


Constantia .
I would fain be strong , Be rational - be calm - but ` twill not be .
My wayward heart , so long unused to joy , Heaves with such wild convulsive throbs to meet it , As shake the pow ` rs of life !
Oh , thou unkind one !
But I will not complain : - the sacred vow That bound me to thee at the holy altar , Binds not the heart alone  my will is thine !
Yet blame me not , if , on the verge of being , Unown'd - unhonour'd - nay , perhaps , unlov'd - I grasp the little good that fate allows me , With painful extasy !


Albert .
The little , say ` st thou !
Oh , had Constantia still retain'd that passion Which once shot roseate blushes o'er her cheek , Lived in her accent , languish'd in her eye , And gave each charm its own ethereal lustre  Then had she met me with a joy so pure , It had defied the feeble pow ' r of fate To dash it with a care .
- Nay , pr ` ythee smile !
Or I shall think thou art a very wife , And mean ` st to chide thy truant .


Constantia .
Dearest Albert !
When , dear to gratitude 's commanding voice , And reckless of my virgin fame , I dared To plight in secret an unsanctioned vow , I lost that peace which is the life of virtue .
Yet thou wert mine  and my idolatrous heart Liv'd on the certitude : - till losing that , I 'd well nigh lost life too !
Hours , days , and months , Have past in sad and sober recollection Since last we met : - and still , as they 've gone by , Some early flow ' r of fancy and of youth Hath droop'd the head and wither'd : - firmer reason Alone increased in vigour - spread its foliage , Wholesome , but chilling , o'er a thankless soil .


Albert .
If this same reason makes my fair one sad , I 'll not a leaf o n't - 't is a bitter plant !
- Come , come , I know this pretty self-reproach Tends , like the veil coquetry bids you draw O'er brightest eyes , to make the dart more sure .
But tell me , love - in those same months thou speak ` st of , Those tedious months of absence - Has they tongue - It were a venial trespass - Has it never - I could not chide an ` twere so - Ne'er betray'd The mystery of our union ?


Constantia .
Never .


Albert .
How ?
In the soft hours of confidence and friendship , Ne'er hinted - smiled - or blushed away the secret ?


Constantia .
Oh , never !


Albert .
The good priest too -


Constantia .
I had wrote thee , Or I mistake , that heav'n long since had call'd him .


Albert .
'T is true  I had forgot .
- [ aside ] Heav'n was most gracious To further deeds in which heav'n has no share .
[ To her ] His fate was sudden too - But he was pious : And pious minds are never unprepared For their great audit .


Constantia .
Happy who , like him , Have early closed the various page of life , And lifting the dim view from hence on high , Have traced the sacred characters of heav ` n !


Albert [ aside ] .
Most beauteous saint !
Now , by my life , those charms Might warm an anchorite .
An anchorite , said I !
Weak fires may thaw - She , planet-like , has spells To rule the boundless ocean of ambition !
I shall be lost !


Constantia .
Trust me , my love , thou ` rt chang'd too !
Even mid the pomp and splendour of a court , Thy heart , perchance , is sick !


Albert [ aside ] .
My reason rather !


Constantia .
Some lovelier fair -


Albert .
I should have curs'd the tongue , Had it been aught but thine , that dared suggest it !
Hear , and believe me , dearest , when I swear , In all the tedious hours I 've past without thee , Ne'er hath my wandering eye encountered beauty , But it hath breath'd a sigH for my Constantia !
And yet , my love -


Constantia .
Ah !
What ?


Albert .
Thou should ` st be great , Be noble .
- Nature , when she gave thee beauty , Matchless , imperial beauty - gave a claim That might have bankrupt fortune 's richest means  But treacherous love has marr'd the glorious gift , And cast thee on a beggar .


Constantia .
Art thou one ?


Albert .
Clouded the fair perfection of that form , That should have blaz'd , like a bright wand ` ring star , The wonder of the hemisphere - in darkness , Obscurity , and sorrow .


Constantia .
Is it sorrow To call thee mine ?
To spend my painful vigils In dwelling on thy memory ?
and in pray ' r That when Constantia silent sleeps in dust , Thou may ` st be happy !


Albert .
Dost thou love me , then ?


Constantia .
Love you !
Oh , heavens !


Albert .
Now with your sex 's passion  With jealousy , with tears , with fond endearment : But with a flame so generous and so noble , That it could soar beyond their feeble ken , And aim at manly daring !


Constantia .
Name your proof !


Albert .
Could it renounce the selfish claims of wife ?
Rich in my fortunes , richer in my love , Assert its empire o'er my heart alone , And leave the world a name ?


Constantia [ disordered ] .
How should I answer To what I understand not ?


Albert .
To be plain  Thou know ` st my means ill suited to my birth .
- Honour and fame are mine : but wealth - the dross , The clay in which we build those tott ` ring fabrics , Must be acquired by art .
- Roselva 's heiress -


Constantia [ faintly ] .
Pr ` ythee no more !


Albert .
Nay shrink not !
- To hear half Were but to blast thee .


Constantia .
I am blasted now !
Oh heav ` n !
- Oh earth !
- Can it be possible ?
Wouldst thou thus coolly meditate destruction ?
Thus spread a wide accumulating ruin ?
A ruin , that would mock sweet mercy 's pow ' r To raise it from the dust !


Albert [ impatiently ] .
Art mad ?


Constantia .
Past cure !
Ev'n at the moment when my fleeting sense Hung on thy image  and enfeebled life Stood tott ` ring on the precipice of fate , Then , then to plunge me down the vast profound , Ev'n with the outstretch'd arm that seem'd to save me !
Oh , merciless !


Albert [ seizing her hand roughly ] .
Peace !
Peace !


Constantia [ wildly ] .
Where shall I find it ?
The cherub sits in heav ` n , and mocks my pray ` r !
The earth is cover'd with a mist of crimes That hides her from our view !
See , how it thickens !
All 's black - All 's dark !
- Thy hand - We 're lost !
- Oh , mercy !
[ she faints . ]


Albert .
I am a devil !
and have dispossest An angel 's reason !


Constantia [ recovering ] .
Art thou there , my Albert ?
Oh , I 've had dreams .
But thou art by to shield me !


Albert .
Rest then on me .


Constantia .
My brain is all confusion : This weakness is most strange !
for I have ta'en Of those same powders , that you sent me , oft .


Albert [ starting ] .
Indeed !


Constantia .
Nay , but this very morn , to chear our meeting , And give the name of Health to ` t , I had swallow'd The cordial draught thy tender care prepared For my worst need .


Albert .
Oh heav ` n !


Constantia .
Did I not right ?
Nay , trust me , love , it cheared me much  yet now , I know not wherefore , all things swim before me .
'T is but a moment since methought thy form Assumed some horrid semblance .


Albert .
Rest will chear thee .


Constantia [ as she goes out ] .
When shall we meet again ?


Albert [ disturbed ] .
To-morrow .


Constantia .
Here ?


Albert [ with increasing perturbation ] .
Yes , here .


Constantia .
'T is well  I shall remember .
[ Exit into a chamber . ]


Albert .
Aye , indeed !
Your memory will be long then  and must reach Ev'n to that gloom where fancy 's self expires .
Constantia , thou art lost !
And the black venom That taints thy blood , has , with infectious pow ` r , Stol'n o'er my heart , and poison'd all its joys .
Away , remorse !
- the deed that 's past must be As it had never been !
[ Going out , he meets the Count and Countess . ]


Count Roselva .
My noble guest , You 're well encounter'd - Start not thus , my daughter : Lord Albert bears no terrors .


Albert [ still disturbed ] .
Good my Lord -


Count Roselva .
Nay , gentle Albert , fathers have a privilege To wave the forms of sex .


Albert [ to the Countess ] .
Dared I believe -


Countess .
My Lord , you have a secret monitor , Without presumption , well may bid you trust To what you wish .
- I do beseech you , spare me !
Some two hours hence my father will impart What conscious honour , and , I hope , a sense Of nature 's rights , may dictate .
Rest we thus : Roselva 's heiress can not be unconscious Of Lord Alberto 's worth .


Albert [ laying his hand on his breast ] .
My thanks are here .
[ Exit . ]


Count Roselva .
Why dost thou trifle thus ?
Why dress thy tongue In dubious promises ?


Countess .
Oh , rather , why Must I debase truth 's everlasting lustre With vile equivocation ?


Count Roselva .
Thou art chang'd .
I deem'd thee duteous : trust me I can change too !
Has then a parent 's voice no pow ' r to awe ?
I gave thee life !


Countess .
You gave me more ev ` n  virtue !
Reason , the glorious pow ' r to judge of wrong  And courage to declare .
Nay , dear my father , Look not upon me with an angry eye : I am your daughter , tutor'd by your cares  And can I , in one selfish hour , forget Each nobler principle those cares have cherish'd ?
You had a thousand , thousand claims to urge you : Aspiring manhood  pride  unheeded sorrows  The fond excesses of parental love : All that could tempt the proud , or warm the injured .
But I - a creature nursed in luxury , Whose every feeling , polish'd even to weakness , Starts at the thought of wrong - shall I inflict it ?
Inflict it on a helpless - suffering friend ?
Bid me do this , and tremble at the future !
Tremble at the black list of nameless crimes Such monstrous guilt may gender !


Count Roselva .
Thou perverse one !
But well I guess thy secret soul assigns Motives more pow ` rful than this fine-spun honour , To tempt thee from they duty .
- Sigismond -


Countess .
Nay , wrong me not so far !
- Tho ' my heart cherish'd A passion dearer than its vital flood  Tho ' all of happiness concentred there Left nought to virtue but her own bright record  I call attesting angels down to witness That I would bid my stubborn senses yield , And own her voice in yours !
Yet hear me swear too By that same heav'n whose sacred mandate bids Not to inflict what we should grieve to suffer , That while my lov'd Constantia lives to claim them , Ne'er shall my treach ` rous pow ' r invade her rights : Ne'er shall my secret soul conceive the wish , Nor my base tongue pronounce th ' unhallow'd vow , That thus would sanction fraud .


Count Roselva .
Is 't possible ?
Away , ingrate !
- Oh thou dost plant fresh thorns , When thy soft hand alone could pluck out those That cruel memory fixt here !
Get thee hence !
I will but con a lesson of humility , And follow thee anon .
- Yes - 't is most fit That I should learn to be an infant 's vassal .
My knees are old and stubborn - but they 'll bend  At least to heav'n - and then - no matter - hence .


Countess .
I dare not leave you .


Count Roselva .
You have dared do that To which all future darings are as feathers In the scale of nature .


Countess .
Oh , my father !


Count Roselva .
Away , thou ` lt drive me desperate !


Theresa [ without ] .
Help ho !
help there !


Count Roselva .
What cry was that ?


Theresa [ entering from one of the arched doors ] .
The lady Constantia , Sir , Demands your instant succour .


Count Roselva .
Say ` st thou ?


Countess .
Heavens !


Theresa .
Half frantic - flutt ` ring on the verge of being , By fits she lives , and dies .
- See - see - she 's here !


Constantia [ led in from the same door ] .
Air - air - more air - Oh , you have cruel kindness !
Why do you hold me thus ?
- You choak - you kill me !
Aye - here I breathe more freely !


Count Roselva .
Sweet Constantia , Give me thy hand .


Constantia .
And my pulse too , I warrant !
No - no - no more of medicine - it hath kill'd me .


Count Roselva .
Hath medicine kill'd thee ?


Constantia .
Aye - a villain 's , Sir ?


Count Roselva [ in disorder ] .
I gave her none !


Physician .
My Lord !


Countess .
Alas !
she wanders !


Physician .
It is not strange .
Exhausted nature oft , When she hath lost her pure and healthful spring , Genders strange meteors and wild fiery starts , The offspring of corruption .
- Yet this morn I found her calm and temp ` rate  - she 's much chang'd .


Countess .
But not to death !


Physician .
Would , Madam , I could say so !


Countess .
Oh no - it can not be !
- she whose fair cheek So lately shamed the morning !
- whose firm pulse Beat with the steady tone of health and virtue !


Constantia [ drawing her hand from that of the Countess , and looking at it ] .
What 's here ?
- a tear - a soft and gracious drop From orbs of mercy - I can feel its influence - Mark you how it hath cool'd me !


Countess .
Cooled thee , say ` st thou ?
Death 's in this hand .


Count Roselva .
Her fever is most potent .


Constantia [ gazing earnestly around ] .
Is there none else here ?


Count Roselva .
None , dear sufferer !
Whom would ` st thou ?


Constantia .
Nobody - no matter - yet .
Methinks there should be eyes , that , for each tear You drop , should rain down torrents .
Oh , that pang !
One more such , and all 's past .


Countess .
Is there no aid ?


Physician .
None , Madam , that my skill can minister .
The powers of life are wasted  - life itself Hangs like a leaf upon a sapless branch , Which the first breath may shake .


Countess .
Yet youth like hers -


Constantia [ wildly ] .
Who talks of life and youth ?
I am wither'd - feeble !
Grief hath struck palsies here [ laying her hand on her heart ] - Feel how it trembles !
And now - Oh , agony !
- You tear it from me !
[ repels the Countess ] .
Spare me !
- Oh , spare my heart-strings !


Countess .
Gracious heaven , I do submit me to thy will .
Oh , take her !
And with these drops of painful resignation , May every selfish and repining thought Be blotted from my soul !


Physician .
Repose her here .
[ a small sopha is brought ]


Constantia [ reviving ] .
Why stand ye so far off ?


Count Roselva .
Sweet , we are near thee .


Constantia .
Nay , nay , ye are not - and your voices too !
So low - so distant - that mine ear scarce catches - - Light there !
- more light - [ starting forward ] - Mind eyes are dim too .
Oh !
- [ she dies ]


Countess .
Too much of sorrow !


Theresa .
Help there - Raise her !


Count Roselva [ dropping the lifeless hand ] .
No !
- 'T is past .
- She 's dead : and that ethereal essence That gave the flow ' r its soft and living perfume , Is lost in air .


Physician .
Look to the Countess there !


Count Roselva .
Bear in the beauteous clay !
[ The sopha is borne off  the Count takes his daughter in his arms , and signs to the attendants , who follow the body . ]
My child - My dear one !
Nay ope thine eyes !


Countess .
They are turn'd inward , Sir !
And there have learnt a lesson of submission .
I am awe-struck , and own the voice of heav ` n. Roselva hath no heiress now but me  And I no will but yours .


Count Roselva .
Still then thou ` rt duteous !
Trust me , my child , I would not urge thy will , Did I not see a train of happy days Rise from this mournful hour .


Countess .
Perhaps they may so .
One at least is rescued From the black list , when I obey a father .
This night , with your good leave , I would devote To pray ' r for my lov'd friend .
- To-morrow 's sun Shall find a joyless , but obedient heart , Ready , an it shall please lord Albert claim it , To yield its plighted vow .
One boon alone : That , faithful to the business of the state , He part o ' the instant .
Our less urgent haste May claim some few days ' respite !


Count Roselva .
At thy wish !
I will not wrong the virtue of thy sorrow By ill-tim'd festivals .
Yet pr ` ythee chear thee !


Countess .
Nay let me weep , my father .
Dews like these Are blasting only to the weeds of life  The virtues bloom beneath them .
Sacred tears !
How many soft and tender courtesies , How many graces , that rapacious death Has snatch'd from vulgar vision , new embodied , Through your bright medium rise again to being , Ting'd warm and high with colourings divine !
[ Exeunt . ]


END OF ACT II


Act III


Act III


Scene 1


[ A garden belonging to the Castle .
Osmond and the Physician . ]


Physician .
NUPTIALS so secret and so sudden , blending festivity as it were with tears , and mirth with mortality !
By my faith , Master Osmond , but this is strange !
the Lady Constantia was surely well beloved ?


Osmond .
By the Count most tenderly , and by the Countess to the very extremity of passion .
Even now hast she past the live-long night , surrounded by her maids , in grief and meditation  interrupted only by the prayer which they chanted in unison at each returning hour : till morn drew forth a requiem , whose notes swell'd with a harmony so sober and so sad , that methought it might have charm'd the disembodied spirit , and call'd it back to earth !
Oh , never was love more perfect , or more true !
Joy was not joy , till it was shared with Constantia  nor did sorrow ever cloud the brow of either till she sickened .


Physician .
And that , as I take it , was some twelvemonth past : yet did the deadliness of her distemper never manifest itself till within the last twelve hours  and then with a suddenness !
- Hinted you to the Count what we talked of , as to the manner of her death ?


Osmond .
I did , Sir .


Physician .
And how received he it ?


Osmond .
At first somewhat moodily - yet with a certain strangeness that led me to bolder speech : till , on the mention of poison , he started from his seat with a petrifying frown , chid my presumption , that dar'd rashly question the decrees of heaven - enjoined my silence - and so dismissed me .


Physician .
Even so !


Osmond .
With no further shew of zeal .


Physician .
Alas !
that affection should prove a still frailer flower than morality .
Yet this passes not so .
- Osmond , I do once more repeat to thee , I like not the hastiness of her death .
The Lord Albert stands high in the calendar of courtiers , but not of saints  and my mind hath misgivings more than my tongue dare utter .
Should the workings of my fancy bear further test , thou shalt know more  in the interim , counsel with they discretion , and obey the mandate of thy lord .
Thou art moved .


Osmond .
Truly , Sir , both with amazement and sorrow .
There was no heart so mean that it felt not the virtues of the Lady Constantia  nor any , I trow , so base that it would not avenge the innocent .


Physician .
Aye , Osmond , there is the test that lifts the poor man to the prince - the servant to his lord  that alone equalizes ranks , and raises up the weak to befriend that cause which the mighty abandon .
- Past not the Lord Sigismond thro ' yon trees ?


Osmond .
Rather the semblance of the Lord Sigismond - a body without a soul : - a creature so lost , that , seeing him , we might well weep over the wreck of a man  and marvel that the vehemence of one passion should so o'er-master the boasted omnipotence of reason .


Physician .
There are no hearts more true than those that are touch'd with this noble energy : nor any remedy so prompt for our own sufferings , as that of righting the cause of others .
Sigismond is discreet and valiant - I will unbosom myself to him .
- I have yet some portion of the drugs - I will analyze them .
- Theresa must again be questioned .
- All shall be examined  and where the black speck is , there must we apply the caustic .
- But soft  the Count !
- He seems disturb'd too -


Osmond .
I can not marvel , Sir - Our new-made bridegroom , with love that somewhat oversteps the bounds of plighted honour , sets his loyalty and speed aside  delays his purposed parting till morrow 's dawn  and with a certain zeal that clothes a harsh command in gentle phrase , wooes his fair bride with him to court - while she -


Physician .
` Twere best pass on !


Osmond .
Have with you !


Physician .
Towards the castle !
[ Exeunt . ]


[ Count Roselva enters , followed by Rodolphus . ]


Count Roselva .
I 'm sick - at rest - I 'll not be further mov'd - So tell him , good Rodolphus !
He doth wrong The nobleness of his word , to press a suit , Which in my very heat and zeal of friendship I did deny to him .
My daughter 's his , Fast as the sacred pow ' r of oaths can bind her .
For her seclusion and her sequent journey She had my licence  aye , and his I trow , Ev'n when he had no privilege to make The law by which he bound her !
- You 've my answer - Where stays he , Sir ?


Rodolphus .
I ' the castle , good my Lord  Where he hath vainly sought you .


Count Roselva .
I would have him Still seek me vainly !
We 've conferr'd already  And I do feel a hasty spleen within , That bids me shun his presence .
- If it suit With what imports the business of the state , That he make longer sojourn - all my means Are at his beck - while gallant preparation Shall wait him to the court .
And for my daughter , The treasures of her love , and of her fortune , Will both be his - till then , my word is sacred !
I will not urge her further - So report it .
[ Exit Rodolphus . ]
Osmond !


Osmond [ entering ] .
My Lord !


Count Roselva [ to himself ] .
The heav ` ns , methinks , do lour !
And guilt , that still engenders superstition , Doth whisper that they frown on this day 's deed !
- The time is changed , good Osmond !


Osmond .
To a wonder !
The moon , so lately ris ` n , is loft .
- The air , Heavy and thick , is sunk to sudden stillness : While the streaked bosom of yon nitrous clouds Portends intestine war - [ Distant chorus ] .
`` Peace - `` Peace to the lovely and the good ! ''


Count Roselva .
What music 's that ?


Osmond .
The villagers , my Lord , still chanting requiems O'er fair Constantia 's grave .
A rustic tribute , With which they meant to wake the silent night , And hang on beauty 's shrine with simple garland , More wet with tears than dew  the brooding storm I fear doth mock their humble gratitude , And urge them homeward !
Hark , my Lord , the thunder , Ev'n now in hoarse and fearful mutterings , Warns you to shelter !
'T is but two months past The rifted bolt did cleave yon solid oak , And plough the land around .


Count Roselva [ to himself ] .
Why should I shake ?
- She 's dead - the ravenous grave hath swallow'd her  Yet all 's not well here  and th ` offended heav ` ns Do of our granted wishes make a scourge , To lash us into torture .
- She died fairly !
But where 's the voucher ?
A wrong'd heritage !
A nameless orphan suddenly cut off , Ev'n at the moment - fye !
- there 's that i ' the face o n't Would blast an angel 's witness .
- Well , we 'll in  There is more war than in the elements  But where 's the shelter ?
Would she lived again .
[ Exit abruptly . ]


Osmond [ solus ] .
He 's deeply mov'd - nor can I wonder at it .
The potent duty that did bind my lady To yield her hand , had yet no pow ' r to quell Her heart 's wild swells : - tears - tremor - and depression , Ev'n in the presence of the sacred altar , Chased the bright flush of youth from off her cheek , And stained the nuptial wreathes !
Good night , Rodolphus !


Rodolphus .
Good night - good night - No time for ceremony !
The storm is at our heels .
Hot sulph ` rous drops Dry as they fall upon the earth 's parch'd bosom , Or else conglobe to dust !
My Lord 's retired !
I 've borne the message of your testy Count  The Countess mocks his suit too .
- For mine own part Having no love thoughts to disturb my slumbers , My truckle bed is welcome .


[ Chorus at a distance ] .
`` Peace ! ''


Rodolphus .
List , I pray you !


Chorus .
`` Peace to the lovely and the good ! ''


Rodolphus .
'T is heav ` nly music , sure !


Osmond .
Alas !
mere mortal , Wailing mortality !


Semi-chorus .
`` Rash humanity forbear !
`` Heave not a sigh , nor drop a tear !
`` When tumultuous feelings rove , `` Warm with hope , with youth , and love  `` When contending passions fly , `` To bend and languish in the eye  `` When the throbbing blood bids start `` Thousand pulses from the heart  `` When the trembling senses seek `` A crimson harbour in the cheek  `` Then is the time to drop the tear : `` Now rash humanity forbear ! ''


Chorus .
`` Peace to the lovely and the good ! ''


Semi-chorus .
`` Pain and sorrow now are o'er : `` The eye that wept shall weep no more .
`` No more the anxious heart shall sigh , `` Whelm'd in doubtful extasy .
`` Lo , where in their little cell , `` Unwak'd the tranquil senses dwell  `` Steep'd no more in sorrow 's flood !
`` Peace to the lovely and the good ! ''


[ The chorus dies insensibly away , and the villagers are seen passing through the trees , strewing flowers .
- Low thunder . ]


[ SCENE - The Countess 's chamber  - a bed - Lights burning on the table .
- The Countess and Theresa . ]


Countess .
Thou ` rt spent with watching , girl - get thee to bed .


Theresa .
Sooth I 'm not weary , Madam !


Countess .
Kind Theresa !
Who thus would ` st strain the offices of duty , Till nature faint .
What wonder that thine eyes Should claim their wonted dues , when mine , ev'n mine , With tears half glaz'd , with anxious thoughts kept waking , Feeble and dim scarce lift the heavy lid !


Theresa .
Permit me , Madam , watch you !


Countess .
That were cruel !
Thou ` rt human , good Theresa , and dost want Humanity 's soft balm .
Why dost thou tarry ?
Fear ` st thou the storm ?
Methinks th ` enkindled flame , If to the guilty it doth speak a pow ' r That in reproving shakes them , - yet in breasts , Whose natural whiteness bears no stain of guilt , Tho ' fill'd with contrite sense of human error , Should gender nothing , save the holy awe That sanctifies the bosom .
Courage , girl !


Theresa .
Madam , I fear it not .


Countess .
Yet somewhat fear ` st thou !


Theresa .
You , and you only .


Countess .
Me !
alas , vain greatness !
Hast thou then witchery enough to deck A puny mortal like myself in terrors ?
Speak thine offence !


Theresa .
Behold it , madam !
[ Pointing to Sigismond , who enters . ]


Countess [ starting ] .
How !
- Was this well done , my Lord ?


Sigismond .
Was it well done To bar me from thy presence ?
- to cut off Ev'n the faint memory of the hours that were , And doom me to oblivion ?
Oh thou false one !
Why didst thou smile to lure me to destruction ?
Why did thine eyes blend their sparkling beams With these fond orbs  and bid my throbbing heart Burn with a hope so ardent and so fierce , That life itself , heav 'n' s own celestial flame , Grew pale and dim before it ?


Countess [ tenderly ] .
Sigismond !


Sigismond .
No sigh - no tear , I charge thee , lest they blast me !
Lest my responsive heart forget its wrongs , And fondly yield thee its accustom'd echo .
I come to close my great account of anguish !
To banish in one parting - deep-drawn sigh , All the vast agonies of hopeless passion : To bid thee live - to joy - to love - to fortune !


Countess .
I pr ` ythee spare me , gentle Sigismond !
If thou would ` st have my heart forbear to break , If thou would ` st have my tott ` ring reason keep Her throne secure , breathe no kind wish upon me !
Joy - fortune - love - Oh , they were wand ` ring vapours , My tears long since have quench'd !


Sigismond .
Thy tears - Oh heav ` n !
Where is the pang should wring from thee those drops ?
Hast thou e'er known the gloom of secret anguish , Or the wild transport of a dawning joy ?
Wakes not the boundless universe for thee ?
Thee happy Albert leads to grace a court !
Thee , happier still , shall woo in rural shades !
While smiling fortune , and indulgent heaven , Shall ratify the bliss !
- the world is thine !
I had no world but love - no heav'n but hope !
Why didst thou steal upon the treasured store , And rob the wretched miser while he dreamt Of years of extasy ?


Countess .
Away , forget me !
I would , alas , forget myself !
- forget All worldly hopes - all joys - all fleeting pleasures .
Why com ` st thou then like some bright vision by me , Startling my slumb ` ring sense with transient gleams Of unknown happiness ?
- the few short hours Since last we met , a point to happy mortals , Have been my round of life !


Sigismond .
Dost thou then mourn them ?


Countess .
I mourn them not - they were the mark'd of fate  And filial duty and applauding conscience Shall bear them white to heav ` n : - yet still for thee -


Sigismond [ approaching ] .
For me thy tears !
Oh , give the precious balm !
And let me lay it to my burning heart !


Countess .
Away -


Sigismond .
Born to subdue each stormy passion , Still thou prevail ` st - and yet methinks the words Should be more kind that bid us part for ever !
Some token too - some pledge -


Countess [ taking a chain and ornament from her neck ] .
How much I owe thee , Honour and inborn gratitude attest !
Thou wert my guardian angel - my preserver !
Oh , that my pray ` rs could make this sad memorial A precious amulet !
- that it might shield thee , Ev'n as a sacred charm , ` mid wars and dangers !
It was Constantia 's - wear it at thy heart !
And sometimes , as thou sadly dost peruse it , Recall the memory of the friends that lov'd thee , And gem it with a tear !
- [ Gives it him ]


Sigismond .
My senses fail me !
This , said you - this ?


Countess .
The wonder !


Sigismond [ wild and fearful ] .
They are the same - [ Comparing it with another from his own bosom . ]
The form - th ' impress - the chain  The cypher only differing .
- Do not mock me !
The Turk that tore me from my native land , Oft , in my playful hours of childish fondness , To this sad relic drew the unconscious tear  And bade me , should my fortunes e'er encounter Its likeness in some wand ` ring fair one 's bosom , Beware a sister there !


Countess [ with transport ] .
All-righteous heav ` n , There is joy yet !
- the heirship is restored !
Smile - smile again , Roselva !
- ye wide plains Whose princely wealth my thankless heart so oft Hath inly mourn'd , put forth your richest treasures !
Rise , ye proud turrets , with unwonted lustre , And grace your rightful lord !
- To heav'n and him , I bend my knee !


Sigismond [ raising her ] .
What means this wild emotion ?


Countess [ with sudden recollection ] .
My father - ruined - lost - betray'd - by me - Oh my sick heart !
[ clap of thunder . ]


Sigismond .
The fierce and rending tempest Doth shake thy constancy !


Countess .
Ah no !
- the storm Is here , my Sigismond , to which I bend !
- That fortune yet reserves for thee her treasures , I do intreat thy credence .


Sigismond .
Thou art faint !


Countess .
Joy hath its agonies !
Get - get thee hence !
Of the strange mystery that veils thy fate - We meet again - [ with embarrassment . ]


Sigismond .
Oh never !


Countess .
Trust me yes !


Sigismond .
Trust thee , thou dear one !
- Oh those heavy eyes !
In sickness and in sorrow lovely still !
May some pure angel , like thyself , be near , And guard thy slumbers .
[ Kisses her hand , and exit . ]


Countess .
Hear the pray ` r , Constantia !
And if enfranchis'd spirits walk on earth , Let thy fair semblance hover round my bed !
Shield from blasting storm - the midnight ruffian , And from the realms of sanctitude and peace Breathe o'er my senses some celestial dream , May soothe this mortal coil !
- Methinks ev'n now They 're rapt in sweet foretaste - heavy - most heavy !
[ She sleeps . ]


[ The Scene changes to the arched gallery as before , lighted by a lamp from the roof .
Albert enters through his chamber-door , speaking to Rodolphus , whose pallet is visible from the lights within .
- Thunder at intervals , with vivid flashes of lightning seen through the casements . ]


Albert .
See that the tapers burn - and then to bed .
Are the heavens angry , that they chide us thus ?
An ` twere their will to visit sinful heads , I well might fear now !
- Yet the forked flash Past innocent - and feeble-minded man Betrays himself .
- It is the hour of rest !
And all the mingled sounds that swell'd so late Thro ' the low vaults and hollows of the castle , Are sunk to stillness .
Thought 's fantastic brood Alone is waking : - present - past , and future , Wild , mis-shaped hopes , and horrible rememb ` rings , Now rise a hideous and half viewless chaos To fancy 's vision - till the stout heart freeze At its own retrospect .
- Mem ` ry , stop there !
Not a jot further !
- Rather , thou bright sun , Thou dazzling future , rise with godlike splendour , And gild the vast horizon of ambition .
Say it be clouded by a woman 's will !
Yet is she woman - therefore to be lured  A young one - therefore to be bribed by gauds : And I will tempt her with such golden glories As her weak sex would grasp at , tho ' perdition Gaped in the gulf between !
- This is her chamber !
Perchance she sleeps unguarded - at the worst , A lover 's passion , and a husband 's right , Shall justify th ' intrusion !
- Who dare bar me ?
[ The Ghost of Constantia , shrouded in the lightest white drapery , appears before the door , passing the pallet of Rodolphus , who sleeps sweetly . ]
Ha !
have my senses conjured up a phantom ?
Speak , vision , if thou canst !
[ advancing . ]
[ She gazes intently , and motions him from her . ]
Oh horrible !
[ He leans against a pillar . ]
[ Vivid lightning - the Ghost glides into the chamber of the Countess . ]
Albert [ after a pause ] .
I am a coward - and my fears have shaped The thing that is not .
- Yet I saw it plain - Most manifest to view .
Nor , tho ' the heav ` ns had shower'd down sheets of fire , Could it have so appall'd me .
- What , Rodolphus !
Rodolphus , I say - So , Sir you sleep sound !


Rodolphus [ starting up ] .
Aye , truly , do I my Lord - Sound sleep is the patrimony of honest poverty .
My family had the trick o n't , and 't was all my father had to bequeath me .
[ Thunder . ]


Albert [ starting wildly ] .
Soft , Sirs !


Rodolphus My Lord !


Albert [ to himself ] .
I 've faced the deadly cannon While its dread roaring hath mowed ranks before it : Have danced unshrinking on the curling billows When they have dash'd the clouds , and death beneath Hath worn its grimmest form  and start I now ?
Ev'n at the shrouded and the bloodless semblance That fancy had embodied !


Rodolphus [ with great surprize ] .
He 's entranced !
Good - good my Lord .


Albert .
Who 's there ?


Rodolphus Heav'n and his saints have mercy on us !
How wildly your Lordship looks - Do you see aught , Sir ?
- These dismal old arches put one in mind of nothing but murders and apparitions .


Albert .
Peace , coward !


Rodolphus .
Beseech you then go in , my Lord : I have some curious relics to guard us , and - hark !
- No - it was only the whistling of the wind - And yet methought it was very like a groan .
- [ observing the perturbation of Albert ] By my troth , my Lord , you 're pale - i ` faith you are so .


Albert [ striking him ] .
Lying fool , begone !


Rodolphus .
Nay , no liar , I swear - nor so much of a fool as not to know that if rank has its privileges , age and fidelity are not without theirs .
I humbly wish your Lordship a good night .
And when you have a follower more faithful than myself , may heaven and you reward him as he deserves !


Albert .
Stay , sirrah !
Mastered every way - come - come - there 's gold for thee !


Rodolphus [ rejecting it ] .
Ah my Lord , my Lord , thus does your grandee ever think he can purchase by wealth what he hath lost by discourtesy .
- But keep your gold , Sir !
- I have somewhat here that tells me I was not born a slave , but a man - A poor one I must own  yet still a man : with feelings that will not be commanded , and opinions that are not to be bought .


Albert .
Thou ` rt born a babbling knave , Sir !
quit my sight , Now , and for ever !
- Chased by slaves and ideots !
Begone , Sir !
[ Thunder .
Albert looking after Rodolphus who slowly retires . ]
He may brave the thunder storm  Darkness and midnight bring to him no spectres : Honest and humble .
- Would I were so too !


Rodolphus [ still lingering ] .
Has your Lordship then no further duty to enjoin me ?


Albert [ in a subdued tone ] .
None - none - begone , I tell thee !


Rodolphus .
An yet , if it were not too bold , I would fain kiss your Lordship 's hand before I quit your service - and - and - By the mass it is cold as death !
- Ah , my dear Lord [ falling on his knees ] - My sweet Lord - My honoured Lord - tell your griefs to your poor servant !
- If he be but your servant , yet hath he a heart that would break to relieve yours - and tho ' this be the hand the struck me , yet many and many 's the time it hath twisted its fingers in my grey locks , while , with childish fondness , you swore ever to love your poor Rodolphus .


Albert .
Thou wilt unman me !
Oh , tyrannic guilt , That dost disclaim all balm of confidence , And leave the lacerated heart to groan In solitary anguish !
- Happy he Who sinking on the bosom of a friend Inhales the honied breath of sympathy , And yields to short oblivion .
[ Falls on the neck of Rodolphus . ]


Rodolphus .
A murrain o'these half sentences !
What signifies a man 's telling himself his own griefs !


Albert .
Come - come - all 's well again !
- 't was but a chill .
Tell me , Rodolphus - the - the fair Constantia - Art sure she 's dead ?


Rodolphus .
And buried too - You may well think of her , my Lord  she was a sweet creature  and loved you so truly - I dreamt of her ev'n now - Methought she stood as it ` twere there , and smiled upon me with the same rosy and kind air she was wont to have when I first followed your Lordship to the castle .
Troth , her first night 's lodging i ` the ground is but comfortless .
Well , all 's one for that - the same storm beats on the grave of the prince and the peasant  and both , perhaps , sleep sweeter than he who lives to mourn them !


Albert .
Wounded by random shafts - Most subtle torture !
Well , well , enough of this .


Rodolphus .
And yet not all either , my Lord , if we could come at the truth - there 's a strange muttering i ` the castle , as tho ' she had not been dealt fairly with - I shall know more anon !


Albert .
Rather know less , Sir !
Curb this intemperate and boorish zeal That - hark - a noise - Startled again by shadows !


Rodolphus .
Shadow call you it !
by my troth then it is the shadow of a drum  and , to my thinking , the voice of the Count .
[ Alarm , and shouts without . ]
The infidels - the Turks - arm , arm !


Albert .
What should this mean ?


Count Roselva [ entering ] .
Havock and desolation !
Ev'n now a savage and a fierce banditti , Led by the Othman pow ` r , invades our lands , And drives our slaves before it !


Albert .
Oh , most welcome !
Welcome thou stern and bloody front of war , Whose very voice doth wake my lagging spirits , And brace my unstrung sinews - trebly welcome !


Count Roselva .
Call forth our vassals - let the bridge be look'd to - Unbar the armoury , and chuse - Oh , Sigismond !


Sigismond [ entering ] .
My noble friend !


Count Roselva .
Thou has a valiant sword !


Sigismond .
And I , be sure , will use it valiantly !
And see , th ` inspiring angel comes to greet us .
[ The Countess enters from her chamber . ]
A thousand flushing terrors in her cheek , All guardian spirits - sent to summon up More than the strength of hosts in each beholder .


Albert [ interposing roughly ] .
Oh unmatch'd insolence !
Should I bear this , I were indeed a tame , convenient husband .


Count Roselva .
Heav'n shield my child - these frantic fits , Lord Albert -


Sigismond .
Nay , give the madman scope !
- didst thou say husband ?
As soon shall soul and deep engrained guilt Lay claim to heav ` n , as thou to her : - a husband !
Oh Albert , I could name to thee a crime , So deep , so dire , the fiends themselves might start , And wonder at its blackness !
Such a crime As strikes thee from humanity 's fair record , And cancels every tie .
- Let it suffice , I do attaint thee as a murderer !
And when our swords have thinned yon Turkish host , And thou return ` st , flush'd with familiar conquest , Ev'n in thy lustyhood and prime of daring , Will prove it on thy bosom !
Should I wrong thee , May the great God of battles blunt my steel , And seal a bloody pardon .


Albert .
Rather now Let fate decide between us !
Vagrant boaster !
Think ` st thou I 'd enter in the listed field , As knight to knight , with one my name might conquer ?
Know as a foe I scorn thee !
As an insect , Whose buzzing noise and sting offends my sense , I crush thee thus - [ Draws  the Count interposes . ]


Osmond [ entering ] .
My Lord , the foe advances !
Ev'n now the blaze of distant cottages Gains on the view .


Count Roselva .
Good Osmond , lead our vassals Forth by the nearer portal - [ To Albert and Sigismond ] Have you hearts ?
Myself will head them .
- Have you hearts , I say ?
Or are they cold , even as the steel ye bear ?


Sigismond .
I do confess me guilty !


Albert .
So do I - Our difference rest awhile upon our swords .
- Rodolphus - .


Rodolphus .
My good Lord !
[ they confer . ]


Count Roselva .
All-seeing heav ` n , If this hour of painful retribution , Some drop of mercy yet remains to mingle In the deep draught of sorrow , save my child !
Upon this guilty and time-silver'd head Discharge the bolt !
Oh , blast the wither'd trunk , But spare the blooming scion .
Faithful Osmond , Thy looks bespeak impatience : we will forth !
Forth !
to that strife whence some of us , perhaps , Will ne'er return !
And , oh , my noble guests , Rivals no more , but brothers of war , Give me your hands !
And if indeed ye cherish Aught of that gallant passion that doth lead To guard the helpless , and avenge the injured , Now let the flame blaze high !
A last embrace !
[ to his daughter . ]
Perhaps indeed a last one !
- I am lost In fearful recollection !
- Strike the drum !
And let the burning spirit of the war Exhale these watry vapours - Strike , I saw !
[ Alarm - Exeunt separately .
- Long and distant drums . ]


[ SCENE changes to the chapel of the Castle - a perspective view of the altar - On one side a tomb , as lately opened , hung with garlands of flowers .
- The Countess enters , followed by Osmond . ]


Countess .
Dreary and desolate !
The peopled castle , That late resounded with the hum of men , Now rings harsh echoes to a single step .
Methinks the pendant banners , as I pass , Fearful records of many a bloody field , Wave colder blasts upon me  while the spear And target , spoils of honourable valour , Clang self-impelled with horrid dissonance : The sighing winds come laden with lament , And nothing reigns but war and devastation !


Osmond .
Beseech you , Madam , hence !
- Unwholesome dews Still hang upon the bosom of the morn , And taint the breeze .


Countess .
Oh Osmond , night 's dank dews , Or burning noon , alike unheeded , strike On her whose sense concentred to her heart , Lives only there !
Nay , pr ` ythee tell me , Osmond , In the vast regions of created space , Is there one spot like this , where I could shelter ?
Here the rude clangor of the distant field Strikes feebly on my senses .
Heav'n and friendship With more than mortal influence guard the ground .
Here lie the sacred treasures of remembrance !
They fade not with yon garlands - Lost Constantia !
Devoted - murdered - Hold , my bleeding heart !
Nor burst beneath the strange , the black idea .


Osmond .
Have comfort , Madam !


Countess .
Still my burning blood , Bid my tumultuous pulse subside to calmness  Curb the wild swells that , mounting from my heart , Threaten my brain !
Oh , Osmond , there are crimes Which , in a mind unversed , and new to horror , Awake a sense so strange and turbulent , That reason faints before it .
- Ha , what noise !


Uberto [ entering hastily ] .
A messenger , an please you , from my Lord , Craves audience .


Countess .
Oh , admit him on the instant !
Fool that thou wert to dally - Well , thy tidings ?
[ to the Messenger who enters . ]


Messanger .
Most luckless - Prest by the surrounding foe , My Lord craves instant succour !


Countess .
Heav'n and earth !
Surrounded , say ` st thou ?
Oh , he 's lost  he 's lost !
Haste , Osmond !
Speed thy followers to my father !
Danger and death are on him .


Osmond .
Gentle Lady -


Countess .
Nay , speak not - look not as thou mean ` st to dally .
While we , cool sceptics , calculate the danger , He perishes .


Osmond .
Where doth the combat press thus ?


Messenger .
Ev'n in the hollow of the left hand vale , Where the broad umbrage gains upon the road , The ambush'd foe rush'd on us .


Osmond .
Noble Madam , Think of your danger , if , alone and guardless , I violate the mandate of my Lord , And leave -


Countess .
Oh , Osmond , there 's a mandate writ in heav ` n , That bids me brave all dangers for a father !
I do command thee hence !


Osmond .
Unwillingly I must obey .
- Our last , most faithful band , Attend me on the walls - and yet - Uberto , Speed to their chief !
Declare the Countess ' will , Back'd by my pow ` r  and urge their quickest aid To save their Lord !
- I follow in due season .


Countess [ to Uberto ] .
Fly , I conjure thee !


Uberto .
This way brings us nearest !
[ Exit with the Messenger - Osmond , unobserved , retires another way through the chapel . ]


Countess [ looking after them ] .
Faithful and active !
See - alive to danger , Their fellows haste to greet them .
Valiant friends !
Chieftains draw brighter swords  but yours are temper'd By heav 'n' s own spirits - truth and loyalty !
Oh , that your steps were wing'd !
- At length they 're gone , And my sick heart may live again to hope !
Methinks the renovating balm already Warms and expands its pow ` rs !
Essence of life !
Too fine and volatile to be retained !
Spent , while inhaled  and yet so sweetly poignant , That sense revives upon it !
[ Turning , she encounters Albert . ]
Heaven and earth !
Lord Albert here .


Albert .
Trust me , a sword like Albert 's Had never left the cause till fate had fix'd it !


Countess [ faintly ] .
All 's lost - all 's gone !
- My father - Sigismond !


Albert .
I dare not answer .
- Thro ' the postern gate A path yet opens to us free from foes  Lost in the spoil and plunder of the castle , They will not heed our flight .
- Nay shrink not thus  There is no other hope .


Countess .
Oh then there 's none !


Albert .
Nay , trust me , but there is  and safety too .
My train already hath prepar'd the means May convoy us -


Countess .
Oh misery !


Albert .
Hark - the spoilers Ev'n now perchance approach !
- Say , darest thou brave them ?
Shall this fair form , the prey of ruffian pow ` r , Grace the lewd haram ?
'T is no time for parley !
Thus with a tender violence -


Countess .
Stand off !
There 's blood upon thee !


Albert .
Blood !


Countess .
Aye , guiltless blood !
Bethink you , Sir - 't is holy ground we tread on !
And the dread hand of heav'n ev'n now , perhaps , Is stretch'd in vengeance o'er us !
Slept you well ?
Did no ill dreams molest - no thunders shake you ?
Methinks the warring elements last night Might from their graves have rous'd the sheeted dead , And bade them haunt the guilty !
- You are pale !
Oh , the dire vigils of a wounded conscience !
I shrink even at the thought o n't !


Albert .
Lovely trembler !
Excess of terror hath o'erwhelm'd thy reason .
Recall thy scatter'd powers !
Think that thy husband , Spared from the rage of war , still lives to guard thee .
Ev'n thus , all helpless , hopeless as thou stand ` st , The native rose thus blanch'd upon thy cheek , And those bright orbs obscured with filial anguish , Think there 's a heart that bats but to protect thee  That fondly swears -


Countess .
And innocently too !
Oh , Albert , search thy memory !
Bid it trace The black mysterious records of the past .
Question thy heart , if in yon tomb 's cold bosom No form lies hid to whom those vows were due : No ear lies closed to which that voice was music  Then shrink into thyself , as I shrink from thee , With nameless horror - and determined will .


Albert .
Living , at least , thou vainly wouldst appall me !
Nor , though the grave again should render up Its grizzly phantoms - tho ' the first-cleft skies Bid the blue meteors blaze again around , And make a hell of earth - shall my firm soul Shrink from her aim .
I 'm feared to recollection !
I would have sooth'd thy pride - have woo'd thy passions , And with a baby tale of love and war , Have won thee to my purpose - That once foil'd , Thus I enforce obedience !


Countess .
Help , Oh help there !


Albert .
Thy cries are in vain - No hostile band attends To bar my will .
- Their credulous valor finds Ample employ !
I were indeed an ideot Idly to stake upon a rapier 's point , A woman 's courtesy , or greybeard 's will , That prize for which my daring soul has plunged Ev'n to the depth of horrors .
- Come - be kind , Think of a court !


Countess [ pointing to the tomb ] .
A grave !


Albert .
Of love !


Countess .
Of murder !
Oh , monstrous sex !
Have you not smiles to kill with ?
Words that can stab ?
Deceitful sighs can wither ?
But blood must crown the mischief !
- Hence for ever !
Fly as thou may ` st !
for me , tho ' thou couldst offer Unnumber'd worlds , and every world a paradise , I would not share them with thee !


Albert .
Sayst thou so ?
Nay then 't is past thy choice .
Assist me , slaves !
[ to his attendants , who seize her . ]


Osmond [ interposing ] .
Nay , good my Lord -


Albert .
Insolent vassal , hence !


Osmond .
Bethink you , Sir - Nay this then to thy heart !
[ As Albert attempts to cut him down with his sabre , he draws a dagger and stabs him . ]
One faithful guard may do the work of thousands .
[ She faints . ]


Albert [ staggering ] .
It was well aimed - and bloodily enforces Thy most pernicious precept .
- Bind him fast !
[ to his attendants , who seize Osmond . ]
I have strength yet !
[ Shout and drums at a distance . ]
Victory - Victory !


Albert .
It withers at that sound !
And all the vital pow ` rs , of late so firm , Seem snapt at once !
[ He falls . ]
Life - fleeting - treacherous life , Ebb ` st thou so quickly !
What remains ?
Oh thou Who first hast plung'd into the world of spirits , And tried the dark unknown - do thou expound it !
Tho ' shrouded , rise !
Ere from my burning blood The strange mysterious consciousness exhale , That makes me dust or - Fiends , stand off - [ to Rudolphus , who enters hastily , and with other attendants offers to raise him . ]
I live yet - Damnation 's for hereafter !
Hark the foe !
[ Trumpet . ]
Oh , how the sprightly note invigorates nature !
This tent is cold - My cloak there !
- To the sunshine !
Cold - cold and damp - Constantia thou ` rt aveng'd !
[ He dies . ]


Distant chorus of Peasants , c. `` Triumphant see the warriors come !
`` Strike the cymbal , strike the drum .
`` Bid the festive notes agree `` To raise the song of victory .
`` Victory - Victory !
[ Shout . ]
`` Raise , raise the song of victory ! ''


[ A sprightly march , during which Turkish prisoners , and groups of soldiers enter , bearing banners . ]


Sigismond [ seeing the Countess ] .
Silence your drums - the flow ' r o ' the war is blighted , And victory 's a name !


[ The Countess recovers as the Count is led in wounded . ]


Countess .
Alas , my father !


Count Roselva .
Wounded ev'n to the death !
Lord Albert too !
Hath then the sword of war so quickly sever'd The ill ` starr'd knot ?


Osmond .
Not so , my Lord - his fate -


Count Roselva .
Thy face is prologue , Osmond , to some tale , Which my numb'd senses shrink from  tell it there .
[ pointing to the Countess . ]
My dream of life is o'er - a troublous vision .
And of its mighty host of vast affections One only lives .
- My child - Nay spare this weakness .
Something I had - Bear hence the prisoners !
I yet would live to bless thee .


Prisoner .
Who is he , That with a master voice thus dares to rule , Lord of these wide domains ?


Sigismond .
Old man , begone !


Prisoner .
Indeed !
hast thou forgot me ?
Did the Pole That tore thee from me - from thy memory Blot out my name and features ?
Thou wert mine , Ere yet thine ear had hail'd another tie !
How is 't I find thee on thy natal lands , A vassal , where thou should ` st command ?
Be proud !
And bid the minions whom thou seest around , Kneel to Roselva !


Count Roselva .
Gracious God - what say ` st thou ?


Prisoner .
I know thee not - yet sure thy aged head May call to memory the blood-stained night , When our fierce troops , like grim and angry wolves , Assailed this castle .
From the spoil I bore Its infant heir .
I was the chance of war  And the same chance restores him !
[ pointing to Sigismond .
- The Count sinks . ]


Countess .
Ha , he swoons !


Count Roselva .
Th ` avenging arm is o'er me !
Oh my daughter , I feel a strange and anxious flutt ` ring here , That bids me trust his words - thou know ` st the tale .
Be generous [ to Sigismond ] .
- Be just [ to the Countess ] - And may the pow ` rs Seal with my blood a long and blessed union , Firm as your virtues - tender as your love !
[ Joins their hands . ]
Mysterious providence !
ev'n on the spot , Where sweetly sleeps the victim of my crimes , Thy justice wakes to fearful retribution !
Oh , for a sleep like hers !
Life fades apace !
No tears - no signs [ to them ] Young , lovely , innocent  May parting nature find no crime to expiate !
But bear you pure to heav ` n !
Mine was the guilt  And be it buried with me !
- One short pray ` r !
[ He appears to pray inwardly  then sinks into their arms , and expires . ]


Semi-Chorus of Peasants and Soldiers .
`` The banner drop - invert the spear , `` Grace the fallen warrior 's bier  `` His palm is gain'd - His race is run : `` Lo , victory and death are one !
[ Full chorus . ]
`` Yet raise the song to victory ! ''


[ They group their banners , and incline them over the body of the Count as the curtain falls . ]


THE END .
