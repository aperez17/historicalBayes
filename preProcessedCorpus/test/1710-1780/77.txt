THE PROPRIETOR 'S PREFACE .


I AM sitting down to write a book for the use of all those projectors who build towns upon poetical principles .
No man is better qualified , as far as experience goes , to set this matter in a properer light than myself , because I have wasted more brick , mortar , and money , than any other individual in Europe .
Let him who hath seen , judge  and let him  point out proprieties to others who hath bitterly felt his own folly .
It is on this principle that I shall circumstantially relate certain pleasantries which cost me many years of my time , and many thousand pounds of my money .


Not that this work will be generally useful  for , luckily , more of my readers erect houses for themselves than for others  and there is no danger of its ever becoming a fashion to ruin oneself by a good intention .
Benevolence is in these days a tolerable oeconomist - as prudent a lady as could be well desired in a family - and we have nothing to fear from the influence of excessive virtues .
The nation will never be destroyed that way .


 Praise , therefore , to the discreet qualities of the age , my warning will be only for a few , and those chiefly a set of simpletons who work up their hearts to a warmth that mounts into the brain , and brings on the convulsions of sympathy .
Such hath been my disorder .


It is to you , ye gentle beings , whose bosoms are fraught with foreign woes  whose weeping eyes and milky tempers render you the slaves rather than the friends of virtue : to you I address the sentiments and the adventures of a man who was arrogant enough to suppose he could make human creatures live FOR rather than UPON one another .


Yes , I am the man who hath attempted this .
The success or miscarriage  of that attempt must be your lesson .
As to the rest of the world , I desire heartily it may have its laugh .


I shall have no objection to such ridicule .
The labourer is worthy of his hire .

A GOOD-NATURED PAGE OR TWO , WHICH MAY PERHAPS MEND THE READER 'S TEMPER .


 ABOUT six years ago I had retired into one of the most romantick parts of Cumberland , and was one day so tenderly inclined - men have their fits of benevolence - that every thing within contact was the better for me .
It happened to be a day too , wherein many opportunities of being gracious presented themselves .
Destiny seemed to take advantage of it by a care to supply me with objects .
It is worth your while to mark how my feelings were exercised .
The old cat brought into the world nine young  and I saw  eight of them basketted for death .
Savage , cried I , to the servant , carry back the poor things to their mother !
and instead of straw let them be wrapped up in cotton .
Scarce was this reprieve given to the offspring of one party , before that of another rose to view .
I was one of his majesty 's justices , and , it seems , the peace , which it was my office to guard , had been broken by a wench who had been so improvident to follow the impulses of nature before they were sanctified by law .
Wretch , ( said the constable who was dragging her before me ) how dare you bring your burthens on this parish ?
Wretch , ( said I to the constable ) what is that to thee ?
So I gently chid the mother , and kissed the child , for she had concealed herself  till that time , and was taken in the wicked act of giving it suck .
This fired the feelings of the constable and softened mine .
Let a chamber and a cradle be provided for this child , and give something comfortable to the mother , and pray carry some new milk to the cat with nine kittens : Shall I save a cat , and have no charity for a fellow-creature ?
These strokes so smoothed me , and prepared for future events , that I was almost afraid to breathe out my joy , lest with that breath I should destroy the animalcula which naturalists say are thereby murthered .
I set my foot on the ground with caution , lest I should crush some honest insect that might be as well disposed as myself .
My very legs ached when I perceived I was within an hair 's  breadth of extirminating an ant who was laden with food , which I could not but fancy was designed to a sick friend in the neighbouring hillock .
As I pursued my walk along my garden , wishing the universe a thousand good lucks , I cast my eye aslant a quick-set , and saw a Linnet extending the maternal wing over her nest .
Looking behind me , I beheld the gardener whetting his sheers .
Hark ye friend , said I , in that hedge there is a family which I take upon me to protect , and therefore so far from your clipping off a twig - But , sir , it spoils the look of the whole garden , interrupted the gardener .
I was so shocked at the fellow 's inhumanity , that my hand had , insensibly , got into my pocket to feel for the price of his discharge .
Not  choosing to be whimsical , I thought it best to go another way to work .
I put half a crown into his hand , and told him I preferred the luxuriant branches of the natural hedge to the smuggest alteration he and his sheers could possibly make .
This did not quite satisfy him .
The man had got a habit of spoiling Nature , and loved lopping away a beauty in his soul .
My Linnet seemed to suspect him .
She had shifted about in her nest so as to command his whole person .
I trembled for her .
How is thy wife to-day , John ?
said I .
As well as can be expected , sir , replied he , for a woman who looks to be brought to bed every hour  she has the head-ach too , and I am obliged to take off my shoes to go into her chamber .
John , said I , you  are a very honest fellow - give me your hand - let us walk and speak softly : there is a worthy female in your wife 's situation , now in that hedge .


Is there , sir ?
- answered the gardener in a whisper , and collecting into his face all the lines of caution - hush - hush - hush -


He beckoned me exactly as he would have done had I rashly opened the door of his wife 's chamber .
The sensation was brought home .


There is no call for sheers at present , sir , said he , and the less we walk that way the better - hush - hush - hush .
-


He now repeated his signal to keep silence , and went off on tip-toe till he gained the greensward .


 Thus was my humour still more sweetened  I was so happy that I looked up to the sun , which shone on me , with emulation  with rivalry .


A little rhapsody escaped me - and , were it possible , my beam should be like thine .
There is not a single object which some ray or other of my benevolence should not animate .


Taking my eyes from the heavens , and casting them to earth , I saw a cluster of Pinks drooping for want of a support .
Warmed as I then was , 't is inconceivable with how much pleasure I placed them about a stick and tied them gently round it .
As they stood erect in their new attitude there came from them an odour that seemed to thank me .
It may be the  fragrance of gratitude !
Imagination chose to think it such .
What amiable deception !


But I had just turned from the flowers when an insect which settled upon my left cheek stung me so sensibly that I raised up my arm , and spread my hand to flap it into annihilation .
Bodily pain is a trying point .
I took out a pocket glass ( which I happened to have about me ) and viewed my enemy .
The motion had alarmed him , and his tongue was taken out of my cheek .
There are strange traits in my character .
I represented him as having just risen from banquetting to his heart 's content .
The orifice he had made was not bigger than a small pin 's head .
The appearance  was at worst that of a pimple - the pain was gone .
It is but the harvest bump of an happy insect , said I. - It was too fine a day methought to banish any thing animate from the light , and I was in too good a temper to be vindictive .
-


Get thee gone , fool , said I - shakeing my head .
Much good may it do thee .
It buzzed thanks , and flew away .


At this crisis my daughter came running to tell me her Canary had recovered , and she had just saved her brood of Chicks from the Kite .


Better and better still , Matilda , said I , let us go into the house .
The heart was stirred .

OF THE LATE WM. SHENSTONE , ESQ. .


 TO exercise the soul in benevolent trifles is a good way to prepare it for matters of more consequence .
After these transactions , I and my daughter Matilda were sittting at the door of an airy hall that commanded one of the finest lawns in my garden .
What an evening !
said Matilda  is there any thing in nature , papa , so fine as a setting sun !
Yes , said I in an extacy , starting at the same time from my seat , a rising one .
Matilda agreed to the remark , but seemed surprised at the emotion .
She did not know there was more `` meant than met the ear . ''
While ideas were operating  into fit language there was a profound silence : and during this interval on our parts , the birds began to carol forth their evening songs , and all the notes of a summer sun-setting-time poured upon the ear .
In this voluptuous sensation we remained , till Matilda ran to the library and brought a book , telling me , that reading was the only thing wanting to perfect our felicity .
Then read , my dear , said I : read .


I have brought one of those books , papa , ( continued Matilda ) which was written by your friend Mr. Shenstone .
Look ye , it is the second volume .


You could not have laid your fair hand on any thing so apropos .
Shenstone is , of all other moderns , the  author to finish a fine evening after having passed the former part of the day in gentle deeds .


Where then shall I read ?


You can not open him amiss .


Ah !
generous enthusiasm , how wert thou befriended in this moment !
The first sentiment which Matilda recited was the following .
The soul of Shenstone shone through every syllable .


' I feel an avarice of social pleasure , which produces only mortification : I never see a town or city in a map , but I figure to myself many agreeable persons in it , with whom I could wish to be acquainted . '
What a thought !
said I  I could have found it in my heart to have  sallied out in search of new and valuable acquaintance !
The kind nerves began to thrill .


The next sentiment which my daughter pitched upon carried the matter still farther .


` What Miriads wish to be as blest as I ! '
The idea of all the large property I possessed came across me , and I could not help saying - what Miriads then could I bless !
The warmth of the blood increased .


The third passage cost me forty thousand pounds .


` Had I a fortune of eight or ten thousand pounds a year , I would , methinks , make myself a neighbourhood .
I would first build a village  with a church , and people it with inhabitants of some branch of trade that was suitable to the country round .
I would then , at proper distances , erect a number of genteel boxes , of about a thousand pounds apiece , and amuse myself with giving them all the advantages they could receive from taste .
These would I people with a select number of well-chosen friends , assigning to each annually the sum of two hundred pounds for life .
The salary should be irrevocable in order to give them independency .
The house , of a more precarious tenure that , in cases of ingratitude , I might introduce another inhabitant . '
At the close of this sentence which , by the bye , did not finish the passage ,  Matilda kissed the printed page and said a thousand civil things of the author .
It was impossible to go any further .
My whole soul was at work .
Dost thou not begin to smile reader ?


Ah !
Matilda , had I permitted thee to read the other period , thou mightest have been at least forty thousand pounds richer .


We shall close Mr. Shenstone 's book and this chapter together .
It shows a good deal .

WHICH PROVES THE AUTHOR 'S DAUGHTER TO BE A STRANGE GIRL .


 THE gentle Matilda took me by the arm , and we had another turn in the garden .
The last lingering efforts of light were glimmering .
It was the still hour , when benevolent schemes are best projected .
Sitting down on a painted bench , we entered into conversation .
Daughter , said I , were it not for thee , I feel myself this moment full of a plan that I should certainly put in practise .
The plans , which my papa forms , must be all generous , and I am , therefore , concerned to hear that I stand in the way  betwixt him and a generous action .
Matilda , you are naturally intitled to my fortune .
It is a bachelor only who can be rich enough to be whimsical .
There is a powerful check on a father .
He is accountable to his child for every guinea  so that though I am full ( as I said before ) of a scheme which might perhaps build up the happiness of many families , I can not persuade myself to do it on the ruins of thy inheritance .
No , I would rather seem just than romantick .


Pray , sir , how rich may you be ?


I have ten thousand a-year and some ready money , Matilda .


Had I that sum , I should lay out nine of them , annually , in the cause  of various humanity , and live like a queen upon my tenths .


Indeed !


And does my papa suppose I could be guilty of employing more than a thousand pounds a-year upon myself ?
( I told thee , reader , she was a strange girl . )


Oh !
there are many who employ that sum on their individual selves in a month , my dear .


Perhaps so : but it is a science too difficult for your Matilda  so pray pursue your project , sir .


Will it not clip the wing of your future liberality should mine be now exerted to the usage of the greatest part of my fortune ?
Consider Matilda .


 Can a great example - can learning me how to fly to the noblest heights clip the wings of liberality ?
No , sir , it will rather expand them  the sooner generous actions are done the better  and the sooner you learn me the art of doing them in the most effectual manner , the more reason shall I have to thank you .
Pray , papa , do your duty by me .


How much , Matilda , would you give to see a large groupe of your fellow-creatures perfectly independent ?
To have all their tears dried up , and to make them uninterruptedly happy ?
Suppose , I say , such a point rested with you , at what rate would you purchase it ?
Be ingenuous .


Let me see - you have , you say ten thousand pounds a-year : why  then I would give precisely nine thousand five hundred  and if one very hard place yet remained which another hundred could smooth , I would not stand out for that too .
The rest I would keep in my own hands , because I have a right to independence as much as another .
( Didst ever hear such a Simpleton , reader ! )


And this you would actually and chearfully do upon your honour ?


Chearfully and actually upon my honour .


Then my dear let us go into the house , and see what steps are necessary to realize the benevolent project of friend SHENSTONE .


What a delicious idea , said Matilda , with tears in her eyes : blessed  be the memory of the charming poet for suggesting the thought , and blessed the spirit of my father which carries it into execution .


We talked over the matter for two hours , and then parted for the night .
To which fool , reader , dost thou give preference  the father , or the child ?

AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROPRIETOR 'S STEWARD .


 REPOSE was banished from the pillow .
She was chased away as an unwelcome guest .
Fancy and all her fairy train were admitted in her stead .
I could not help anticipating my joys  and upon meeting Matilda at breakfast , I found we had passed the night in the same way .
It was presently resolved to seek out a convenient spot upon which my village was to be built .
This , Matilda said , must be such a retreat as naturally gave scope for all the flourishes of art and nature .
I enjoyed the gravity  with which she advised me , in my choice of ground , to take care it commanded verdant walks , and winding vallies , hills regularly climbing one beyond another , with plenty of shade for love and for poetry , forests of the thickest gloom for philosophers , and water for cascades and for convenience .
You can not , papa , said she , be too cautious in this particular , for if your village is not well situated , and highly embellished , it will be impossible to make any thing of it .


But although one might allow this embroidery to the gaiety of a girl like Matilda , I did not think it decent so to tassel and fringe my own ideas  being indeed more solicitous about finding a wholesome spot , than one merely poetical and picturesque .


 Yet notwithstanding my ardour , I soon perceived there would be more heads than one necessary to be summoned .
The labour of my scheme multiplied as I thought on it  and the more I weighed it , the more caution and consultation became necessary .
What would I not have given for the assistance of half a dozen heads as well turned to the airy mechanicks of building castles as myself .
But I was too well read in the modern history of the heart to suppose my plan would meet general approbation .
How did I wish that friend Shenstone himself was yet alive , that I might repair to Hales-Owen , and turn his paradise of the Leasowes into a village garden .
How conformable , said I , would this be to the philanthropic turn of his mind !
 What a pleasing compliment to raise up a neighbourhood in the way he himself chalked out !


Meditating on these points , it was long before I could select , from the circle of my friends , any persons whom I conceived proper to speak to on the subject .
Matilda had all the favourable dispositions in the world to expend money upon plausible projects  but her imagination was too florid , and her years too tender , to assist me in the actual execution .


It was at the time that I was thus undetermined whom to choose for a confident , that a man who had been twenty eight years the family steward , and whose locks were grown silver in honest servitude , made his appearance  before me .
He was an arch , experienced fellow , possessed much of that which receives half its merit from a quaint manner and delivery , and had so competent a skill in general subjects , that he obtained in my parish the nick-name of The Oracle .


Some of his qualities would , I own , have deterred me from disclosing the circumstance to him , had not others encouraged me .
These encouragements were principally the goodness of his heart , and the queerness of his humour  the first of which induced him to a thousand worthy actions , and the second rendered him a most companionable creature .
He was starch , stay'd , generous , waggish , original , and odd .


 But the business which he now came about was favourable to that greater one which rolled in my mind .
He came to inform me , that as the warm weather was now set in , my sheep might be SAFELY washed and sheered .
There is no danger now , sir , said he , of the poor fools catching cold  for , in troth , it always gives me the stomach-ach whenever I see them ducked head over heels , and then sent , without their warm coats , to shake and shiver in the shade .
But now , sir , now the closer you clip , the cooler .
Whet the sheers , sir  whet the sheers .


This looked to me like the exact moment of communication , and I bid Mr. Samuel Sarcasm shut the door and come nearer .
I took his wrist .


 Honest Samuel , said I , you have been very long an ornament to my family , and I hope you and your 's will continue in it to the latest posterity .
You must know I have present occasion for your assistance .
I have thoughts of improving my estate , particularly that part which lieth in Wales .


If , indeed , you could bring that to bear , sir , said Samuel , you would do something  for there is about ten acres of heath on the left side of your plantations and nurseries that disgust me horridly : that part of the earth seems to be lazy , sir , and answereth not the ends of its creation  and ten acres of waste is atrocious  quite atrocious .


 Very true : what is to be done , Samuel ?


Why , sir , as it is gone too far for the plough , and , I believe , would not grow much grain , I do not know but it might answer well enough for some other purpose .
Your tenant , Turnland , who occupies the Leas beyond it , tells me , there are such a scarcity of houses in that part of Wales , that a man of property might venture to build a little .


To build , Samuel ?
- Pray go on - your discourse charms me .


I am moreover instructed , sir , that many huts thereabouts are dropping into decay , and that the Welch landlords are , in general , too poor to re-build .
Suppose , therefore , that you  were to run up a few neat cottages and small farm-houses in this very spot that I speak of  depend on it they would lett well , and thus we might make the ground grateful to the proprietor perforce .


Very true , upon my soul , Samuel , cried I in great rapture , and we will call it SHENSTONE-GREEN .


Call it what you will , sir , replied Samuel , but were I you , I would insist on making every foot of land that I had in the world do its duty .
To let ground lie idle , because it is naturally indolent , is , as I take it , criminal , sir .
No man should presume to say a thing is barren till he sees it is impossible to make it bring forth .


 A noble argument , Samuel , and I can improve it .
Fetch Shenstone , Matilda : Shenstone , Volume the second .


While Matilda was gone into the library , the good steward sat himself coolly down , and began his calculation .
But scarce had he demonstrated twice eight to be sixteen , before Matilda came skipping in with Shenstone .


Read , man ( said I to Samuel , giving him the book , and pointing to the passage ) .
No sooner had he read it , than he laid down the book upon a table , and said with a fignificant smile - it is fine talking .


Well , Samuel , what do you think of it ?


I said , sir , it is fine talking .


 But suppose one was to act in that manner ?
Would it not be pleasing ?
Would it not be carrying the human almost into the divine nature ?


It would indeed , sir  it would be doing as one should never be done by  and so far it would be exceeding the commands of holy writ , which only ordereth us to do unto others as we wish they would do unto us  and to wish any man to throw away his money and time in that manner would be atrocious  quite atrocious .


Samuel , Samuel , I am resolved upon my scheme , and so do not attempt to sneer me out of it .
I will act according to that advice you have just read , and I will have a town of my own for purposes therein mentioned ,  without delay .
A town I will build , and the name of it shall be SHENSTONE-GREEN .


Then , sir , it would be atrocious in me to gainsay it  so if you will please to intrust the book to me , I will calculate how much you can do with your income in conformity to the gentleman 's fancy .
But , under favour , sir , who might be the projector of this romance ?


I now showed Samuel the titlepage , which stands thus : ` The Works , in Prose and Verse , of WILLIAM SHENSTONE , Esq. with Decorations . '


Decorations indeed , said Samuel , putting the book into his pocket   thy head was well decorated , Mr. Poet , I warrant it .
- Then turning to me - I marvel , sir , this passage should be in prose , for I will be so bold to say it has all the properties of poetry , and might very well figure in a fairy tale  but , sir , it is your affair and not mine , and it would be therefore atrocious for me to say more .


To-morrow , sir , added he , I will tell you within an hundred of bricks what may be done .


In so doing , Samuel , you will oblige me , and in the mean time assure yourself that , with the assistance of a deputy , thou shalt be steward of Shenstone-Green .


It sufficeth , replied Samuel , and so went away .

THE PROJECT ADVANCES .
IN THIS SHORT CHAPTER THE PROPRIETOR CARRIES THE READER FROM ENGLAND TO WALES .


 PERFECTLY soothed and satisfied with myself and with my project , I coloured the new Arcadia , which I was about to raise around me , in the most attracting manner .
The golden age , said I , shall presently be realized .
I could almost have shed tears of joy at finding myself able to carry on my scheme as it seemed to deserve , namely , upon the broadest scale of general benevolence .


 In the triumph of these prospects , the steward again advanced with the paper of calculation in his hand .
The generous enthusiasm had , by this time , got so close to my heart , that I could scarce bear his method of measuring every thing that was to be done in the matter by the rule of mathematical certainty .
Friend , Samuel , ( said I to him , as he deliberately advanced towards me ) we must not be over exact in this affair .
We must , as it were , indulge our tempers in a sort of poetical licence - a few thousand pounds , one way or other , should make no difference in the great cause of communicating joy .
What though I shall attempt what was never attempted before ?
This will rather  urge me to go on than to desist .
If therefore you stand too strictly upon the minutiae , it will distress and not serve me  for I have a few odd thousands at my banker 's which may serve to make up deficiencies , in case of an exigence .


Ah !
would to God , said Matilda , the village were set fairly about !
Shenstone-Green !
What a sweet name !


The account stands thus , said the steward with infinite phlegm , offering a paper : ` SAMUEL SARCASM 'S Calculation for the building , peopling , and repairing a village on a New Construction - in order TO GIVE AWAY . '


 The sordid title to his account ran so little to my mind , that I threw down the paper , and resolved to read no further .
The very idea of such oeconomy shocked .


What said I , unfeeling Samuel , would you think of your master , if he was to lavish his whole fortune in the vices of ages .


I should think , sir , that he was a very bad man .


But , since he resolves to improve it in the mannet insinuated , what opinion dost thou form of him in that case ?


That he is better , sir , than it is necessary .


 Pshaw , said Matilda , I have no patience with such old follows .
Their feelings are absorbed in the rules of multiplication .
In the name of Shenstone set all hands to work , papa , and follow the dictates of your own heart in spite of all the stewards in Christendom .
I should die if you were not to finish Shenstone-Green .


Enough said , replied the steward  I see you have made up your mind , sir , and I shall only say further , that the job shall oe done as cheap as possible .
I accept the stewardship because I think I can save at least enough out of the mere brick and mortar business , ( for masonry is atrocious ) to set up half a dozen of your traders .
It is sinful , sir , to waste the tenth part of a tile .


 Spoke like a saint , Samuel , said I  then no more talking , but to work .
We will set out for Wales to-morrow  and , when we are arrived there , the affair shall be finished out of hand .


The sooner , sir , it is finished , said Samuel Sarcasm , the better for you .


Then order the necessary preparations without delay , answered I , speaking quick .


They shall be ordered , said Samuel , speaking slow .

THE PROPRIETOR BUYS A BOOK .


 THE soul and all its affections were in so glowing , and , if I may so say , so glorious a heat during these preparatory circumstances , that there was no time to feel the force of buts , ifs , whys , wherefores , or any other stops , which , in a colder moment might bar up a man 's passage .
Passion victoriously leaped over all , and disdained to wait for the dampning effects of a prudential or political maxim .
It was in vain , therefore , that the steward obliquely threw in my way any hints to detain me any longer in Cumberland .
I sat up  all night to arrange my affairs there to my inclination .
I took care that my absence should neither be lamented by the poor nor the rich .
I put every thing in a fair train of going on smoothly , and actually set out , with my steward , for my estate in Wales at dawning of the day .
Matilda remained in Cumberland with her cousin , who had been many years a part of my family , and who was one of those men in whom curiosity of every kind , but that which related to dog , gun , and game , was absolutely dead .
Happy vagabond !
How was he to be envied !


It would have been insupportable to toil through so long a journey , had not imagination alleviated the length of the road  but , with her assistance ,  the mile-stones were measured , and passed , without anxiety .
Though there was , in reality , nothing on the side of me but the arch muscles of the steward , ( who grinned a silent sarcasm on my scheme in every lineament of his face ) yet I pictured all that is beautiful and bewitching .
I stopped at a large market-town to change horses , and was struck with the title of a work which hung at a bookseller 's window .
Buy that book for me , said I , Samuel .
He did so  and we proceeded in our journey .

THE BOOK IS EXAMINED .


 THIS volume was the `` Description of Millenium-Hall , and the country adjacent , together with the characters of the inhabitants , c. '' - If my fancy was before heated , it was , upon the reading this performance , fairly in flames : Not that I approved all the regulations of the Millenium Society , or thought the system of benevolence by any means satisfactory , but because I was , just at that time , in the humour to catch avidly at every thing that gave an opportunity to praise my own project , and oppose the significant looks of Samuel , The Oracle .


 But that obstinate mortal was proof against all artillery , and did not seem a whit persuaded by the most florid `` Description of Millenium-Hall . ''
Had the fellow 's face been cut in marble , it could not have been more pertinaciously fixed  and when I came to that part of the performance where the enchanting society assembled together in a spacious hall , to pursue each a favourite and elegant amusement , he twisted up his rusty fibres into a kind of ludicrous contraction , ( mixing , as it were , smiles and frowns ) and said , if I would give him leave , he would offer his humble opinion upon as much of the book as had been yet read .
But Mr. Samuel 's  harangue being a precious relict , it deserves to stand alone in a separate chapter .
It is a most atrocious morsel indeed .

A PANEGYRIC ON WOMEN AND BOOKS .


 THE Oracle began with these words : I commence with observing , sir , that books are atrocious .
They are , in general , so much above or below life , that either way one can expect no truth .
Common-sense is thought too dull , and all other sense is so useless , that , I should be glad to know , what can keep the presses in employment ?
Why , sir , nothing but fancy , and folly , and fine sense , which , I assert once more , is no sense at all .
This being my notion of books in general , you will judge  what it is of romances in particular .
Romances , sir , I define to be of all atrocious things the most atrocious , because they describe matters that never were , and , I hope to heaven , never will be .
This being the case , it follows that very few books ought to be either printed or read  and of all books I set down that same Millenium-Hall as containing the greatest share of things impossible .


Here I frowned .


Frown as you will , sir , it behoves me to say ( since my opinion is asked ) I can prove that romance to be impracticable in its first setting out .
Why , sir , the first principle is atrocious .
Do you think that Miss Mansell , and Miss Morgan , Lady M. Jones , Mrs. Selvyn , Mrs. Trentham , and all the  other Lady Bountifuls , could live together in the same house without lovers , husbands , or quarrels ?
Sir , sir , sir , you must be exceedingly atrocious in the knowledge of women not to know that this is altogether out of nature .


I bit my lips .


That may be , sir , ( replied Samuel , sticking to his point ) but I am sure mistakes would every day , not to say , every hour , happen , to set this Attic School , as you call it , in an uproar .
I remember very well the pretty postures in which they are described sitting in the book  but bring them out of that book into real life , and I would engage for an alteration .
If you , sir , knew the sex when shut up  together under the same roof , you would be surprised at the impudence of a fellow who would tell you of their living in harmony for such a number of years .
No , no  times and seasons would come about , if you were with them , when Mrs. Maynard would throw her orrery at Mrs. Selvyn , who , like a true woman , would throw her book at Mrs. Maynard , Mrs. Mansell , notwithstanding her being the finest form , and albeit , had beautiful brown hair , would toss her Madona at Mrs. Trentham 's carved figure , and away , I warrant you , would go that same carved work to knock off the beautiful brown-haired Mrs. Mansell 's Madona .


Prithee , dear sir , if you mean that your new town should last till the  bricks are cemented , do not put half a dozen ladies of spirit in any part of it together .
He paused , and then went on .


They may do very well , sir , in a romance , ( like your Millenium-Hall ) but to introduce them upon Shenstone-Green would put all Wales in confusion .
No , no , we will build better than that too .
Our village shall be of another guess construction .
- No Maynards and Mansells .


This last remark re-instated the sagacious Mr. Samuel in perfect favour .
It looked like giving a little into my project , and through that acquiescence were my affections now to be taken .


I arrived , in due season , at my estate , and received the homage of  my Welch tenants .
It was the business of the next morning to inspect the waste-ground alluded to , and we found it the very best spot in the world for Shenstone-Green .


Of this you will the better judge when you read the letter I sent my daughter .


To MATILDA BEAUCHAMP , in CUMBERLAND .


I AM just come , my dear , from taking a survey of the ground that is to be fixed on for Shenstone-Green .
It exactly suits us .
At the back are the finest nurseries of woods in Wales  it stands on an eminence  it is almost an oval , and the green which struggles through the thistles is a sort of velvet-most .
No carpet  was ever softer .
Springs of living water come issuing from the adjacent mountains , and there is an abundance of game in the vallies .
Add to which , it is on my private estate , so that houses and lands will be essentially created out of my own property .
Samuel is writing for builders , and we shall have both men and money without loss of time .
You shall come soon .
Mean while ,


I am , Your most affectionate father , BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP .


It is almost incredible to conceive how soon Samuel collected hands .
The sons of the trowel poured in on  every side from every quarter  and , though Wales is not very favourable to materials for village-building , I soon saw that money would enable me to make a city instead of a country town .

THE EFFUSIONS OF ENTHUSIASM .


 I Remember nothing ever pleased me so thoroughly as the figure , physiognomy , and behaviour of the person who came down ( in his own carriage ) to me in the capacity of schemer .
There was a great deal of architecture in all his features .
He looked too , as if he could build up and pull down exactly in a manner the most pleasing to his employers .
Certainly never was proprietor better suited with a projector .


He no sooner examined the ground than he protested it was capable of every thing .
For the sake of society  he advised the form of the village to be circular , and so , making a ring , he gave directions to fix the line for twenty-five boxes equidistant , leaving space for garden before and behind .
The traders cottages were to lie at some little distance in a separate quarter .
In the centre was to be a pedestal and statue erected to the memory of Shenstone  there was to be a parish church  and the houses were to be accurately alike .
In short , there was to be every thing that could charm the sight or the senses on Shenstone-Green .


Such was the schemer 's dispatch , that he was ready for the rest of the artificers in a trice , and all hands went merrily to work .
No language  can express the trembling joy with which I laid myself the first stone and brick for the building of Shenstone-Green .
In the very instant it was doing , I considered myself as about to raise a Temple to Generosity .
The quantity of beef and beer given away on this occasion might have deluged the honesty of five hundred freeholders at an English election .
The artificers told me that unless the ground was well watered , or , to speak more properly , well beered , no future crops of felicity were to be expected .
To prevent , therefore , all misfortunes of this nature , carpenters , masons , and even the schemer himself got so thoroughly intoxicated for the future honour and prosperity of Shenstone-Green , that until three days after the  debauch , not a finger could wag in the way of its profession .


In due time , however , the hour of sobriety returned , and I had the pleasure to see every body in earnest .
Help me to describe the bliss , ye children of Hope and Imagination - ye who have built your castles in the clouds - help to say , how I rejoiced at the prospect of so much generous labour !
More than fifty times a-day did I walk round and round the space allotted for the village , stopping a-while at every ten yards to indulge the effusions of my enthusiasm .
Here , perhaps , said I , in this spot , may , by and by , reside one of my best friends , now pining in poverty .
On this barren heath , which hath hitherto resounded  only with the noise of goats , shall echo the happy conversation of human beings .
Flowers shall usurp the place now occupied by brambles , and even religion shall move , with sainted steps , over MY GREEN .


Though it was difficult to pass over the bricks , the lime , and the mortar , I congratulated myself very heartily on such little embarrassments .
This confusion , said I , touching my steward on the shoulder - this confusion , Samuel , arises not from the desolation of conquest .
The heaps of rubbish which impede our passage here , are not created by the ruins of some fair city , which hath fallen the victim of a military fury , who magnifies  murther into patriotism .
- No , Mr. Steward  every brick that you now behold shall be presently converted to the purposes of benevolence .
Those waggons are laden with the materials of future happiness .
Love and friendship shall flourish in the little temples that are raised from thence  and I look therefore with a kind of veneration on the very horses that are thus engaged in the service of Shenstone-Green .
Though a little frenzy , reader , might then touch me , was I not to be envied ?


The horses , sir , said Samuel , are very much obliged to you  so , if you please , we will withdraw to the mansion-house , where I have something to show your Honour .


 With all my heart , honest Samuel , said I  with all my heart .
A child might have led me at discretion .

A PROJECT DESTROYED BY A LAUGH .


 THE mansion-house to which we were then retiring , stood about a mile to the right of the future Shenstone-Green .
It was there that I lodged my workmen , ( the house being extremely commodious ) till their labours should be completed  and we had no sooner got within sight of the building , than Samuel stopped short to lean on his stick , and beg I would look about me .


Sir , said he , a thought strikes me .
Behold the venerable seat of your forefathers , none of whom ever had any notion of dipping themselves up  to the very neck in mortar as you are about to do .
Your ancestors , sir , lived in this house , which is almost a town of itself .
Now , sir , as you do not choose to live like your ancestors , but are resolved , atrociously resolved , to introduce things that were never before heard of , I presume to hope you will have no objection to go the cheapest way to work .


Certainly , Mr. Sarcasm , said I .


That being the case , sir , replied Samuel , you have now an opportunity to save a world of money .


Here he held out his stick .


That building is surely large enough sir , to fill with families that do not properly belong to you .
There is  sufficient room within that edifice to make a pretty expensive tryal of your project .


Well , and what then , Mr. Samuel Sarcasm ?
said I. I could freely have taken his stick to thrash him .


Why then , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , replied he , I would humbly advise that you turn out all the men , horses , bricks , and other materials of benevolence from Shenstone-Green , and suffer kine to browse the thistle and to nip the grass , till you see whether it answers to proceed .
It will be time enough to enlarge , sir , when this goodly mansion is filled to your mind .


I was on the edge of a reply to this proposal , when the projector  came running to acquaint me of a new improvement .
- I immediately told him of Samuel 's plan , and did not fail to mix it up with a decent degree of ridicule .


The projector burst into such an immoderate degree of laughter , that I could not help joining him , and Samuel coughed again with color .
There was more wisdom and goodness in Samuel 's cough than the projector 's laughter .

CONTAINING A CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT .


 BUT this , sir , said the steward recovering himself , this is not the business I was going to talk of .
Please to come with me into the mansion-house , and I will show you I have not been idle in pushing on the project of Shenstone-Green .
So far contrarywise , that I have been employing myself as serviceably as Mr. Projector himself  though it must be owned I am not so merry .


This put me again into good humour .
A man of my temper , and engaged in my way , is always pleased ,  if you do but flatter the parts which most deserve to be censured .
I walked into the house with the very person who had before offended me , arm in arm .


Pity the infirmity of a castle-builder , reader , and proceed .


My friend Samuel put a paper into my hand , and desired my opinion .
In the full assurance of receiving pleasure , I opened it  and read what follows :


' 12.1 .
ADVERTISEMENT I .


WANTED , as many lazy and unfortunate people as can properly fill twenty or thirty houses of three rooms on a floor .


N. B .
The houses will be on a new plan .


12.2 .
ADVERTISEMENT II .


 WHEREAS a well-disposed gentleman , aged fifty , ( and s  ound in mind ) having an only daughter ( who dispises money ) and ten thousand pounds to throw away in charitable abuses , hereby gives notice to the public , that , he is making a town for the good of mankind , with all possible dispatch  and , humbly invites every body , who have neither house or home , to hold themselves in readiness , as they may depend upon hearing further the moment things are fit for their reception .
Such miserables , therefore , as choose to be well lodged , and to enjoy an irrevocable salary of two hundred pounds  per annum for life , without paying lot or scot , will please to send in their names ( real and fictitious ) as well as places of present abode ( whether in garrets or cellars ) , that a proper quantum of soap and clean linen may be transmitted to their several apartments , prior to their appearance before the worthy gentleman who is at the whole cost of the scheme .


N. B. Broken limbs , hump backs , bandied legs , and all other infirmities , whether of flesh or bone , internal or external , will be esteemed so many additional recommendations .
It is therefore requested , that candidates will never think themselves unqualified , but repair to Shenstone-Green  on stilts , stumps , and all manner of other ingenious contrivances whatsoever .
God save the well-disposed gentleman !


' This was such a reflexion on the more noble views of my soul , that I considered the steward too abject at that time for my resentment  and , therefore , collecting together all the coolness of philosophy , even in the midst of a poetical pursuit , I told him I thought his advertisements were just what I expected from his elegant pen , and that the sooner he committed them to the press , the better .
I believe Samuel was piqued at my taking his sarcasm so tranquilly , for he turned upon his heel with an abruptness that at once denoted anger  and disappointment .
My fortitude on this occasion , however , had so good an effect , that Mr. Samuel dropped his importunities from that moment , for at least two days .

THE PROPRIETORS WEAKNESS AND SINGULARITY .


 IN the mean time the builders went briskly on , and in a few months , a very goodly show of houses began to promise the future completion of my hopes .
No sooner did the heath begin to assume the look of a town , than I surveyed it with self-congratulation .
As I never suffered my imagination to be cooled , either by the idea of expence or by the sarcastic strokes of my steward , it kindled every day into more ardour , and , I very well remember , my heart was so full when I saw the project nearly concluded , that I retired into  a shady walk , which some adjacent poplars afforded me , and burst into tears .


Ah !
what a voluptuous moment !
Ah !
what tears were these !
represent to yourself , reader , a man whose fancy was embellished with the most exalted and amiable views .


Well , said I , it is now time to look about me .
I have made a village .
How pleasing the axe , the chissel , and mallet , echo one another !
there is something generous in the sound .
Scarce had this idea passed , before I beheld one of the workmen dragging along a sledge with freestone and marble , ready polished , for the inferior parts of some of my buildings .
The big drops of labour  coursed down his forehead , and at every dozen yards he stopped a little to breathe and to gather strength .
As the next pause he made was within a few paces of me , I saw plainly his situation .
The veins of his face and neck seemed to distend with the force of pulling - the muscles of an athletic man looked to be bursting .
It is amazing to think what I felt !
- Poor fellow , said I advancing , thou art a good soul I am sure  at the same time my heart urged me to carry my handkerchief to his forehead , and to wipe away the sweat .


' `` I could have hugged the greasy rogue , He pleased me , '' reader . '
As to that , master , said the labourer , it do n't signify  I always  sweats  but if your Honour would give us a drop of the dear creature , I should like it much better than a wipe of the face with a white hankerchief .
Odds bobs , sir , we have a heavy batch of business at the Green yonder .


The dear creature shall be much at your service as soon as I can fetch it from the mansion-house  but at present a little rest will be not amiss , so sit down under these trees , and let us talk .


By chance I had , in a side-pocket , a half-pint flask of cordials , which I sometimes carried in case of accidents like the present .
Before the preceding speech , therefore , was finished , I recollected this circumstance , and produced it to view .
The change in the  man 's features at sight of the flask was remarkable enough .
Lord , sir , said he , licking his lips , what a good gentleman you are - do n't you find it nation hot , sir ?
Oh !
what a pleasant sight is one of your narrow-necked , gluck , glucking gentry , when a man is a-dry .


I gave him the bottle , which was in a moment glued to his lips  and after he had drank , he sat upon the grass , and the following conversation passed between us .


Sir , said the man , ( shaking the brick-dust from his shirt ) I have long wished for the honour of talking with you , and I am glad , through your Honour 's goodness , that I have got this opportunity .
I am poor but honest .


 Speak freely honest friend , then .


Why then , sir , about this same Shinstun-Green .
- Is it really a factotum that you are putting yourself to all this charge for other folks ?
The talk goes amongst the masons and bricklayers that you design to give away house , and land , and money , almost to any man that is poor and honest .


The report is true .


And wo n't you really think better o n't , and give them the bite , sir ?
Will your Honour go thorough stitch with this affair ?


Why should you doubt me ?


Becase , sir , I have my reasons .


Name them .


 Why here have I been mason 's man and master mason going on of twenty years , and worked in that time for gentle and simple , yet never heard of such an honourable man as your Honour in my life .
Look ye , sir , our business goes on in a regular channel .
A man comes to me and says , Master Hewit , or Henry , or Mr. Henry Hewit , I want a house built , or a wall run up , or some such matter .
Upon that I takes my bag of work-tools , and goes to the place , where I finishes my jobb for so much the piece or so much the day .
But first I tries to get as much as I can for my work , and my employer tries , on his side , to get my work as cheap as possible .
My bargain being once struck , I must abide by it  and let  the sun burn my guts out , not a nogging of drink extra would be given to save'em


Drink , friend  pray drink .


Discourse , to be sure , heats  so here 's to your extraordinary Honour 's health .
Well , sir , jobb being finished , we separate  my master pays me growlingly , and goes into the house I have built .
Now here lies the difference : you give us all our own fair price , and pay chearfully for extra , and instead of going into the house yourself , you clap in a family who shall perhaps be found skulking under the hedges .
Odds bobs , sir , if a poor body should but make water against the walls of other people that I have worked for - yes , and substantial  folks too - whew they would be sent to prison directly .


That is cruel .


Cruel , your Honour - why I tell you you are a nonsuch .
I am a good judge .
Look ye , sir , I was building up Sir James Ranter 's chimneypiece , and a block of marble fell , and lent me such a sliver as broke my arm - there 's a scar for you .
Well - I got two shillings for this stroke from Sir James , and two and twenty damns from the master-bricklayer , who therewithal discharged me for being careless .
But when I think of this , sir , my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth with revenge  it really makes me dry again .
One little drop more , if you please , sir .


With pleasure - drink heartily .


 And so , sir , you will act in contradiction to all the world ?
You will be a friend to the friendless ?


I will .


Then am I a sad scoundril to waste my time here in talking , when I might be better employed , saving your Honour 's remarkable presence , and when the sooner the work is done the better .


Saying this , the man rose up abruptly , made his bows , and ran off with his sledge of marble blocks as if they were so many feathers .


A mighty action I shall make of it after all , said I  here is a poor fellow who labours in the cause , and wishes to finish the work , though his  own interest depends on its continuance .


As I reflected on this matter , I regretted that a long habit of doing nothing , i. e. living like a gentleman , had made it impossible for me to work myself and pay others at the same time .


So then , said I , all the merit I can claim upon this occasion is making a decent use of a large fortune , which came to me by inheritance , without any effort on my part .
From this moment I looked on the multitude of workmen , which were variously employed , as more solid benefactors than myself .
Whether I ever had reason to change my opinion will be seen presently .
All things in their order .

MORE WEAKNESS , AND AN EXTRAORDINARY PETITION .


 THERE are singularities in my character , which , at different times , produced great pleasure and pain .
As I now passed by the files of labourers , each earnest in his occupation , I felt for them a genuine respect that led me incontinently to take off my hat , and even bow to several as I went along .
This must have seemed ludicrous enough , for I perceived every man suspending his work and looking at me with astonishment .
How sacred are the silliest customs !


 It was not without some astonishment too , on my part , that I saw Mr. Samuel , the steward , appear before me the next morning with a very dismal countenance , to tell me of a whisper that was running amongst the workmen not much to my advantage .
'T is really supposed , sir , said he , that you are a little injured here - pointing to his forehead .


Mad , Samuel !


No , no , sir , not absolutely mad  for , in that case , it would not be proper you should go about  only , as it were , shook or shattered a little at top .


Is it possible , Samuel ?


Most veritable  and they go so far as to tell me you was seen yesterday  running up to a man , and to rub the dust off his face with your handkerchief , whether he would or no  after which you made him sit down by you , crack jokes , tell a story , and such fancies  then , having amused yourself sufficiently , you fairly fuddled him with a quart bottle of Geneva , and sent him reeling away .
To finish the whole : the report goes , that you were seen to come in a moody manner upon the Green , and , casting up your eyes in a strange staring way , took your hat off your head , and bowed about on both sides of you , sometimes to men , sometimes to horses , and sometimes to mortar , as if you were crazy .


 Ridiculous , Samuel .
Too ridiculous to be attended to .


I have , as steward , a duty to discharge , sir , which , perhaps , may convince you to the contrary .
Pray read that paper , sir .


' The HUMBLE PETITION of the MASONS , CARPENTERS , BRICKLAYERS , CARVERS , and OTHERS , in Common Council assembled .


To SIR BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP , KNIGHT and BARONET .


SHOWETH , THAT , your petitioners are honest men and good workmen , and would not take advantage of any gentleman 's infirmity , willingly .


 THAT , they are in great forwardness with a new town , called Shenstone-Green  the intent of building which , very much surprizes your petitioners , who never heard of giving away a whole town before .


THAT , your petitioners believe your Honour to be a worthy gentleman , and as free with your money as we are with lime and mortar  but that your petitioners have seen such things in your Honour , as they can not make out .


THAT , your Honour hath pulled your hat off to your humble petitioners , who never had so much honour done them before , when at work .


 THAT , your Honour hath been seen to give half a crown to a boy who turned a barrow full of new bricks into a ditch , because you said , he , poor thing , must suffer for the misfortune more than the price of the bricks .


THAT , your Honour has been heard to talk very much and very loud to yourself , and choose , for this purpose , dark lanes , gloomy corners , and unfrequented places , such , indeed , as your petitioners would upon all occasions , save one occasion , assiduously avoid .


THAT , your petitioners have heard your Honour making strange noises , and holding long discourses in the night , and have been ear-witness ,  many and sundry times , to the words - My head is giddy - my heart is in flames - my soul is on fire - O SHENSTONE !
SHENSTONE !
SHENSTONE !
c. c. c..


THAT , one of your petitioners , being the other day on the opposite side of the hedge , looked through the twigs thereof , and saw your Honour weeping  after which , your Honour began to smile , and to assure the trees you were a great deal too happy .


THAT , your Honour diverted yourself two hours with making one of your humble petitioners dead drunk with drinking drams .


THAT , putting together all these circumstances , with some others which  give them additional force , your petitioners humbly apprehend your Honour is subject to fits that may hurry you into schemes of which you may repent while they are carrying into execution .
Your petitioners pray to know whether this is the case in regard to Shenstone-Green , because , if it were , they jointly agree to give up their jobb , and compromise for the cost of labour they have been already at .


THAT , if it is thus , your Honour had better stop in time  for , to confess the truth , we look on your Honour 's taking off your hat as much as to say - ` Pretty gentlemen , you are picking my pocket here finely . '
Your erecting a town ,  to make a present of , we humbly conceive to be out of the question  being an affair that will not hold water .
Your rewarding the boy for destroying the hundred of bricks , we imagine was ironically given , and by way of sneer , as much as to say - ` The sooner , my lad , you do my business , by completing my ruin , the better . '
Your getting into nooks and corners , talking to yourself , c. we apprehend to be on account of your Honour 's unwillingness to send us off the premises  your laughing and crying in the same breath frightens us almost out of our wits  and your Honour 's pleasing to make one of us drunk , we consider in no other way than that you wished him to send the sledge of marble  after the barrow of bricks .
- We , your petitioners , therefore , alarmed by these desperate symptoms , do most humbly beseech , and intreat , that your Honour will explain yourself to us , and tell us what is to be done .
Do this , and your petitioners shall for ever pray , c. c..


' My hand trembled all the time I read this petition , but resolved to treat it as a jest , at least in the presence of Samuel , I affected to smile , and demanded who might be the penman of this pleasant thing .
Little Phil .
Flourish the carver , sir , said Samuel .
He is a wit you know .


 That being the case , Samuel , said I , pray take this half guinea to the wit , and tell him , from me , to put the petition into as handsome a frame as possible , and , do you hear , let the glazier give it the additional decoration of a glass .


Samuel took the paper and the half guinea , and walked off in such a manner as convinced me he was both chagrined and disappointed .

INTRODUCES AN ODDITY .


 IN about two hours after , an odd figure of a man , with a rusty wig , and full-trimmed clothes , about three parts worn , and one part torn , came scraping his foot , and bending his body into my apartment , and said he had the honour to be admitted into the best families in Wales .


And will you favour me with your wrist , good sir , said he ?


Willingly - said I .


Ti - i - i - hi - we are all in a hurry - hard at work , hard at work ,  sir .
You have the pulse of a running-horse after his course .
Lack a-day !
lack a-day !
- how is your head ?
- Why the temples project , sir - put out your tongue - white as lime - milk , milk , milk , milk .


Pray , sir , who may I have the pleasure to converse with ?


Edward Elixir , sir  apothecary , surgeon , midwife , and physician , occasional , at your service , c. c. c..


And what is your opinion of my case , Mr. Edward Elixir , apothecary , surgeon , c. ?
And pray who told you , that your abilities were requisite at my house , Mr. Edward Elixir , surgeon , apothecary , c. ?


 Mr. Philip Flourish , the carver , sir , he came to me about an hour ago , as I was eradicating a tooth of Taff Toughjaw , my neighbour .
Sir , said he , I come to you in behalf of our patron at the mansion-house .
We have some reasons , which would be no secrets , were we to tell them to an apothecary .
- You know Mr. Flourish , I suppose , sir - We have some reasons to think , he ( our patron ) is not quite in good health .
He seems to us mazed .
Upon this , he went away , and I gave my word and honour to make you well without delay .
But do I not see the toe of a nasty consumption under your left eye .
Take care consumption  little Edward is at hand .


 Here he closed the lids , and examined .


Ah - ah - have I got thee ?
Sir , that consumption will I lay as flat as my forceps before it gets an inch forwarder .
Sir , there is not a disorder incident to man but is naturally and artificially afraid of Edward Elixir .
It is a Welch proverb now-a-days , to say , in case of a dangerous distemper , ` Elixir Ned Shall strike thee dead . '


Pray , Mr. Elixir , said I , does the poet here mean the distemper or the patient which is to be knocked dead ?


Well now , if I could not die of laughing at the divine conceit of  that - if I could not , may pestilence get the better of me .
How I do love to laugh - curse it and consume it how I do love to laugh .
I wish , sir , you had time to hear my history .
I tell my history to every patient .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
he !
he !
he !


They are patients in good truth , Mr. Elixir .


I swear by my scissars you will kill me , sir , if you go on in that manner .
Wit tickles me worse than the point of a feather .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
he !
he !
- Bright , bright , bright , bright , bright .


`` Immoderate laughing , says the proverb , is catching . ''
I joined the apothecary very heartily , without being able to assign any other reason  than that of seeing a little comical man in happy convulsions .


When you recover , Mr. Elixir , said I , you will return to my consumption .


When I recover !
- Jesus , Jesus , there 's another blow at my poor lungs and sides .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
When I recover !
Why , sir , your distemper seems to be a superabundant humour of wit .
How I do love to laugh !
But to return .
Physically speaking , then , how do you find yourself ?


Physically answering , I am morally sick of your foolery .
Lookee , Mr. Elixir , my workmen , and that Flourish you speak of , have played me a prank I do not approve  and , if  you are made a party in it , I shall be very much dispeased .


The Welchman 's face changed in a moment , and he protested he was a man of no skill , if he knew any thing more of the matter than the carver had told him , and whose words he had already repeated .


Upon the credit of this , I let him into the whole story , making him , at the same time , acquainted with all my designs , views , and passions , in regard to Shenstone-Green .


I had no sooner finished my discourse , than this unaccountable man jumped six or seven inches from his chair , skipped about the room , as skippeth a goat over the mountains  and then , shaking my hand , till we  were both red in the face , he caught up his hat , without saying a syllable , and set off from the house on the full stretch , running over the hills like a rabbit .


If thou goest by the way of Shenstone-Green , said I to myself , and if , peradventure , any of the workmen see thee , then will they swear the doctor is ten times madder than the patient .


This prophecy was really fulfilled  for , in less than three quarters of an hour , a party of the builders , armed with the instruments of their trade , had caught up the miserable apothecary , and were escorting him to the mansion-house , that , there , measures might be taken to send him home to his family in peace .


 I no sooner appeared at the door , in order to enquire the cause of this singular confusion , than the disastrous surgeon began to skip , and bound and snap his fingers over his head , and sing forth his Welch ditties , with more vigour than ever  but what was , at that time , more ridiculous still , the workmen seemed to stand aloof , as if afraid to advance .


At length , Mr. Philip Flourish , the carver and the wit , marched forwards to the head of the troop , and in a violent voice , for he was occasional a comedian , harangued as follows :


' Friends and fellow-workmen ,


SUFFER me to tell in the best language I am able , wherefore we are assembled :


 Noble Sir Benjamin Beauchamp !
you are our patron , and therein do we bear unto you respect .
Hear me , therefore , for my cause  and do you , carpenters and joiners , be silent that I may be heard .
Censure me in your wisdom , sir , and awaken those senses which we fear you have lost , that you may the better judge .
If there be any in this assembly that is the dear friend of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , to him I say that Phil .
Flourish 's love to Sir Benjamin is no less than his .
If then that friend demand why Brutus , I mean Philip Flourish , rose against our Caesar , that is to say , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , this , in the name of all the work-men , is my answer : - Not that we loved Sir Benjamin less , but that we  love our honour more .
As Sir Benjamin loves us , I weep for him  as he is throwing away his fortune , I am sorry for it  as he is a worthy gentleman , I honour him  but as he seems to be out of his own senses , and can put other folks ( as this poor apothecary , for instance ) out of their 's , we are afraid to come near him .
Thus , sir , there are fears for your loss of wits , honour for your goodness , and sorrow for your situation .
Who 's here so base that would not work for Sir Benjamin Beauchamp ?
Who 's here so rude that would pick his pocket ?
Who 's here so vile that does not pity this poor apothecary ?
I pause for a reply .


Mr. Philip Flourish having finished his harangue , in the tragic style , I  learned from a less rhetorical quarter , i. e. from the lips of Mr. Samuel Sarcasm , that the present noise had been occasioned by the conduct of Mr. Edward Elixir , who , on his departure from the mansion-house , ran upon the Green and jumped about , saying such extravagant things about my generosity , my wit , and my fine sense , accompanying all these assertions with such jestures as very fairly gave reason for the workmen to imagine there was something contageous in my disorder , the worst part of which had been , as they presumed , caught by the apothecary .


To crush all these fooleries and false suggestions by one decisive stroke , I took up the whole affair  on very serious ground , and insisted on being attended to .


I represented this to the gentlemen as very ill behaviour .
With regard to their petition , I observed , that I was willing to see it in the most favourable light  but , whatever I had done , or might do , depended on my own pleasure , for which I chose to pay in proportion .
That their part of the business was , peaceably to pursue each man his particular avocation till the work was finished .
That it was impertinent to enquire for what particular use I raised up to myself a town .
It was for them to do so much work , agreeable to my directions , for so much money  and that , if I chose  to build a palace for a parcel of horses , and put my friends in a pig-stye , it was wholly my affair , and not theirs .
The apothecary , Mr. Elixir , had been , I observed , sent by Mr. Flourish on a foolish errand  namely , to cure a man who was in perfect health  and that , as to his jumping about for joy , in talking of me , it might be partly from the vivacity of his constitution , and partly from the goodness of his heart , at hearing there was a man who had the courage to proceed in erecting a town to serve the Unfortunate , when it was found to be so very contrary to the sordid maxims of the world , that even the work-men were up in arms .


 This being a full explanation  I added , that I expected matters would go on regularly for the future , and that they would so far enlarge their hearts , as to pursue their duty with a diligent chearfulness  and that , while they were pursuing it , they should not think the worse of their patron 's understanding for acting by them more generously than some of their former employers .


The passions of a mob are never fixed .
These silly people now ran into the other extreme , and were , by the foregoing speech , so fully satisfied , that I was unanimously extolled as a paragon of sense and solid learning  as charitable beyond the reach of instances , and as the  best master that ever was worked for .


' Hereupon they released the apothecary , of whom they demanded many pardons  and then after giving me three cheers , they went hastily away , convinced I was in full possession of my senses , and that they would now go to work for me like so many devils .

THE PROJECT BECOMES POPULAR .


 THUS was every thing accommodated , and Shenstone-Green went on more briskly than ever .
In truth , every man appeared to do his utmost , and the progress of this united effort , became in a short time so apparent , that my village assumed a regularity and splendour which attracted the curiosity of the adjacent counties .
Sir Benjamin 's new town was a popular subject , and the echo of his good intentions reverberated from shire to shire .


Amongst others who had particularly contributed to this popularity ,  was the little Welch doctor , mentioned in the last chapter .
This man was so struck with the novelty of the project , that he took care to blazon it forth through all the families into which his loquacity or his skill could gain him access  and a talkative creature of his character and profession , in a dull part of the world too , where a little run-about thing skips from mountain to mountain to pick up news , is always welcome in one sense or another .
By such means , therefore , I was at once celebrated and delighted , for I will not attempt to conceal the satisfaction I received from this innocent flattery , and it so endeared to me , Mr. Elixir , ( whom I looked upon as in a great measure the source of it ) that I cultivated his  acquaintance , and had him with me at the mansion-house almost every evening .


Now then it was that I began to think my scheme in sufficient forwardness to give the finer and more affectionate finishes .
The houses being nearly completed , I imagined it time to think about getting them occupied  and in the mean time I gave directions for such embellishments in point of gardening as might leave nothing undone that could add elegance to convenience .
At an incredible charge I enriched a land , naturally unfruitful , till it was flowing with fragrance and breathing perfume .
Roses , jessamines , pinks , honeysuckles , and lillies , embroidered every  part , and , in the space of six months after the rubbish was removed , it would have been difficult to find in any part of Europe a spot more agreeably cultivated , or more adorned with beauties artificial and natural than Shenstone-Green .


This then was the period to bring down first my daughter , and then such of my friends as I thought would be most happy in such an asylum .
Paradise is here regained , said I .


Matilda , in consequence of these resolutions , was with me in a few days , and the emotions of her surprize , on her first sight of Shenstone-Green , does so much honour to human nature , of which she is an ornament ,  and of her father , who doats upon her , that it would rob the reader of entertainment , not to give them in her own language , just as they were conveyed in a letter to a lady , who afterwards became , and indeed is to this hour , a pensioner .


To Miss ELIZA ELLIOT .


WELL , dear Eliza , the last polishes are now giving to The Green .
I am just come from a first view , and from walking round the enchanting circuit .
The soul of Shenstone and of Sir Benjamin , shines through every part .
I was in this very spot about two summers ago , and remember it was impassible by means of weeds and  nettles .
It is now burnished with buildings , and blooming with flowers .
The great beauty of the place , simply considered , is suffcient to gratify the most delicate taste  but , when one adds thereto the generous purposes for which that beauty has been preparing , and considers it is designed to be a paradise for distressed virtue in every form  for merit superciliously over looked  and for genius which is spurned by ignorance  its value rises so on the imagination , that one is perfectly dazzled .
I am sure I am so to the greatest degree .
The idea is so delicious , so peculiar , so uncommon .
There is nothing now wanting but the furniture .
I do not mean chairs , glasses , tables ,  for those will be here in a few days , and are already ordered  but that nobler furniture of honest minds and generous hearts , made respectable by calamity , and sacred from their misfortunes .
Amongst these , my dear Elliot is invited as a valuable guest .
She is invited to enjoy the independence and serenity which she hath a right to claim , and which has so long been her due .
I have already , my dear , selected for you a house : it is embosomed by lillies and roses that almost emulate your own complexion .
It is in that quarter which lies nearest to the wood , and will , therefore , be less liable to the cold air , and make it more agreeable  for walking .
Here my Elliot shall forget to sigh  or , if that can not be , her sighs shall be buried in the bosom of a friend .
Do not fear that any wrong curiosity shall be set to work to extort from you that profound secret which you so firmly resolve to conceal .
It will not be a maxim at Shenstone-Green to oblige with one hand and violate with the other .
It is to be a sanctuary where innocence neglected , and worth abused , is to find absolute independence .
Come then , my dear , come in the full security of being as private as you can wish .
To share your anxiety it is only necessary to see it .
To explore the cause too critically , where it is purposely  veiled from the view , would be ungenerous .
Fear nothing , therefore , but hasten to Sir Benjamin and to


Your most affectionate friend , MATILDA BEAUCHAMP .

PETITION THE SECOND .


 ON the evening in which this letter was written , and sent by a servant to the post-town , the steward came once more into my room , with his sarcastical face , ( just as Matilda and I were in high chit-chat upon the charms of our project ) and begged an audience .


Speak , Samuel , said I , gayly .
What !
another petition , I suppose .


Sir , replied Samuel , my office obliges me to lay before you such things as come to hand upon the subject of Shenstone-Green .
At present I bear  a petition , it must be confessed  but it moves upon so different a principle , and is , indeed , in so different a style ( being altogether a panegyric on your Honour 's project ) , that I conceive it will have a different reception from the last .


Mr. Samuel , said I , if it is in praise of a project , which , I think , can not well be blamed , I desire to hear it  and , as I know you are not more of an oracle than an orator , pray sit down and bestow on it all the graces of your delivery .


Grey locks are no securities against the force of flattery , which we swallow upon almost any terms  even when the preparation is but bunglingly made up .
Thus , though this  compliment was equivocal , and equally admitted an interpretation of praise and censure , Mr. Samuel Sarcasm , old and arch , and white headed as he was , took it in the most soothing sense , and was put into perfect good humour .


Now for it , cried Matilda .


Samuel unfolded a paper , which , as usual , he had plaited very methodically , and , sitting down in front , exerted himself in giving all possible emphasis to what follows :


` The Second Humble Petition of the Carpenters , Masons , Bricklayers , Carvers , Gilders , Glaziers , Scourers , Painters , Gardeners , Whitesmiths , Blacksmiths and Brownsmith ,  in Common Council assembled .
- Superscribed to - . '
A very large and respectable body , Mr. Samuel , said I ( a little interrupting him . )


What can they possibly have to say , cried Matilda .


` Superscribed ( said Samuel , reading on ) to the most worthy , worshipful , sensible , sober , happy , hospitable , generous and gentlemanly , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , Knight , Baronet , and so forth , greeting . '
This , indeed , ( said I pretending to be pleased ) is in a strain of lofty eulogium that merits hearing , and a bottle of good port to whet the  whistle of the orator into the bargain .


And I will fetch it , said Matilda , getting up at the same time , and taking a bottle and glasses from a corner sideboard .


Samuel proceeded :


' HUMBLY SHOWETH ,


THAT , your petitioners ask ten thousand pardons for ever having supposed you were hurt in your senses  but assure your Honour , they judged only from the difficulty they had to believe any man , in his right reason , could be a friend to those whom almost all the world agree to despise  and whom they , therefore , thought  could not be countenanced without shame and disgrace .


THAT , your petitioners are now so thoroughly convinced of your Honour 's sound intellect , that they wish God Almighty had rather given them the power to imitate your example , than to censure it .


THAT , perceiving the town of Shenstone-Green now just upon finishing , is , to all intents and purposes , erected for all who are poor or dispirited , without regard to birth or connexions  they humbly address your Honour to take into consideration , the case of them and their families .


THAT , your petitioners are most of them , it is true , in possession of  their limbs  but that they are obliged , for the most part , to get their bread by the sweat of their brows , and have all the good will in the world to live the rest of their days like gentlemen , upon a pension of two hundred pounds a-year per annum .


THAT , your petitioners would like much to live in the houses they have built and beautified  and that , as they believe your Honour , now you have done with mortar , may want men , they do humbly propose , in order to save a great deal of trouble , as well as to give an opportunity of another good action , that they and their wives and children may take possession of the place , commonly called Shenstone-Green , situate , lying , and being upon a heath in the country  of Wales , in that part of it , commonly called Glamorganshire .


We , the under-signed , being those who have most hand in this petition , do most humbly pray for an answer .
God save the proprietor of Shenstone-Green !

It was not without a mixture of anger , pleasure , and indignation , that I could suffer Samuel to go through this curious catalogue .
Matilda fairly gave way to her youth , and  laughed so heartily , that even the rigid muscles of the steward were more than once put to trial .


But as the petition was in itself serious , I was about to signify my answer to Mr. Sarcasm , who drank his glass of wine , and waited for it with inexpressible gravity  when , in came the apothecary with a letter , which he told me had just come to his hand .


It was addressed To Mr. Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , who built Shenstone-Green  and it contained these words :


Mr. Sir BENJAMIN  or , Mr. Sir BEAUCHAMP .


I AM no scribe , as you see  but I am a man that scorns a mean action , as much as he who can  write a better hand .
I understand as how to night my fellow-workmen are come to a resolution to send you a petition for to get Shenstone-Green into their own hands .
This I take to be wrong - so I sit down to tell you they are all ( except John Sawe ) able to get their bread without begging it  and , as I am sure you may hit upon folks more misfortunate than they , who are hale hearty men , I hopes your Honour wo n't go for to disgrace yourself by harbouring such lazy drones , who may keep out the honest bees that would work to make honey , if they could .
I beg pardon for this trouble I give you  but I do it , because I would not see a gentleman 's kindness abused ,  and because I know if your Honour was to give an inch they would take an ell .
They are not worth much now  and if they were to have good houses , and jump into good fortunes , they would be sit for nothing .
No , no , choose for yourself .
There is woe enough lying about here and there , that may make your heart ach  and , in my notion , those who make the least noise , and who are almost ashamed to show their misery , are the men and women for your money .
I know they should be for mine  and so no more at this present writing , from your Honour 's loving and grateful friend and


Humble servant , HENRY HEWIT - that 's my name .


 POSTASCRIPT .
LEST your Honour should not know me by my name , I am the man whose face your Honour wiped when I was sledging the marble , and about whom so many lies were told .
They were jealous about wiping the face of such a poor fellow - that 's all .


HENRY HEWIT .


Upon my reading this epistle , the effects of its sentiment operated variously upon the various auditors .


Matilda , begged leave to withdraw .
She had , it seems , a sudden pain of the head .


Samuel coughed , and said , he wished he had not changed his new  half a crown  because when a man chose to make a present , it was his opinion , that half a crown was infinitely superior , in point of grace , which I can assure you he much studied - two shillings and sixpence !
it looked , he said , like slitting the favour into three parts .
The half crown had , he thought , more dignity .


I felt a something , for my part , flutter about my heart , as much as to say , mark down that man for Shenstone-Green .


But , Mr. Edward Elixir - how shall I describe properly the feelings of thee , Mr. Edward Elixir ?
If , reader , you recollect how heartily this man laughed in the fifteenth chapter , you will have some notion of the hearty  manner in which he wept on the present occasion .
His sorrow was as violent as his joy  and as he skipped about in many antick postures , ( for no chair could keep him sitting while he was under the influence of his feelings ) he called goats and gods to witness that , if that man 's cottage should be visited by all the plagues of Egypt , he would drive them all out gratis .
Yes , said he , I am a glass bottle if I would not bleed , bolus , and blister a dog which belonged to that fellow for nothing  yea , though I lost half my paying-customers in the mean time .
Jesus , how I do love to cry !
how I do love to cry !


If reader , this apothecary is not now as dear to thee as he then was ,  and still is , to me , then would I advise thee to lay down this volume , and take up any other that goeth less into the tender parts of the human character .


Please to intrust me with that same Henry Hewit 's letter , sir , ( said Samuel , the steward ) and it shall be read to the workmen as your reply for dismissing them and their petition .


Do so , Samuel , I replied , and bring Henry Hewit before me .
The steward set off faster than I ever saw him move before .

MR. ELIXIR , THE APOTHECARY , RELATES THE HEADS OF HIS STORY .


 FEW evenings of any life were passed more agreeably than that which succeeded the receipt of Henry Hewit 's well intended letter .
The apothecary staid the whole night , and enlivened the conversation by such sallies as those who do not well know the immense variety there is in human character , can form no idea .
Sir , said he , I will not say you shall make a Shenstonian of me  because , though I do very well to hop over the hills , I am afraid I should make a silly figure with a good house and two hundred a-year  unless , indeed , you  would give me the business of the Green in the way of my profession  in which case , Death should not often show his ugly face , I warrant him  but , however , as we have half an hour to spare , I will let you a little into the light of my present situation .


This was extremely acceptable to us , and Mr. Elixir began : I had never a regular education , sir , and my parents went to heaven before I commenced the practice of physic  otherwise , they might , perhaps , have been living upon earth still - but they lost that blessing for want of my not being born sooner .
I was at first a corn-cutter , and from thence I got the secret for curing swelled ancles .
White-swellings in the knee were the things which  next celebrated me - for away flew the tumours at the touch of my emolient .
My next advance was to relieve ladies in certain circumstances , and some of the finest persons in Wales are of my bringing forth .
After this , I formed and invented a medicine which removed all pains of the stomach , back , and loins  which nostrum was , I soon perceived , equally good for soreness in the breast .
In the next step , I invented a lenient to take wax and cornels from the neck .
Then I sent away coughs .
Then I conquered the tooth-ach  and , lastly , I found out the invaluable art of making the hair grow .
Thus , sir , in regular process and progress , I mounted , by the mere force of application and strong natural abilities , from the heel to the head  and now ,  thank God , I am at the head of my profession - for I as often prescribe as make up  not , between ourselves , that I think my genius for physic hath half so good an effect upon my patients as my humour and my good nature  for I am one of those , but I must not tell to the world , you know - I am one of those , who think half the maladies of mankind arise from melancholy , and that nature is , in generous tempers , generally to be laughed out of her megrims .
Thus I make it a rule to give innocent things - that is to say , I deal altogether in simples , and made the patient forget his pain as much as possible .
But there is one part of my character which has always stood in my way - Whenever I see people in real misery ,  I have not been able to keep my countenance , but fall incontinently to weeping , just as I did at Hewit 's letter  in which distress I have so much satisfaction , that , though it makes me as lean and meagre as one of my skeletons , I am more contented than a prince .
On the other hand , I have very often an opportunity to bring up my flesh again by contrary emotions  for if , either by stratagem or by nature , I can once set my patients to laughing , their cure is certain , and they have no more to fear .
At any rate , I am a very inoffensive little fellow , and pick up a goodish income for me and my wife , whom , as I hope to be saved , sir , I married because she has my faculty of laughing , and will sit opposite to  me in her arm chair ( which , God bless her , she fills bursting full ) and titters at nothing by the hour together .
Oh !
she 's a sensible woman , sir  and though she is so lusty , I am fain to trundle her about the parlour for exercise  she does make such fine remarks on medicine and on human nature , and on the growth of the human hair , that , if I were a penman , I would put her down for publication .
What a capital volume in folio would my wife be !
Even in sheets she cuts a very respectable figure , I presume Mr. Elixir , said I .


Ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
replyed the apothecary .


Mr. Elixir was now again set in for the above ha !
ha !
ha !
diversion ,  and tossed himself from chair to chair , panting and fuming with his convulsion , for near twenty minutes .
Oh !
various Nature  how dost thou sport with us thy little creatures !


After this , Elixir spoke .


We live , I say sir , comfortably  but I am not absolutely in the richest part , you know , of the habitable globe , and my customers who pay , are in no proportion to those who do not pay .
The truth is , I will cure a man at any time if he will but either laugh or cry with me  and , as I have taken notice those are the two matters most in practice in this world , I think I stand a good chance to be supplied .
Yet I must tell you , that though I choose always  to laugh in company , I had always a thousand times rather cry alone .


Odds so , odds so , that 's true ( said he , recollecting himself ) I have a poor thing that I must see to-night , and she lives full a mile from hence .
She must not be weeping in her bed , while I am telling you a history that is not worth six-pence .
Besides , she is poor .


Upon this our master of physic sprung up , and hurried out , in the middle of as dark and rainy night , as , in Summer , could possibly be .


God be with thee poor fellow , said I , go where thou wilt !
May Providence keep every storm from thy heart !


 That he will , papa , replied Matilda , you may depend upon it .
Here my daughter took out her pocket-book and pencil .
What are you writing Matilda , said I ?
Only the names of persons whom I recommend to you as proper , sir , for The Green .


Let me see , my dear ?


Mr. Edward Elixir and wife - Two hundred pounds per annum .


Mr. Henry Hewit and family - Two hundred pounds per annum .


John Sawe to be protected .


Agreed Matilda , said I .


Thus ended our evening .

MR. SAMUEL SARCASM , THE STEWARD , SETS OUT ON A REMARKABLE JOURNEY .


 I WAITED now only for the approach of the next Spring ( which was advancing ) to people my new village .
The workmen were all paid off and discharged , except John Sawe , the worthy exception made by Henry Hewit , and some few others , who were retained as traders in the service of The Green .
But the most delicate and embarrassing part of the business yet remained  this was , to announce my intentions to the necessitous and unhappy , in such a manner , as might offer protection unaccompanied by insult .
Here was a  nice point .
I was effectually puzzled .
The steward advised , that I should distribute a printed hand-bill , in the way of , ` Walk in , gentlemen , walk in , to give way - The Green . '
At another time , he recommended me to place over the doors some large signs , either of wood or metal , with the following inscription for the use of travellers : ` Entertainment and an annuity , for man and horse , here , GRATIS . '
But these sarcasms , you may be sure , I avoided .
They were amongst the waggeries woven into that honest man 's constitution  and so , in consideration of his other good qualities , I forgave him .
Matilda was of opinion , that being for public utility , the advertisement could not be too general  and , therefore ,  advised the mode of the News-papers .
But this did not seem to me sufficiently delicate .
After much deliberation , I resolved upon the following method , out of many others which seemed to be less plausible , viz .
That Samuel should be sent with circular letters from me to all my friends , in capital situations , to recommend such of their humble or unhappy acquaintance , as might , upon their experience , deserve a protection in Shenstone-Green  and also , that the like project should be seconded by Matilda in the letters which she should send over town and country at the same time .


One fair morning therefore , preparations having been made , Mr.  Samuel Sarcasm clapped the saddlebags across his favourite pad , and was as well laden with letters as any mail whatsoever .
But , he had not been absent three days before we received from him the following epistle :


To Sir B. BEAUCHAMP .
SIR ,


LOOKING upon it that I am charged with such a commission as no steward had ever before in trust , I am willing it should be so done as to hand down my name to posterity in a way to do it honour .
Being now , as I take it , on the road of immortality , it behoveth me not to stumble .
It is to this end that I am baiting my horse at  a hedge ale-house , in my way to London , where most of your letters are directed .
The horse , I say , sir , eateth while I write to know the full extent of my commission .
I forgot to ask certain particulars before I set out  so pray tell me if I am to go to London right on  or , whether I may make such excursions as seem to promise me , in the vagabond way , any success ?
Am I to take notice of any ragged tatterdemallions that I may meet , overtake , or follow upon the road - such as beggars , gypsies , c. - or am I to let them alone ?
I have already passed several very ill-looking fellows , and as many dirty husseys , who , I verily believe , would not refuse to become our pensioners .
 There was particularly a man with a shock head of hair , and two wooden legs , who accosted me yesterday , in God 's name , to give him a shilling .
By the splendour of his demand , ( being eleven times more than ordinary beggars have the impudence to ask ) I am persuaded he would like to lay his stumps upon The Green .
If I had given him any encouragement , he would certainly have undertaken to hop to you in about forty eight hours  nay , he worked away upon his timber ten or a dozen paces to show me how he could move  but I have let him slip through my fingers .
If you think he is a prize , sir , I will contrive to pick him up and pack him in a cart  or , if your Honour  chooses , in a coach , as I come back .
Even in this pot-house , ( where I am using the vilest pen and most polluted paper upon the most virtuous subject ) there are half a score as pretty , that is to say , as ugly , objects for the pension as you could wish .
I do not believe there are twelve ounces of wholesome human flesh amongst the ten  and , to all appearance , not above a shirt and an half , were one to tack all their slips of linen together .
If these would not be glad of your Honour 's patronage , I do not know who would .
From what has been said then , sir , you will perceive that I could get a number of recruits ( and almost all such as are too frightful for any hospital  but your Honour 's ) as I go along  Fail not then to let me know the bounds of my authority , and I remain , in the mean time ,


Your Honour 's Most faithful servant and steward , SAMUEL SARCASM .


In answer to this characteristic epistle , I only desired Mr. Samuel to do as he was directed , and send me , for the future , more business than wit .
After this , he proceeded in his journey .
Two months passed before I heard any further tidings  but at the end of that period , I received Mr. Samuel 's second epistle , which you will find in the next chapter .

THE STEWARD STOPS ON THE ROAD TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE PROPRIETOR .


 To Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP .
SIR ,


THINKING you have already been at some small expence in the building of Shenstone-Green , I have been sparing of making your Honour pay postage .
I forbore to write till writing was necessary .
It seems to be particularly so at present .


I shall set out by observing that I have delivered all your letters to your GREAT friends , most of whom  are so charmed with your Honour 's scheme , that , instead of recommending others , they would , with very little persuasion , accept of your offer themselves .
In short , sir , I have in the course of this original journey seen more of the world than I ever saw in all the former parts of my life .
Yet I knew men before .
Why London is a sort of Shenstone-Green - I mean , sir , the court quarter - and the King of England is only another Sir Benjamin Beauchamp .
His Majesty , like your Honour , provideth his fine folks with a house and an annuity for - doing nothing  and they are so tired with the fatigue of that employment , that I see plainly they would turn themselves  out of one place to catch at another , were it only for the exercise of changing a posture .
I am in a desperate quandary how to act  for , as I said before , two hundred pounds a-year , and a good house , is an object with almost every man and woman to whom your Honour and Miss Matilda sent letters .
On one score or another , they find reasons to baffle all my endeavours to recommend , by their means , the unfortunate , and intreat my interest on their own accounts .
Had I been a man who liked dirty money as well as clean money , sir , I could have made this tour turn out very decently , for several brilliant bribes have been held up between mine honesty and my avarice .
It is two  months since from day to day I have been put off by these your great friends , sir , on the solemn promise of receiving a catalogue of proper objects when I next called  but I am as far off as ever , except that I have picked up a couple of gentlemen , whom I think may do , and whom I shall send down by the stage to Shenstone-Green .
You have been sorely mistaken , sir , in your notion of the riches and situations of those you wrote to  and I do not think you will be the better esteemed for having thus , as it were , thrown out a lure , to get at the bottom of their circumstances .
It was a golden mistake while you were in ignorance , sir , but having once caught this secret , and , to say  the truth , trepanned them out of it , ` twill be a moot point whether you keep their good will or lose it .
Ah !
sir , London connexions were not , I doubt , the proper ones to point out that kind of modest merit and obscure virtue which you want for Shenstone-Green .
I found all but one man ( and of him I may speak hereafter ) in that sort of dazzling hurry which prevented either his seeing or hearing .
One of your friends , sir , at the time of my waiting upon him was bargaining for a trinket , which the vender valued at fifty guineas , and which the buyer designed , as he said , for a present to his mistress  while , at the other end of the room , stood a poor fellow nipping his hat , and  soliciting five guineas to pay his lodgings .
How doth your Honour think this matter ended ?
Why the gentleman paid down the fifty guineas for the toy , and told the petitioner that he was out of cash just then , but might call next week , or the week after .
Underneath , sir , are the several names of your great London friends , who are willing to accept of your Honour 's protection , your house , land , and money , to almost any amount .


They insist on my sending down the list before I proceed  and as you will best judge yourself , sir , how far they are , or are not , objects , I shall not intrude any remarks  but beg your Honour 's  reply , as London is too young a place for the very old


SAMUEL SARCASM .


N. B .
The list is of my own making out  for , though most of the parties are near and intimate friends , living in great splendour , they all charged me to conceal their application from all eyes but those of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp  so that you see how the gay imposition passes here , sir , and that most of your great friends are in the road to ruin , because each man is ashamed to confess that he is jealous of his neighbour 's finery and folly .
Thus , sir , though you receive the application of many , every individual hugs himself on the secrecy  with which his business is carrying on by the medium of S. S .


' A LIST of the NOBILITY and GENTRY who are the GREAT FRIENDS of Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP , and CANDIDATES for the SHENSTONE PENSION .


LORDS .


Lord Lacewell .
Hath thirteen livery servants , six carriages , and two blacks  but would live with his beloved Beauchamp in a family way .
N. B .
This nobleman 's house and furniture advertised in the papers for auction , Feb. 9 .
I read it at breakfast .


 Lord Luckless .
A very fine man , with a very fine house .
Also two persons out of livery , sitting in the hall , fronting the door , to see that nothing is removed off the premises , without their - permission .
Lord George Gildcover .
Hath the largest library of - wooden books I ever saw .
Remarkable for having the best imitations of leather bindings in England .
Lord S. Scourgreen .
Says , he will sell his studd ( which I find as been empty these six weeks ) to live at Shenstone-Green with his dear Benjamin .
COMMONS .


George Gravely , Esq. .
Read your Honour 's letter in bed , where he  lies smarting under an agony of the groin - curses town , and wishes for a retreat in the country .
This is the gentleman your Honour thought so remarkably prudent .
N. B. Drank with his footman , who told me , in a whisper , that his master owes his present illness to a jade who was turned away yesterday morning for - misdemeanours .


Mr. Benson .
This merchant , would very much like two hundred pounds a-year .
He tells me ( in confidence ) , that there is no more good to be done in the Alley , and that a snug birth in Shenstone-FOLLY ( I give your Honour his own words )  would be better than battling it upon Change at present .
D. Thurlby .
R. Brown .
S. Chapman .
B. Smith .
J. Beckford .
R. Oglevie .
D. Davenant , and H. Templar , Esquires .
Have all been so long on the town , that they would like to kick up a dust in the country . '
I could not help feeling great surprize and indignation as I read this list  for , such is the face that every one of those persons put upon their circumstances and their conduct , that they had for many years passed upon  me ( who was their old country correspondent ) as men of the first fortune and fashion .
On comparing the present catalogue with that given in by the workmen , I could not but imagine , that the bricklayer , who fell from a ladder in the year 1717 , the man who was much subject to corns , and the boy who overset his barrow in the ditch ( because he was thicksighted ) had infinitely more fair pretention to the pensions of Shenstone-Green , than any of these honourable gentlemen , of whose ways and means of existing and wasting , I had been so very long ignorant .
I congratulated myself , however , that , by this enquiry , I had obtained a knowledge of real character , and immediately gave orders that the steward should return into Wales .

SHENSTONE-GREEN IS NOT PEOPLED WITHOUT A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE .


 BY this time it appeared perfectly plain , that I must depend only on the care and diligence of a few other friends , who , on trial , were not living in a state of gay deception  and that , where such care and diligence failed , I must trust to the effects of a public advertisement .
I do assure you , reader , it is more troublesome to get a town reputably populated , than to build it .
This was so sacred a truth , in my case , that the middle of the Summer shone off before I  could say Shenstone-Green was properly inhabited .
Whether , indeed , it was ever properly inhabited , may admit of a doubt .
However , I shall not trouble the reader with any further delays on this point  but , cutting the disagreeable interval of barren application short ( which is an honest author 's duty ) , will carry him at once to the time , when , after many difficulties , my houses were mostly occupied , and my prospect of pleasure brought , apparently , to a crisis .


You are now , therefore , to suppose , that a sufficient number of persons , well chosen and cautiously recommended , are assembled upon the Green  part of whom enjoy the irrevocable life-pension , and part are  set up in trade for the general good .
All my views are nearly completed , as far as regards external preparation .
The summer is before me .
Many families , who were pining in want , are in the bosom of indulgence .
THE GREEN is in full flower .
There are walks for pleasure , bowers of ease , and a church for devotion .


Though this chapter is very short , I shall end it directly  on purpose to give you leisure to wish me joy of a great piece of work well terminated .

THE STEWARD SHEWS HIMSELF TO BE A MAN OF SENSE .


 IF you have not sufficiently revelled in the airy luxury which you , doubtless , suppose me to partake , it would be almost a pity to disturb you with the truth .
Yet , as it is the design of this narrative , not only to divert , but to warn , I must descend from visionary pleasure to mere matter of fact .


At this place , therefore , properly begins The Narrative of the good People of Shenstone-Green - A History of Human Nature  or , The New Paradise Lost .


 The satisfaction with which I saw so many happy human faces about me ( for happiness really resided with us almost a whole month ) , is indescribable .
Many of the pensioners I had long known , others were such as came sanctified by the warmest encomiums from such as I could thoroughly credit  for , luckily , ALL my friends did not correspond with the characters in Mr. Samuel 's catalogue .
The trading part of our society settled apart from the circus in a comfortable way , but with due regard to subordination .
The regulations of The Green were few  and those extremely delicate .
All the parade of ringing the community to dinner , or to prayers , was inconsistent with my idea of independence .
 I had established a commonwealth , in which every man was to please and enjoy himself in his own way  nor was there any other restriction , except that the tradesmen were not to mix in the walks or amusements of the pensioners within the circus , unless particularly invited .
For my own part , I considered myself very impartially as the frank friend and familiar companion of every individual , and , lest any sort of jealousy should arise , I endeavoured , as much as might be , to distribute my attention in equal proportions .
The greatest anxiety which I experienced , arose from a certain fear of seeming , in the eyes of some , to be a man who enjoyed his pre-eminence .
To avoid which , I cast off the dignity of the  person of fortune even more than usual , and brought myself upon a level with the lowest .


To such a community , who would not give at least a twelvemonth 's unanimity ?
Had you seen , reader , the joy with which every pensioner spoke of his situation , while the charm of novelty gilded it  with how animated an eye every man surveyed his little portion of property , and with how enraptured a step he walked along his own garden , you would have imagined there was little reason to expect an alteration .


I was myself so entrapped by appearances , and so much in the heaven I had expected , that , meeting the steward one evening after I had been  walking , like a common parent , from door to door , as was my custom , well Samuel , said I , what do you think of my project now ?
Confess man , that your apprehensions were illfounded  confess , that Shenstone-Green is the happiest spot in the whole world .


Many men have many minds , sir , said Samuel  it would be atrocious in me to break in upon a gentleman 's pleasure , though he is , as it were , trusting his hopes to sea in an eggshell .
Far be it from me to brew the tempest  but , as your Honour hath imposed on me this stewardship , in which if I increase my profits , I increase also my pains , I think it my duty to speak my  mind  and this I can do with the more assurance , as I have obstinately refused any kind of family-advantage , from a scheme which I never did , nor ever shall , relish .
Not that I am without persons , sir , in my family to whom two hundred pounds a-year would not be a comfortable sinecure  but I am an industrious man myself , and do not like to cherish idleness in any of my race .
Add to which , your Honour shall never have it to say that Samuel Sarcasm put it out of his power to speak his honest sentiment ( on this atrocious occasion ) by taking a sort of bribe .
Every one knows the effect of hush money .
I scorn it .
That being the case , I wish your Honour would hear me .


 And what wouldst thou say , Mr. Samuel Cicero , the conceited , said I ?


I would say , sir , replied Samuel , that your scheme is not better put together than was that of your renowned rival Don Quixote de la Mancha .
Why , sir , do you imagine any human society can long preserve its harmony without regulations ?
Here have you brought together into one little spot of ground more than half an hundred people , all , or mostly all , strangers to each other .
Do you forget that with that half an hundred of people you have crowded also into the same space at least half a thousand contrary passions ?
You will say , in reply , that most of these pensioners are exalted from adversity to prosperity   I answer , so much the worse : the transition is too rapid .
That misfortune which is taken away all at once creates a levity that is ominous  but , if it is removed by degrees , the head and heart may possibly bear it decently .
It is confessed , some of these persons have been ruined by their ill stars , others by their ill , or at least their imprudent conduct .
I might even admit that not one of them is vicious  but I must insist also , that every one is an human being , and , consequently , addicted to old habits , and not brought without difficulty to the adoption of new  nay , I myself sir , do not , nor can not , feel myself at home in this same steward 's lodge that you have built up for me .
It is , to be sure , larger , finer , gayer ,  grander  but it has not , as I may say , the ease of the old slipper about it .
It wants a thousand little things that , in fact , may be of no figure , but in the estimation of fancy , who is the goddess of us all , more or less , they are of immeasurable magnitude .
Perhaps , sir , you will laugh , when I tell you that , in my new lodge I miss the three wooden pegs - on which I was , for so many years , accustomed to hang my hat , my great coat , and my cane-string .
It is true there are a dozen fine showy brass hooks , of which one might make the same use  but , if I tell you that , in my notion , they do not fit my purpose so well , or rather that they do not fit my fancy , you must blame human nature and not me , who am only a poor imperfect  atom from the dust of the earth .
Be assured , sir , nothing in the world , but my loving your Honour 's quiet better than my own , could make me spend the twilight of my day , when all should go on still and softly , amongst a set of idle creatures collected into one little circle , where it is as impossible they should subsist in tranquillity as it is for yon steeple to stand without a foundation .
I beg your pardon , dear and honoured sir , I beg your pardon , but you will find it as I say .
I know the species - I know the species .


Oh !
no , my good fellow , replyed I , much softened by his conversation , that may be the case with societies in general , but Shenstone-Green is so picked , so guarded on the one hand with  by gratitude , and on the other by convenience , that , depend on it , you will find yourself agreeably mistaken .


I wish it heartily , answered the steward , for to keep your generous temper in the same golden dream , I could almost wish , for once , the order of nature inverted .
But , I sir , am an old fellow that have looked quietly into the heart of man for many years  and I fear you have built up a village full of arguments against the possibility of your happiness .
Men carry their natures and wonted dispositions wheresoever they go .
But my duty calls me away , as I see by yonder clock at the side of the church , and therefore I humbly take my leave of your Honour .

CONTAINING THREE GREAT SURPRIZES  ONE FOR THE READER , AND TWO FOR CERTAIN CHARACTERS .


 THERE is a particular kind of conversation which seizes upon all the faculties of the hearer , and leaves him in an anxious state betwixt doubt and conviction .
Such was the emotion at this time wrought in my mind by the sentiments of the steward whom I never considered before as any thing beyond a shrewd sarcastic being  but in this last discourse , which , by the bye , he delivered in a tone unusually persuasive , there appeared to be a sagacity and knowledge of men , manners , and nature ,  that struck me .
I confess I was even startled .
The possibility of having so long laboured in vain - the bare possibility of a disappointment in a hope so tender and so indulged , threw me into a very deep pain of thought .
It was the hour of night too , in which meditation is heightened , The moon shone , and I indulged my resveree .


Under such influence I rambled into the wood that lay at the back of the buildings , and there I sat down upon a bench which was shaded by the thickest foliage of several beeches , while it at the same time commanded two or three of the different paths .


Presently along the most sequestered of these appeared the figure of a  female , who sighed sorely and repeatedly , as she passed .
She paced backwards and forwards for some time , and at last stood fixed with her eyes up-lifted to the moon , whom she addressed in the following manner : Oh !
divine and silver Queen of the Night !
If he still lives whom I adore , may his bosom be calm and unruffled as thy ray at this moment .
May his heart never share the agonies which he has heaped upon Eliza .
If , Cynthia , thou art indeed the guardian of the Chaste , exert thy utmost influence , that he may not ultimately be lost to Eliza !


I was just going to rise and advance , when the rustle of the leaves  behind me , and after that , the surprize of a plaintive voice repeating these verses , deterred me :


In these deep solitudes and aweful cells , Where heavenly pensive Contemplation dwells , And ever musing Melancholy reigns , What means this tumult still in SIDNEY 'S veins ?
When the voice ceased , I perceived a man with his arms folded , sliding , as it were , round a groupe of semicircular bushes which led him into the front path where I had , a little before , seen the lady .
Here , in less than a minute , the two met , exactly in the instant that each was pronouncing the name of the other .


My great God !
- exclaimed the lady .


 Oh !
righteous heaven !
- cried the gentleman .


No , sir  ( said the lady , disengageing herself on a sudden from the embraces of the stranger ) I am still Eliza .
I ask not by what means you found me in this asylum - I am wronged .


I sought it to soothe my sorrows in a new and unknown part of the world .
It is on this principle that I am Sir Benjamin 's pensioner .
I arrived two days ago .


And you will depart to-morrow .
It is impossible for both of us to taste the benevolence of the patron of this place .
My injuries are still in my heart .


 And is no part of Sidney there , Eliza ?


Ought any part of Sidney to be there ?
- answered Eliza , in the most penetrating tone .


Ah !
madam , it was my accursed delicacy , and the pride of my youth - it was not my heart that ever injured my Eliza .
I have been by the world , and its follies , reduced to the want even of bread since we last parted  and had it not been for the benevolence of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , who takes me merely on the credit of some unknown friend , I had been utterly lost .


Too proud to own Eliza , sir , I sind , even when you wanted bread .
 But I have served you , Mr. Sidney , in despite of yourself .


You ?
- you - Eliza ?


I was the unknown friend , who took care that , if you were living , you should be an inhabitant of Shenstone-Green .


Obligations , madam , heaped on the head without hope of repayment - I say , Eliza , there are minds - minds of a certain frame , which - .


Fresh injuries , Mr. Sidney !


No , madam  the balance is even - nay , I know not but the scale may turn in my favour .
You was at a masquerade in some danger - Recollect .


 My very life and honour was preserved by a generous domino .


It was so , Eliza  and I triumphed in disguise .


Save me from ruin  yet refuse to speak , or to discover yourself , sir .


For that very reason , I can not bear to be out done by Eliza .


Nor I by Mr. Sidney .
I will be revenged yet - nay , I have been so .
You are in my debt after all .


Impossible , madam .


Remember your situation at Mr. Joshua 's .


Ha !
- Go on .


The scratch of the sword is still in my arm , sir .


 Confusion , madam  you rescue my body to stab my sould - my sensibility is bleeding at every pore .
I had rather die than not be on an equality with Eliza .
Her superiority kills me - but one way is yet left .


Name it .


My joy at finding you here is so big and so unexpected , that I shall certainly soar above even the ambitious flights of Eliza  for I will bear to be her inferior , and , for the first time in my life , yield up the delicacy of being on a level with the woman I adore .


Then you have conquered .
- Ah !
Sidney , why so long in yielding ?
- What miseries might have been prevented !


 Blessed be Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , Eliza !
- We are safe in his paradise - he is the guardian of our sanctuary .
( My heart fluttered , reader . )


He is more a God within the last hour than ever , for I now know he is in possession of Mr. Sidney .


Take care , Eliza , your very tendernesses must not surpass mine .
Your love , madam , is not superior .


Is not a kiss usually the seal of a lover 's forgiveness , Sidney ?
- I suppose you know that our delicacy demands , as usual , inviolable secrecy .
No body is so much as to suspect our passion .
Love is hurt by being known to a third person .


 Have I ever , madam , been void of that sacred and essential delicacy ?


But a hint , you know -


Is an insult , madam .
- I am as nice as yourself .


Not more so , sir .


No - perhaps , not more so .


Perhaps - !


I tell you again , Eliza , I will bear , to-night that you shall hold the first place in the dignity of passion .
Triumph , triumph , Eliza .


On that score , then , we are - friends .


Friends , madam ?
- no , we are not friends .


 Lovers - lovers - if you will - Lord , why do n't you take my hand then and kiss it as you used to do ?


Here these over-delicate lovers , who had thus met by accident , went out of the wood in the greatest harmony , after all those little spars which discover affection .
I left my bench , and followed them so as not to be seen , had they even looked back .
Curious to know the full extent of this uncommon delicacy of sentiment , I pursued them even to the door of the lady 's house , at which they exchanged kind expressions , and very modestly separated .
The gentleman tripped across the Green to his own apartments .


 The exultation I felt at the finishing of this transaction was by no means inconsiderable .
All the sombre ideas which the steward had spread about me were vanished .
No , no , Samuel , said I , there is no truth , after all , in thy seemingly solid sentiments .
If my adventures continue to go on as they have begun , Shenstone-Green shall boast its empire over the heart as well as the imagination .
A lover is already restored to his mistress , and though both may be a little too punctilious , said I , both are amiable .


I now walked home to bed , kissed my darling Matilda , ( as it was always my rule before I went to rest ) and then dreamed of Sidney and Eliza .
Happy rest to Thee , reader .

BEGINS WITH THE PROPRIETOR 'S BENEVOLENCE , AND ENDS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A WHISTLER .


 THE next morning 's sun rose golden upon Shenstone-Green , and I went early forth into the adjacent fields to taste the loveliest hours of the four and twenty .
As I passed the circus , ( than which nothing in Eden could well have been more beautiful ) I felt a kind of sensation which seemed to say , these fair environs are , Benjamin , of thy own creation  it was thou who caused the rose-tree to be thus saluted by the dashing dew-drop .
Yon lillies , pinks , and eglantine , which send  their odours on the zephyr , were of thy planting .
And , ah !
more voluptuous and more dear to thought , thou it was who adorned these little repositories with the happy souls which now inhabit them , and caused every dwelling to be surrounded with sweets .
The very sun seems to dart on thee , as thou thus standeth in the centre of thy works , his rising ray of approbation .
Every pensioner is now in the balmy arms of sleep .
Lovers , who were before divided , are dreaming of to-morrow 's interview .
The lately-separated husband and wife are brought again , by thy means , into the bed of reconciliation .
The invalids of the place are reposing themselves .
Those who had fallen from the heights of fortune into the vales  of distress , have here a cradle in which they are lulled into peace .
In a word , thy whole family is at this moment in elysium .


Ah !
SHENSTONE , wert thou but here to complete the felicity which was by thee suggested , how perfect would it be !
This fond idea led to a consideration of that amiable man 's moral character , and I could not help exclaiming , in the words of a poet who at once imitated and lamented him :


They call'd him the pride of the plain - In sooth he was gentle and kind  He mark'd in his elegant strain The graces that glow'd in his mind .
On purpose he planted the trees , That birds in the covert might dwell  He cultur'd the thyme for the bees , But never would rifle the cell .
 Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet , Go bleat , and your master bemoan  His music was artless and sweet  His manners , as mild as your own .
I had by this time got into the fields , where I perceived walking with large full strides over the ridges of the land , a man who seemed to be crossing the country on some business of the utmost dispatch .
He was tall and well made , but in that sort of dress in which appeared the marks of a gentleman reduced .
He had an handkerchief in his hand , with which , from time to time , he wiped his forehead .
His shoes had all the look of having laboured through a long journey , and the dust of the road had deeply embrowned his once-white stockings .
Yet , notwithstanding all  these marks of a vagabond , there shone through his shabbiness a certain air of fashion and dignity , which denoted him to have known better days .
Upon seeing me walking along the green side of the hedge , he still quickened his pace till he came up to me , whistling all the way extremely loud .


We exchanged bows .


Sir , said the stranger , in a noble and full pronunciation , can you direct me the nearest way to the mansion of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp ?


Have you any particular commands with that gentleman ?


No commands , sir  but many entreaties .
I come with recommendations to him from particular friends .


 Who may those friends be , sir ?


They are , as I understand , the only ones who could procure a man the honour of Sir Benjamin 's protection .


Have the goodness to name them .


Poverty and a feeling heart .


Powerful advocates it must be confessed , sir .


Yes , they are so  and it is under such splendid patronage , that I have the confidence to offer myself as a candidate for Shenstone-Green .
There , sir , is a voucher for my truth .


Here he took from his pocket a letter , and again requested I would direct him on his way .


 I believe , sir , said I , looking at the superscription , you may suffer me to break the seal of that letter .


Whew , cried the stranger , how could I be so long mistaken ?
Where is fled , all at once , my knowledge in the history of human faces ?
How has it been possible for me to overlook lineaments so palpable ?
That open brow , and that expanded eye - to whom could they belong , but to Sir Benjamin Beauchamp !
There , sir , read your letter .


LETTER


To Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP .


DEAR OLD FRIEND ,


YOU still ask me to collect candidates for Shenstone-Green , which you have built on a very new plan  indeed .
This scrawl will be put into your hand , by a person whom I have known as many years as I have known your .
In all that time , his immense riches appeared his least attraction .
We have monuments of him in several parts of this city , which will carry his character , with that of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , to posterity .
To my utter astonishment , he now complains of a sudden turn which makes him seek a sanctuary with your Shenstonians .
I have myself offered him money to any amount .
He rejects all examination into his affairs  and says , the only favour I can possibly do him , is to say a decent thing for his distress to my old friend Sir Benjamin .


 With regard to decent things , as he calls them , were I to say all which I know of Mr. Seabrooke , the bearer , I must write a volume , and not a letter .


I am , dear Sir Benjamin , Your old friend And humble servant , P. PECKHAM .


London .
Mr. Seabrooke , said I , as soon as I had finished this letter , the only matters which distress me on this occasion , are , first , the inconsiderable size of the Shenstone premium , when it is compared to the property which you have been accustomed to command  and secondly , that you should have been under the necessity of coming  to your little pittance on foot .
Had I known , sir - .


Whew - Sir Benjamin , said Mr. Seabrooke interposing , do not you be afflicted at the very things which form a material part of my happiness .
There is great variety , in a man of my temper , in thus stepping from an unweildy fortune , to such a one as I can very well manage .
It cuts off superfluous anxiety .
It is like entering a neat cottage ( where one detects an impropriety in a moment ) , after coming suddenly out of great apartments , whose length and vastitude prevent the possibility of being accurate .
With respect to walking , it is the favourite exercise of my life  I sometimes divert myself  with objects on the road , which , my being on a level with them , offers to observation  and yet , which , had I been perked up beyond my natural height on the back of a horse , would have been all overlooked .
In a gay may-lady , or in gilded bug  in the twist of a branch , or in the colours of a flower  I see a satisfaction , which , though I very sensibly feel when I am in the proper humour , I shall not attempt to describe .
If , therefore , you have the goodness to give me my own way , you will bestow one of the smallest houses of your new town , and slit the yearly pension between two .


In the course of this conversation , I had turned about towards The  Green , and we were on the way home to the mansion-house .


And this , I presume , is your New Paradise ( said the gentleman , as we came within view of Shenstone-Green ) .
Here , you amuse yourself in a way wherein you will find few to applaud , and none to imitate you .
For my part , the chief satisfaction I shall find under your protection , is to live in this fair world , and join the chorus of happy creatures in their oraisons and vespers of , gratitude .
Whew - what a divine Sir Benjamin you are !


I led Mr. Seabrooke from hence to the mansion-house , where he , I , and Matilda , sat comfortably down to breakfast .


 Young lady , said he to my daughter , you see a very proud beggar before you .
I am come to seduce your worthy father , by a whining tale , out of two hundred a-year and a good house .
As you are his only daughter , and consequently his heir , pray how do you relish this scheme ?


My father , replied Matilda , is in full possession of my sentiments on that head  and will , therefore , more gracefully inform you of them , than it is in my power .
Yet , I can not but add , that as I am convinced Sir Benjamin is ever delicate in selecting his objects , I feel additional satisfaction at seeing two hundred pounds a-year more , likely to be laid out to the best advantage .
- She curtesyed .


 Oh brave !
damsel , rejoined Mr. Seabrooke , but do you rightly consider how many much finer things might be done with that sum of money , Miss Matilda ?
- but your very name is an encouragement to poetical projects .


No , really , sir  pray instruct me how that is possible , said Matilda ( putting the sugar into Mr. Seabrooke 's cup . )


Why , two hundred pounds per annum , answered Mr. Seabrooke , would enable you ( supposing it to be reserved wholly for fashionable luxuries ) to do a great many genteel and imprudent things , of which you have now , perhaps , no conception .
If it were laid out to advantage , you  might , therewith , do a great deal of mischief .
It would even go a considerable way at the , card-table , and give you the head-ach , or the heart-ach , for a week together .
For ought I know , you might contrive to ruin your complexion ( clear as it is ) for ever , with the sum which you are here going to expend upon a poor fellow with a pair of rusty shoes , and a coat of camblet .
Really , young lady , it is a serious affair , and I would have you think well of it before-hand - I would , indeed .


And now you talk of that , Sir Benjamin ( continued Mr. Seabrooke , after a short pause ) I can not but think you are engaged here in a very singular piece of business .
Why ,  my good sir , do you maturely reflect into what innumerable channels this ocean of money you have exhausted on brick , mortar , and men , who are no way allied to you - do you , I say , consider , how such riches might have , as it were , deluged every dishonest sense about you , in that pleasure which is so much the general pursuit ?
Instead of you ample range of houses , which rob Sorrow of her destined prey , and the real scoundrels of the earth of their ridicule , might you not have built up stabling for the finest steeds that ever were seen  and might you not have had the satisfaction of inviting the world to see your fine horses , instead of your poor men and women ?
Instead of erecting a Church , could you not , at  less expence , have built a Seraglio , and peopled it with destitute beauty , and defrauded innocence , in the manner of many persons of fortune ?
Instead of giving away such loads of wealth , might you not have put in for the chance of doubling it at the hazard table  and even if you should perceive the die go against you , is it not a sort of exit made popular by the practice of modern men of spirit , to retire from the gaming-table in elegant disorder , and very philosophically shoot yourself through the head ?
Instead of providing for the subsistence of such a pack of poor wretches , as , in the wise opinion of the world , have no right to the appetites or passions of nature , could you not with the solid  cash , or as the miser calls it more emphatically , with ` the good hard money ' so expended , have made a river of claret , and swam in all the voluptuousness of the most expensive drunkenness ?
In fine , might you not have been the most gainful usurer , or any other celebrated character much coveted amongst men , had you acted in a prudential way ?
Instead of which , you have nothing to show for forty or fifty thousand pounds , but a large handsome village , which does not bring you in one shilling of `` good hard money , '' a few tears and smiles from poor souls who have nothing else to give you  a private pleasure which pleases your conscience , without filling your purse  and the expectation of a something  yonder ( here he pointed to heaven ) which is of so little weight in the estimation of other people , that they would not lend a single guinea upon such security .
No , Sir Benjamin , you may go on as you please , but if you can not answer this conduct to yourself , I do not know who you will find amongst your friends that will step forth in your behalf .
They will be afraid , sir , to say any thing in excuse , lest the same singularity should be expected on their part .


The fine ironical tone which attended this speech , led us immediately into the oblique compliment it conveyed  and Mr. Seabrooke had , herein , so developed his own character ,  that all further description of him is unnecessary .
I take it for granted , the reader hath a very favourable idea of him , and would wish a more intimate acquaintance .
It is most likely he will not be disappointed .


Suffice it to say , at present , that , after a great deal of persuasion , both from Matilda and me , he agreed to live in the mansion-house in a familyway , but still insisted that I should save nothing  for , though I might stop something for board , he said , he was resolved to have the rest of his pension like another pensioner .


As look and manner is not very accurately put into written language , I can not well tell you how this last  observation occasioned a sincere smile .
I just remark , that Mr. Seabrooke is a man with whom it is impossible to be offended .

THE PENSIONERS ARE NOT PERFECTLY HAPPY IN SHENSTONE-GREEN .


IN process of a little time , the inhabitants of Shenstone-Green began to be weary of looking on the same objects .
They had examined the woods , the walks , the fields , and the flowers , till all these became tiresome .
The praise of their patron , Sir Benjamin , indeed , was still echoed from lip to lip , but somewhat more faintly than at first .
At length , they found  so few charms in vegetable nature and still life , that they cast about for new sources of entertainment .
The first symptom of inquietude which I perceived , was by means of the following letter that was put into my hands by the steward , to whom it was directed at the lodge .


To Mr. SAMUEL SARCASM , at STEWARD 'S - LODGE , on SHENSTONE-GREEN .


Mr. SAMUEL SARCASM ,


WE , the four under-written gentlemen , beg of you to represent the following sentiments to our worthy patron  namely , to tell him , that we have all our lives been remarkably fond of the sports of the field , and the glories of the  chace  and , although we were once beat hollow , yet , by a new management , are sure of our sides for the time to come .
What we would , therefore , propose , is , to introduce a little snug stud of running-horses , rather for the occasional amusement of the company , than for any more lucrative view .
We find , upon examination , that the turf of Shenstone-Green is remarkably fine for the horses feet  and , upon measuring the whole circle within the houses , it appears , that it would make a mighty pretty mile and a half heat .
With leave then of our patron ( against whose consent we would by no means set up even this most manly exercise ) , we propose  fixing up a starting-post , a booth , c. upon the Green , and to have our monthly matches .
This will be attended , Mr. Sarcasm , with no charge to Sir Benjamin , unless he chooses to encourage the institution so far as to give his purse of twenty guineas , more or less , to be run for by four year olds  which , might be a bountymoney in the capacity of patron of the course .
With regard to horses , we flatter ourselves , that few men in Europe have bred better blooded things  and if we have been usually distanced , it hath always been on account of bad jockeyship , and not for wanting skill in horse-flesh .
We do not doubt bringing as fine a show of  cattle in a few weeks , as ever were seen  and as to the times of running , c. we will consider about that .
Meantime , are


`` MR. SAMUEL SARCASM 'S `` Humble servants ,


Alexander Spur .
`` Simon Slapdash .
`` Christopher Cutcord .
`` William Whipwell .
This proposal was instantly laid before Mr. Seabrooke , who set up a long whistle , and said , he had a great mind to laugh at human nature .


For my part , sir , said the steward , I think one has more reason to cry at human nature than to laugh , for  I never yet found her four and twenty hours in the same mind in my life .


But what is to be done , my dear Seabrooke ?
said I , - what is to be done ?


Whew - cried this singular man , catching up his hat and stick , and walking off - Whew .


Lord , papa , said Matilda , I can not see any harm in the gentlemen 's amusing themselves with a few horses  besides which , it will be so charming to have Shenstone-Green Races .
It will be such an amusement for all the ladies and gentlemen , who may see the whole course from beginning to end .
Then it will bring such a  world of good company .
Who will not go to Shenstone-Green Races ?
Oh , heavens !
I like the idea of all things .
Pray , papa , say yes .
Let us have a race by all manner of means .


Well , well , my dear , said I , go and join Mr. Seabrooke ( who , I perceive , is whistling away in the court ) , and I shall consider of it .
When I had the steward alone , I shut the door , and seizing him by the hand , spoke thus : My old friend , I do not well know why , but I tremble upon this subject .
These four gentlemen are , I fear , going to introduce upon us a dangerous entertainment .
- Pray what are their particular circumstances  that is , how are they situated ?


 On my private pensioners-list , sir , they cut rather a queer figure of four .
Let me see - I have the catalogue about me , I think - Aye  here they are .
They come under the letter J - jockies - jockies , where are you - Oh , here we have them .


SPUR - Alexander .
Beat out of New-market eight times - a goodnatured man , very honest  but , a lover of the sport .


SLAP-DASH - Simon .
A good son and a tender husband ( while horses are kept out of his sight ) would merit the pension , if he were not to meet on the Green any gentlemen sportsmen .


 CUTCORD - Christopher .
Thought to be as knowing a one as ever was - taken in .
In other respects , a harmless gentleman .
Is said to be the best shot , also , in England .
Made a point of shoeing his own horses , and always rode himself .


WHIPWELL - William .
Is so broken to the bit , that when he had ruined himself , and , literally , RUN himself into jail , he had the bridle and saddle of his bay colt , Zephyr , imprisoned to keep him company .
Otherwise , just , generous , and even moral .


Oh Samuel !
Samuel !
said I , at the bottom of this account , what is to be done ?


 It does not admit of a question , sir - I wish it did .


What do you mean , Samuel ?


I mean , sir , that if you think proper to set beggars on borseback , they will ride to the Devil .
I know , a n't please your Honour , both man and beast .


But the peril of this project , Samuel ?


We have only to guard against the effects , sir .
You had better submit , with a good grace , to what you have no power to prevent .


But one might expostulate , Samuel , in a tender manner , obliquely , delicately , like a friend .


 What , sir , expostulate with four young fellows , whose blood is now galloping through every vein of their bodies , and newly put into possession of two hundred pounds a-year for life !
- sir , it would be atrocious .


I would not wish any coercive power to remain with me  but , surely , Samuel , if I were to submit my apprehension of consequences to their judgements .


The judgement of a set of jockies , sir - your honour makes me smile .


Well , then , Samuel , you shall carry them my answer to-morrow .


It is enough , answered Samuel .

CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF SHENSTONE-GREEN RACES .


 SHENSTONE-GREEN RACES !
said I , when I found myself alone - it has an ugly sound .
I could have wished , that - but - no matter .
One must expect men will have some amusements  and , indeed , on second thoughts , if they had not , how could they dispose of their annuity , or of what service would it be to them ?


These reflexions determined me to send my reply without delay .
Subjoined , reader , you have a correct copy :


 To Messieurs SPUR , SLAPDASH , CUTCORD and WHIPWELL , Esquires .


GENTLEMEN ,


IF I hesitated a single moment to answer the letter with which you have honoured me , it was upon the most delicate and disinterested principle .
At the time I invited you to favour me with your company at Shenstone-Green , it was , be assured , with no wish to enslave , but to increase your liberty , and to insure to you that independence which is so suitable to man 's spirit .
Every thing , therefore , which increases your happiness , can not but increase mine  because I am persuaded , that all your joys will correspond correctly with the simplicity  and innocence of Shenstone-Green .
Thus , although the common consequences of running-horses are not quite eligible , yet , I trust , you will contrive to render them a pleasing relaxation to yourselves and to others .
In this light it is , solely , that I see your proposal .
To object to it , therefore , had I the power , which I have not , would be exercising too scrupulous a caution .
There are few pastimes fatal , but when they are excessive - yours will , I trust , be agreeable to the law of moderation .
I have the honour to be ,


GENTLEMEN , Your most obliged And obedient servant , B. BEAUCHAMP .


Mansion-house .
 Just as I was sealing this letter , Matilda and Mr. Seabrooke returned , and the former was made happy for the night , on hearing there would speedily be races on Shenstone-Green .

SHENSTONE-GREEN RACES CONTINUED .


 A FEW days after this permission was given , I happened to be crossing The Green , where I perceived these four worthy gentlemen of the whip in close consultation  the subject of which was , whether the starting-post should be fixed on the east or the west side , or whether the ladies booth , or gentlemen 's , should be first erected .
One said , as the houses were in a circle that commanded the course , booths of any sort were unnecessary .


I can see from my dining-room window every inch of ground , said Mr. Spur .


 I will hold you five to four of that , answered Mr. Cutcord .


And I will go your halves , said Mr. Whipwell .


Double it , and say done , cried Mr. Slapdash .


I left them to settle this interesting dispute , and walked on .


Ah SHENSTONE !
said I softly , this is but a bad beginning .
The figure of my friend being full in the centre , I went up to it , and was almost petrified to see the very Founder of the feast plaistered all over with printed advertisements .
On examining these more narrowly , I found a formal annunciation of matters intended by the jockey-party , who had stuck and  billed my beloved Shenstone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot .
One of the advertisements ran thus : SHENSTONE-GREEN RACES .


MONDAY , May the 1st , the Patron 's plate of twenty guineas will be run for by six year olds .
( They took this purse for granted . )


A sweepstakes of a hundred guineas .


A private match for fifty pounds .


And several other by-strokes .


The horses , intended to start on the first day , are Mr. Spur 's Shenstone .


Mr. Cutcord 's chesnut gelding , Annuity  got by Orpheus , who came  out of Eurydice , who was got by Pyrrhus .


Mr. Slapdash 's bay filly Rent-free , who came of Good-nature , who was from that famous horse Liberal .


Mr. Whipwell 's grey colt Beauchamp .


I went home very much mortified at having seen the sacred marble of my friend polluted , and was just going to express my displeasure , when a servant brought me a card and said it waited an answer .
I both read and replied to it almo [ ... ] in the same instant .


CARD .


Messrs. Spur , Whipwell , Cutcord , and Slapdash present their affectionate  compliments to their best friend , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp - inform him they have great reason to hope he will approve the measures they have taken with regard to the approaching races , as they have testified their respect to Sir Benjamin even in the names of the horses , one having the honour to be called Shenstone , the second Annuity , the third Rentfree , and the fourth Beauchamp .


They will continue to show every instance of their heart-felt gratitude on the most trifling occasions , as well as on the present which is important .


ANSWER .


Sir Benjamin Beauchamp is ever flattered by the kind attentions of the  gentlemen who have now so particularly distinguished him  but begs it as a favour , that the figure of Mr. Shenstone , in the centre of the Village , may be considered as the image of a friend whose generous ideas were the hasis of the Green , and whose very statue , therefore , Sir Benjamin can not bear to see disguised or disfigured .


In an hour after this was sent off , I understood by Mr. Seabrooke , that ample justice had been done by the jockies to Shenstone 's statue , which was not only cleared of its incumbrances , but washed and rubbed into the bargain .


I walked out to see the alteration , and felt my heart so elated , that I told Mr. Seabrooke I could not but  consider this sudden reverence to our poetical friend 's pedestal , as a good symptom .
It is respectful , Mr. Seabrooke , said I .


I like it , said Mr. Seabrooke : I like it .

MR. HENRY HEWIT HAS A BAD PEN AND A FINE HEART .


 BUT the adoption of errour is easy and imperceptible : and the races were not run before poor Sarcasm , who was obliged to wade through all the slavery of his office , came charged with other petitions .


A little matter from half a dozen of your honest tradesmen , sir , said Samuel , as he came into the room , where were seated Mr. Seabrooke and Matilda .


Let us see , Samuel : Pray is it good or bad news ?


It is human infirmity , sir .


 Then I must pity it , said Seabrooke , and whistle .


Ihheartily pity it too , said Matilda .


The paper being laid open , presented to me the subsequent composition , of which I shall not even alter the orthography .


To HIS HONORABLE WURTHYNUSS Sir B. BEECHUMPE , A BARROW KNIGHT .


Your honorable wurthyness is desired to hear six of your loyal tradesmen .
Who finds that you haven been so honorible as to instatutes rases : a thing which all the wurld must like who purtends to taust .
On which accounte we , who signe this , want to make it a  finished affair .
Seeing that rases are going for to be run , we beg your honorableness will give us leaf to fite cocks , an amussmunt we have long likked .
We would make our cockpit on the Green , and know where we can have gingers , redbreasts .
and yellow-leggs which will fite till they die .
Not a runner in any of the whole penns .


I had not time to read the names of the people concerned in this letter , before Matilda cried out , Gracious god , is it possible !
and just as she had uttered that exclamation , in came a man in a violent hurry whom the reader will recollect as a pensioner under the name of Henry Hewit .


Sir , sir , Sir Benjamin , said Henry , quite out of breath , I have  heard of another plot against your honour , but it wo n't take  I 'll be your friend yet  I am Henry Hewit .


What 's the matter , Henry ?


The cocks , sir , and the cockfighters .
If you let such a bloody piece of business as that come upon your Green , you may look for murder and all manner of sins after .
Here I am , sir , that never killed a creature , to my knowledge , in the way of sport , in my life .
And if I do but catch a spider ( which I hate more than any thing else ) I break his web to pieces , only to save him from doing his mischief , for his web , sir , is his net , and there it is he hampers his prey .
No , sir , do n't , pray do n't  let cockfighters come amongst us .
Tell the folks , they may have cricket or fives .
If a child of mine was to love cockfighting - I - I - I do n't know what I should do to him - I - I - I verily think I should not bear the sight of him again for ten minutes .
Let me beg of you , sir , to consider of it .


Whew - said Mr. Seabrooke , rising up out of his chair , the world , which the boy Alexander won , ought to be given to that man .
He would make it happy .


Mr. Henry , said Matilda , you are always giving me a pain in the head , I think .
I protest I have such a stroke here that I must take the air a little .


 Better the head ache than the heart ache , Miss Matilda  and God knows you 'd think of me if you were to see the poor dears go to mangle and murder themselves for nothing .


Insufferable - insufferable , the fellow 's insufferable , said Mr. Seabrooke .
I must follow Matilda .


When the wind is in this corner , I have always weak eyes , cried Samuel Sarcasm , blowing his nose .


Then do n't go to the cockfighting , Master Sarcasm , rejoined Hewit , for that will make 'em worse , I promise thee .


Whew - cried Seabrooke , running out of the room .


Well .
sir , added Henry , what may I say !


 Alas !
honest Hewit , said I , at the time of providing a town , I did not provide against the follies nor the vices of its inhabitants , whom , indeed , I took care to have such as were least subject , in my opinion , to either vice or folly .


Then , sir , I am sorry for it , and will take care to be out of the way when the fighting bouts come on .
Your Honour 's humble servant .


He went away .


But you have yet some authority over your tradesmen , sir , said the good steward , and , I think , might take upon you to forbid a thing of this nature .
Suppose we go down together to the tradesmen 's - corner and argue the point personally .
Cock-fighting ,  sir , is really atrocious : the idea hath made me sick .


Pleased with the proposal , we set off for Tradesmen 's - corner , where a croud was just at that instant collected , to see a pitched battle between a Shenstone-Green butcher and a Shenstone-Green baker .
The blows that rebounded on their naked bodies were heard at a considerable distance , and the cries of strike him , strike him , at him Tom , at him Dick , echoed from men , women , and children , who all seemed to be highly delighted with the entertainment .


Sarcasm prudently stopped short , and asked me , if I did not think we might find a less bloody opportunity for an humane business ?


 O Samuel , said I , it in is vain to forbid those to fight cocks , who have a passion for slaughtering one another .


The sooner we go home to bed , sir , the better , said Samuel .
Let us shut our eyes for a few hours - against the species .

XXIX .
A VERY BLOODY CHAPTER , AND A VERY HARD CRUST FOR THE PROPRIETOR OF SHENSTONE-GREEN .


 IN due time , reader , the races were run , and the cocks were fought .
Would to heaven the worst misfortune attending these amusements had been the disfiguration of the beautiful grass-plats of Shenstone-Green , and throwing idly into the air a large sum of money !
This , however , was but a part : For the days of the race and of the cock-fight were distinguished by many other more memorable circumstances .
The bills of both the diversions being assiduously distributed , we had an inundation of  strangers pouring in from all quarters , under pretence of seeing Shenstone-Sports .
Amongst others , came padding into our territory , some of those shameless women who always attend every dissipated exhibition  and I absolutely heard a hawker , crying out , while he was running through the ranks between the heats , ' A List of the Sporting Ladies , Gentlemen .
A true List of the Sporting Ladies on Shenstone-Green . '


Turning , with rapid indignation , from this unforeseen misfortune , I went to another part of the race ground , and came full in the face of an outrage still more fatal .
Exalted above the heads of the people were a mountebank and his men exerting all the ruinous chicane of their itineracy .
 The chief of these vagabonds harangued the multitude on the inestimable virtues of his universal nostrum , and I could see plainly his eloquence was but too palatable .
Many bottles of a precious drop , and many boxes of an invaluable powder , were bought of these empericks then , which are lying in the bones of the silly purchasers at this moment .


Seabrooke set up a whistle on seeing the quacks , and , jumping up on the scaffold , offered to buy their whole stock in trade .


That will be impossible , sir , replied one of the fellows , for any man in this or in a much richer nation to compass .
For I have phials , that  scarce hold a thimble full of liquid , which are worth a world each .
- Buy our stock in trade , indeed !


Could I have bought them , said Mr. Seabrooke to me in a whisper , I would certainly have chucked the whole purchase into one of the basons of water  and , by poisoning all your fish , Benjamin , convince the people what they were at .
After which , the vender might have been led out of The Green victoriously by the nose .
As it is , my friend , added he , you must not be surprized that the serpents creep out in the sun-shine of Shenstone-Green .
It is a fine basking place for them to - cast their skins .


Bending my course forward , I came at last to the cock-pit , where  two animals were at that moment engaged in all the ardour of natural animosity .
I had scarce time to reflect how it was possible for rational beings to find any pleasure in bringing creatures together to kill or be killed , when the exclamations of , six to two on the Sable , and forty to four on the Ginger , drove me from the scene of horrour .
But the violence of the shout still pursued me  and I heard , distinctly , that Ginger was struck through the brain , and Sable came off conqueror , with only the loss of an eye .


But , by this time , the grand running match , which was to finish the evening , came on .
I looked round the circle of houses , and beheld  every window stuck full with caps and curiosity .
Dogs , men , women , and children , were driven from the course , and all was clear within the ropes .
Shenstone-Green breathed expectation .
Every heart panted , every eye was open .
In about a quarter of an hour , four horses were led along The Green by four boys , who were followed by four men .
These were Messieurs Spur , Slapdash , Cutcord and Whipwell  but he who had seen these gentlemen a fortnight before , must have looked very steadily to recognize them .
Besides that they were totally altered in point of dress , they were totally altered likewise in point of bodily dimensions .
Perhaps there never was naturally , four human beings whose size so  little resembled each other  and yet they appeared now brought to the same standard , yea , to the delicacy of half a dram weight .
The truth is , Mr. Slapdash and Mr. Spur ( who were both brawny ) had been some time reducing themselves to match Messieurs Cutcord and Whipwell , who were , happily , as much like skeletons and scarecrows as they ought to be .
But how such a corporeal reduction could have been performed upon the carcase of Slapdash is to this moment a mystery .
Surely , reader , it will be such to thee , when thou art told , that Mr. Slapdash was one of those squabby men whose necks are of the same breadth with the shoulders .
His cheeks were inflated with solid fat ,  and his belly held forth that bursting plenitude which is so remarkably apt to collect in a British subject .
But Mr. Slapdash had , it seems , made his very person the object of a wager  and there were very consisiderable betts depending on his success or miscarriage .
In a point of such importance , Mr. Slapdash , willing to increase his fame , by diminishing his flesh , shut himself up in a dark room , on the fifteenth of April , and sweated himself near dissolution .
None but the persons who had laid on his side of the question were permitted to see him  and some of these ( fearing his flesh would too obstinately cling to his bones ) played upon him several little tricks , that might tend to his diminution .
At one time  they contrived , just when the sweating draught was operating , to introduce into his room a large cat shod with walnut-shells  at another , one of the wags assumed the shape of a spectre in a white sheet , and clanged a chain in the dead of night at his bed side .
At other times , they envelloped him head over heels in so many blankets , that he could scarce breathe under them .
By such kind of sudorifics he had the good luck , at last , to melt down all that superfluous health and force which stood betwixt him and glory  and to the dismay of those who had betted on the continuity of his corpulence , he came out of his flannels , on the first of May , as meagre and as miserable a looking mortal , as ever disgraced  that noble animal which he was to bestride .


As you , my good reader , did not see the exact copy of the last bill , which described the several dresses of the gentlemen-jockies , I shall just acquaint you , that Mr. Cutcord 's jacket was blue  Mr. Whipwell 's , yellow and white  Mr. Spur 's , crimson  and Mr. Slapdashes , morone .
They walked their steeds to the starting-post  they were separately weighed in the scales , and set off .
What a thrilling moment !


I looked with all my might for the pleasure which is said to lie full in the view , when four men on horseback are resolved to outstrip one another in speed , as much and as far as  possible .
I am almost afraid , lest I should ruin the credit of my book with all jockies , should I confess , ( which , were I not persuaded those gentlemen never read , I should not venture ) that I could not work myself up to one poor sensation of satisfaction .
The whole appeared to me so perfectly a matter of the same consequence , that I did not care one farthing about it .
To be the first I could not think any honour , and to be last I could not imagine any shame .
I asked Mr. Seabrooke 's opinion of this .
Have you any warm feelings , my good friend ?


Whew - answered Mr. Seabrooke , wheeling away to another part of the ground .
- Feelings - Whew .
-


 Not so the spectators .
No sooner did the jockies come to the pushing-place , than the confusion of the chace began  and , as the horses approached that part of the course where the grand trials were to be made , where the whip was to be cut into the flank , and the spur dug into the side , the loudest acclamations of passion and of pleasure reechoed to the shore .
What that could agonize my heart did I not hear !
fifty guineas to five ( cried one ) on the Crimson .
An hundred to a China orange on the blue .
Morone against the field , said a third .
Shillings against guineas to any amount that yellow is distanced , hollowed a fourth .
My pension against yours , sir , cried two others ,  who were clattering their sticks and clapping their hands , what say you ?
My pension to yours ?
Say done if you dare .


Done , sir , done , answered the other .


In the midst of this uproar came up to me , in a violent hurry , Mr. Edward Elixir , who was so pleased and so vexed , that he had alternately laughed and cried during the whole course  but there is no staying long in one place to-day , sir , said he , and away he bounded from side to side as rapid as a roebuck .


Mr. Seabrooke busied himself in driving off a parcel of brats who had taken possession of Shenstone 's - statue ,  from the top of whose pedestal they had , it seems , a full view of the sport .
I incontinently begged pardon , sir , said Seabrooke , of the figure  and talked to it on the ungentle doings of the day , as if it had life .


But the honours of the course were much divided , and much obstructed .
In turning a difficult corner , Beauchamp ran butt against Shenstone , and had well-nigh foundered the former  after that , Beauchamp , having too much rein , ran on the wrong side the post , and stumbled on the fetlocks of Annuity , which Rent-free perceiving , whipped up and was scouring away on the stretch of victory ( which he would certainly  have gained ) had not Annuity that moment got upon his legs , passed Rent-free like lightning , and carried off the prize .
Shenstone was brought in , dead lame  and Beauchamp was beat hollow .

THE PROPRIETOR EXERTS HIMSELF  AND IS SO MUCH INSULTED , THAT HE PUTS AN END TO THE CHAPTER ABRUPTLY .


 I RETIRED from the course in some confusion , and secretly resolved to attempt some preventative against the further increase of these disorders .
In the mean time , the night was passed by the Shenstonians in riot and revelry , in the fury of planning new follies , and in the triumph of relating the past .
Upon surveying the scene the next morning , it is difficult to describe the appearance of a change so perfect .
The soft carpet of verdure that before  covered the plain , was torn into raggedness by the trampling of beasts and the bustlings of men .
The tender vegetable fences , which before separated one man 's portion from that of a neighbour , were gapped and broken .
The flowers lay scattered about their beds in fragments , and the whole scene was disemparadised .
As I cast my eye forlornly over the prospect , it brought to my mind these verses of Milton .


Thus began Outrage from lifeless things  but Discord , first , Daughter of Sin , amongst th ' irrational , Death introduc'd , through fierce Antipathy  BEAST now with BEAST gan war , and FOWL WITH FOWL .
But my anger increased as I continued to view the ravages  and in  order to check such violent amusements for the time to come , I immediate issued forth the following edict :


' WHEREAS it was no part of the author 's intention in building Shenstone-Green , and cultivating the land about it , to destroy its beauty in the very first summer , by the introduction of cruel entertainments  I do hereby intreat , that , for the future , all such entertainments ( if they are carried on at all ) be out of the precincts of the said Shenstone-Green , which is already so much damaged , that it will require time before it can be brought to its former state of rural elegance .


BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP .


'  This notice was no sooner gone abroad , than it produced very different consequences .
First came a card , written by the parson of my village .


CARD I .


THE Reverend Mr. Cushion presents his most respectful compliments to his worthy patron , Sir B. Beauchamp  and , in the name of a very amiable body of the pensioners , male as well as female , returns him sincere thanks for his active endeavours to banish from The Green an amusement so perilous and so unchristian .
They consider the gardens and the morals equally concerned in this inhibition , and hope it will tend to recreate order and regularity in the  noblest society that ever was instituted .


Parsonage-Place .


The pleasure I felt on the receipt of this note was great  but it was effaced by the next .


CARD II .


Your Proclamation , Sir Benjamin , was pleasant  it had all the air of majesty about it .
As to amusements , they depend upon taste .
If we have hurt the flowers , we are willing to pay for them amongst us three ( for Mr. Whipwell , who rode Beauchamp , has run from The Green ) .
However , as loyal subjects , you may depend on it , we shall , as in duty bound , readily obey any commands  you are graciously pleased to impose on

THE SPORTS OF FALSE DELICACY .


 IT was by setting the politeness of the one against the rudeness of the other , that I was able to strike the balance without any considerable depression of spirits .
We must always agree to a compromise between good and evil fortune .
If , said I , weighing two circumstances , a few unruly and uncultured characters rise up against the very shadow of government , there are other minds so much better disposed , that pain and pleasure are at least equipoised .
Nay , the latter is , in the present case predominant : For who will compare five or six cockfighters and jockies , who have  returned to their old infirmities , to upwards of thirty regular persons whose gratitude is ever warm , and whose love of order will continue to increase the felicity of our society ?
Perhaps my last injunctions might , after all , be carrying my wishes beyond my power .
I may , perhaps , have stepped over the decent limits of that sacred law which every man should tremble to violate while he is conferring a benefit .
The rights of hospitality are so extremely delicate , that while distress or poverty is under its protection , the greatest caution should be exerted .
For the future I am determined to be more circumspect .


At the conclusion of this soliloquy in came Matilda , introducing to me a  female friend and a young pensioner .
I pretended to receive them as new faces , or , at least , such as I had only transiently seen at the time of their initiation .
But , in reality , they were that very Sidney and Eliza whose peculiar passion for each other hath been already delineated .


Mr. Seabrooke was not at home .
He was hunting May-ladies in the wood .


Amongst many intricate scenes which I have seen pass in the company of four people , that which was in this interview acted by our extraordinary lovers , was not the least .


I , who was in the secret , soon found out that there was a double plot  to be sustained , for Mr. Sidney was to pass as a casual acquaintance , and Eliza was not to betray the least traits of her affection even to her friend Matilda .
Let us see how this was performed .
Nature hath not often assumed a more delicate disguise .


In compliment , perhaps , to me , the conversation turned - notwithstanding we were then at the tea-table - upon the pleasures of pure benevolence  and upon Shenstone-Green .


It warms the heart in such a manner , said Eliza : It so anticipates the elysium we are to expect hereafter - It brings so much of heaven down upon earth - Then it gives such opportunities of bringing old friends together .
( Here she glanced her eye towards Sidney . )


 Madam , said Sidney - a little disconcerted - is there any thing amiss about my person that you are pleased to honour it with so particular an attention ?


No !
said Eliza ( rather blushing ) .


Is your tea made to your liking , dear Eliza ?
said Matilda .


Perfectly , replied Eliza ( willing to turn the conversation by adverting to trifles ) , I lately take a great deal of sugar .


Indeed , cried Sidney , you are much changed then  for I remember - formerly -


What do you remember , Mr. Sidney ?
said Eliza ( interrupting him for  fear he should finish his blunder ) What do you remember ?


I think , said I , ( willing to give a good-natured lift ) we are quite still after the hurry of our last week 's amusements .


Amusements !
do you call them , Sir Benjamin ?
said Eliza .
If I had any of my family who could encourage  or , if there was any person whom I respected that did not reverence you , sir , for the manner in which you expressed your displeasure on that occasion , I should hate him .


As I hope to be saved ( exclaimed Mr. Sidney with uncommon earnestness ) I could never bear the idea , Eliza .
You know it .


 You , Mr. Sidney - what right had I to suppose - that you , Mr. Sidney .
-


It was the gentleman 's humanity that gave him so much emotion , madam , said I , and I am persuaded , he will rather be applauded than censured , for the exertion of such a virtue by Miss Elliot .


But Mr. Sidney 's virtues , sir , are always so much of the violent kind , answered the lady .


Always , madam , said the gentleman ?


How can Mr. Seabrooke , possibly be in that filthy wood , said Matilda , when he might be so much more agreeably engaged .


Filthy wood , Miss Beauchamp , cried Sidney - silthy wood , do you  call it .
- Oh !
my God !
Eliza , I believe , will not subscribe to the propriety of that epithet !
Filthy wood !


Why should you suppose so , Mr. Sidney , said Eliza .
I see nothing very remarkable that - that .
-


Not remarkable - Oh !
Miss Elliot - how you talk !
- Was it not in that blessed wood .
-


Blessed wood , Mr. Sidney !
-


That - that the birds , and - and -


Pray Mr. Sidney , said I , do you not think the walks are tolerably laid out , and the benches well fixed upon the whole ?


Admirably sir , replied Sidney  but we shall know more of it to night , for -


 Mr. Sidney , said Eliza .
Mr. Sidney !


For I intend to walk in it .
- Sir Benjamin , that 's all .


What , alone , said Matilda ?


Unless , madam , Sir Beauchamp would permit me the honour - the honour -


Hem - hem , coughed Eliza with all her force .
The honour of - of your .
- The poor fellow had got into a mistake , of which he could by no means clear himself .


No , said I , touching Matilda gently on the cheek  my little friend here , seldom goes out of an evening .


Mr. Seabrooke and I , are to play at chess , papa - answered Matilda , smiling .


 The eyes of Eliza were lighted up in a moment .
Sidney seemed as if a load was taken from his heart  and in a few minutes , after Sidney had formally invited Eliza to honour him with her hand home , the visitors departed .


No sooner were they gone , than Matilda observed , with great simplicity , that Mr. Sidney was a mighty pretty man , if he had not got such a trick of stammering  and that , as to Eliza , she said , she never saw her in such a peevish temper before .


Mr. Seabrooke now coming in , I pretended some business on the Green , and left them together .

THE SAME SUBJECT .


 I WENT immediately to the wood , where , after hunting through many mazes , and stopping to listen at every five paces , I both heard and saw the persons I sought .
I had an opportunity to conceal myself behind a cluster of elms , where , I could so shift about as occasion might require , that , had the sun , instead of the moon , been shining , I might have carried on my little stratagem undiscovered .
To this manoeuvre , it is reader , that I am able to give you the following dialogue .


 SIDNEY .
It does not signify talking , Miss Elliot , you have fairly betrayed it .
ELIZA .
No , sir , it is through your means that Sir Benjamin and his daughter know the whole matter .
SIDNEY .
The delicacy of my passion , Miss Elliot , is - ELIZA .
Neither prudent nor consistent , sir .
Had your passion been truly delicate - SIDNEY .
Had it been .
Heavens , madam , am I doubted .
ELIZA .
Mr. Sidney , Mr. Sidney , you have done very ill : We shall be the talk or  Shenstone-Green .
Our passion will be as public - SIDNEY .
As Eliza has made it .
Sir Benjamin has a right to laugh at the hobble - the hobble which - ELIZA .
You have brought yourself into .
- It would have been some consolation indeed , had our affection been discovered properly .
But as you think we have both bungled - SIDNEY .
No , madam  not both , my heart dictated every word .
ELIZA .
Sir , my tenderness was to the full as apparent as yours .
SIDNEY .
Mine , madam , betrayed itself in every trifle  our patron saw it as plain -  ELIZA .
Not to see mine , sir , would argue blindness and want of understanding .
When I talked of old friends being brought together , I looked at you in such a manner , that it would be impossible to mistake my meaning .
SIDNEY .
My tenderness , Miss Elliot , was still more conspicuous in the way that I took notice of yours .
ELIZA .
But I have better demonstrations , sir .
Think about the affair of the wood .
SIDNEY .
In that madam , I exposed my passion infinitely beyond Eliza .
ELIZA .
Tis false , you did not , Mr. Sidney .
 SIDNEY .
I did .
Think too of my embarrassment about the birds .
ELIZA .
Rather remember the delicate confusion of my cough , when you imprudently invited Matilda to walk with you .
SIDNEY .
That completes my victory , Miss Elliot , for in that half-uttered invitation , I laid open my tender soul to the whole view of the company .
ELIZA .
You are a very unjust man , and I have a great mind to submit it to Sir Benjamin himself .
SIDNEY .
Rather , madam , let us part for ever  it is but too clear we shall  never agree .
You never loved me .
ELIZA .
Not love you , Sidney ?
SIDNEY .
Oh !
Heavens what is the matter Eliza !
ELIZA .
Nothing - Mr. Sidney .
SIDNEY .
Your dear eyes are wet - Oh !
heavens , forgive me  forgive me thou best of women !
ELIZA .
Ah !
Sidney - Sidney !
SIDNEY .
This kiss is the seal of our eternal reconciliation - come my best love - the dew falls - you may catch cold - let me conduct you home .
 These two sensitive souls now embraced with the fondest affection , and going home , lingered a few minutes at the door of the lady , and then parted .

HUMAN NATURE SHOWS OFF ON SHENSTONE-GREEN .


 FOR two or three days after my edict about the impropriety of racing and cock [ ... ] ting , the Shenstonians were remarkably tranquil  and I was just on the brink of felicitating myself hereupon , when the steward came to the Mansion-house with a bundle of papers , whose very size threatened an invasion of the peace .


What have you got there , Samuel ?
said I .
As much as I can well carry sir , replied Samuel , laying down his load , and adjusting his grey locks .


 But of what kind Mr. Sarcasm ?


Of poor human nature , a n't please your honour .
She is always ailing sir , and , like a sick man afflicted with a complication , one disorder is no sooner cured than twenty more make their appearance .


While the steward was making this physical remark , he loosened the red tape which was tied round the papers , and presented them to me in the following order .
To begin with trifles , sir , amuse yourself with No. 7 .


No. 7 .
was directed - To the knight of the noble soul , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp .


 MOST BENEVOENT BARON ,


HEARING that you have erected a whole town at your own expence for the good of the public , we , the most unhappy part of it , do humbly address you from our prison-house , his majesty 's Fleet , where , we are at this time confined from the wholesome air , for honest debts .
The persons , who are chiefly concerned in this epistle , are not the poor devils on the common side , who are huddled together for paltry demands , and are reduced to live on the king 's generous allowance of bread and water  but gentlemen , sir , gentlemen who have formerly cut their figure in the fashionable circle  kept it up for several  year together , and made the stones both of London and Paris fly before them .
Not a single man of us but was nabbed for a debt of distinction  five or six hundred pounds the smallest .
But we find our time hang so very dragging , sir , that we have resolved to address your noble soul in our behalf .
Your scheme being to relieve the embarrassed , where will you find men more embarrassed than such as are deprived of their liberty  who had exhausted all credit before they were arrested  and who , consequently , can live in jail only upon the catch ?
Your benevolent buildings therefore upon Mr. Shenstone 's basis - ( by the by , that Shenstone is much obliged to you for bringing him into vogue , for none of us , who sign this letter , ever  heard his name before ) - are the only asylums which can be of any comfort in our situation  because , as we observed above , we had better remain in the Fleet , than be let out without any future provision  and your plan appears to be the only one adopted in the present age , where a gentleman somewhat faded can polish himself up again .
Though our debts amount , collectively , to about ninety thousand pounds  yet we are well convinced , our creditors have such an idea of us , that they will chearfully take sixpence or a shilling in the pound .
So that for a mere trifle , you may make the compromise .
We wait for your reply , on the wrong side of brick walls and iron bars  so no more need be hinted to your  known humanity .
But , as a further argument in our favour , we can not in justice to ourselves , omit showing you , by some proofs , that , we did not come here for any petty , piddling , ungenteel claims .
Annexed , therefore , you will receive a short sketch of our respective actions , none of which , we flatter ourselves , can ever entail disgrace upon men of family , spirit , and


Your most obedient , Humble servants .


 The names of my most obedient humble servants were inclosed in the following


LIST .


SPLITCLOTH against FREDERICK FLASH , Esq. .
FOR cloth furnished and clothes made , as by bill delivered - 700 # .
17s .
7Ωd .


N. B .
This debt was not more than seven months standing , and F. Flash was esteemed the best dressed man in England all that time .
Splitcloth has declared he will take the odd 17s .
and 7dΩ .
and F. Flash to pay original cost of writ , and prison fees .


 PERSIAN against GAYMAN , FOR one thousand pounds worth of mercery , sent by said Gayman 's order , to the lodgings of Miss Snoozle , No. 11 , Bond-street .


N. B. Snoozle set the fashions for three parts of the summer .
The vogue was nothing but Snoozlecaps , Snoozle-hats , Snoozle-hoods and Snoozle-sacks  it was even a fashion to say such or such a thing that had any pretensions to air , was à la Snoozle .
The last time Mr. Gayman saw this lady , was just when Persian 's writ was served upon the said Gayman , at her apartment .


 POLICY against HAZARD .
Mr. Hazard though originally in , at the suit of Policy , a broker , hath twenty-eight detainers , amounting in the whole to a sum not exceeding thirty thousand pounds  and if Sir B. B. does not stand his friend , must lie for life .
Mr. Hazard 's case is particularly hard .
He was the man who , some years ago , rendered himself famous by insuring tickets in the lottery , and bought up as many wholes , as would have made him the richest commoner in England , had his purchases consisted of prizes instead of blanks .
Mr. Hazard is still more to be pitied , in consideration that he , in conjunction with some others , ruined himself by playing at  push-pin one rainy evening , when they nor he had any other intention than to pass the time betwixt tea and supper .
But men of real spirit can never answer for themselves when set in for it .


As I saw the list was made out wholly on the same principle , I did not think it necessary to go on , but , with great marks of amazement in my countenance , asked the steward , if he supposed this letter was sent in the way of waggery or seriousness ?


Bless me , answered Samuel , your honour seems to know but little of things terrestrial .
This is to me atrocious .
Are you to be told , sir , that the passions can make us believe any thing  and while the miser is  priding himself upon the propriety of putting a thousand pounds into his chest , the prodigal thinks he is doing as meritorious an action in throwing double that sum away ?
You and I , sir , ( who are neither miser nor prodigal ) can say this is wrong  but if we were engaged in the schemes , either of amassing or dissipating , we should applaud ourselves as well as the worst of them .


That proves , Samuel , said I , that thou art thyself a little near-sighted .


How doth your honour make that out !
Have not I always said , you were a little bit of a miser , Samuel ?


But your honour knows I would never allow it .
Upon the same principle ,  I have now and then said , since the building of Shenstone-Green that -


I was a prodigal , hey ?


But your honour would never admit it .
In short , sir , the man who commits an errour , and the man who criticizes it , have each of them different words to express the same thing .
What I call profusion , you call generosity  what you call avarice , I call discretion .
So that you may depend on the sincerity of the prisoners in his majesty 's Fleet .
But lay them by as a foreign matter , and let us come nearer your honour .


He now gave me No. 6 .


Why this is going backwards said I .


 No matter , answered the steward , for the order of numbers  I offer them to your honour in the order of importance  beginning with the least atrocious , and so going regularly on to the greater .


Though Samuel said this very coolly , it set me on the tremble .
After the petition of the prisoners , I did not expect the matter to soar higher .
But you shall judge , reader , how far I was mistaken , when you are in the humour to amuse yourself with the next chapter .

THE PENSIONERS ARE POLITE .


 NO. 6 .
was addressed to Mr. Sarcasm .


Pray Mr. Sarcasm signify to our patron , that a very modest family upon the Green , are constantly insulted by one of the pensioners who hath the next house  in which he keeps an infamous madam , within ear-shot of us .
On the first day of the races , we saw her trolloping about the course in a faded silk gown , and a dirty fringed petticoat  on the second day , she appeared in the same dress , walking arm in arm with the above pensioner , and , since that time , she  has been introduced into the man 's house , where she sings and swears in such a manner that we are both shocked , and disturbed .
These two sit up best part of the night  and about twelve o'clock this morning , a very splendid vis a vis , entirely new , and constructed on a French model  made its appearance at madam 's door .
The family who complain of this grievance have no carriage at all  nor do they think it consistent with the modesty they ought to maintain under present circumstances  but , they can not with patience bear to see a vile creature exalted above women of virtue .
To make the matter still worse , there are four more dressed up husseys of this wretch 's acquaintance , who are come down in a phaeton and four horses ,  which are driven by a great gauky masculine she-thing , who gathers up the reins , and smacks the long whip like a stage coachman .
Suggest , therefore , we beg of you Mr. Sarcasm to the most amiable Sir B. Beauchamp , how much the purity of his charming Paradise must suffer by the introduction of these harlots , who will not only ruin all the Shenstonian batchelors , but throw out all their lures to alienate every husband from the arms of his honourable wife .
The extirpation , therefore , of this evil , while it is yet in the bud , is submitted to our patron , whose virtuous heart , will , we are assured , adopt such measures as may most effectually serve the female innocence and fidelity ,  which he hath so kindly taken in charge .


Signed by the above family , and all the other ladies of Shenstone-Green .


This letter made so strong an impression , that I desired Samuel to lay the rest of the papers by , till some other time  for this is an affair , Samuel , said I , which must be taken into immediate consideration .


Sir , replied the steward , the name of the pensioner who has been guilty of the crime in question is Danby  a young gentleman who stands in my book of anecdotes , as the best hearted young man in the world .
The character I have had of him , previous to his being marked for the Green is this ,  `` Danvers Danby , Esq. a person of fine genius , unbounded generosity , tender feelings , lively passions , and adored by the ladies . ''


And is Mr. Danby , said I , the author of such an indelicate action ?


Why your honour should consider that all the qualities which constitute his fine character , lean , as I may say , wholly to spirited things .


Spirited things quotha  do you consider what may be the effect of these spirited things ?
- May I not have a brothel brought upon my Green  and instead of conjugal harmony and continency , may not my dear Shenstone 's system -


 Suppose sir , your honour was to tell the Shenstonians , once for all , a piece of your mind .
I think something might be done yet .


If thou canst advise any thing to give my perplexed head and heart a little ease , pray , good fellow , lose no time : let me know it .
I thought I should both give and receive happiness , but I am horridly mistaken  upon my soul I am , Mr. Sarcasm .


Here this ludicrous Mr. Sarcasm , in whom a dry kind of rigid remark was constitutional , sat down at a desk which stood in the room , and wrote as follows :


 Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP , Bart .
To the LADIES and GENTLEMEN , Pensioners of SHENSTONE-GREEN .


LADIES and GENTLEMEN ,


WHEN I offered you and yours a sanctuary in my village , I meant to assist your distresses , and not to support your passions and natural appetites  which , I imagined , you would be prudent enough to leave behind you , in the several sorry places where I picked you up .
I gave each of you a good house and a good fortune , because , before you had neither of those comforts  but I had no idea that you would plague me with any of the little human weaknesses which so ill  correspond with the purity and paradisaick system I wanted to establish .
It is , therefore , insisted , that , while you are under my patronage , you cast out all improper affections whatsoever , and walk , inoffensively , backwards and forwards , over the Green , between meals  or that you will at least -


Pshaw , Mr. Sarcasm , said I ( peevishly interrupting him ) , do you imagine I am in a temper to be trifled with ?


Scarce had these words passed my lips , before a fine , elegant , splendid , and prepossessing young man came into the room with an air of ingenuous distress .


It was Mr. Danby .
He fell upon his knee .
My dear sir , said he , my  worthy protector , I am this instant informed of the offence I have given to some of the persons in our neighbourhood .
I have done wrong , sir .
- I feel .
- I repent .
Had I reflected but a moment it would have been impossible .
- The woman struck my fancy .
- I am too apt to follow my feelings , and my sensibility is generally wounded too late .


After such language , Mr. Danby , what can I say ?
I am disarmed .


The woman is no longer under my roof , sir .
Upon my honour I have dismissed her .


It is sufficient , Mr. Danby  I hope there will be no further bad consequence .
I see your forgetfulness in the true light , and I do not doubt -


 Matilda , who had been sitting to embroider in the next room , now opened the glass door which looked into the apartment where we were talking , and rushed in with a countenance like the paleness of death .


Mr. Danby 's confusion was visible in every feature : He re-assured me that every thing should be done to my utmost satisfaction , and abruptly withdrew .


I was sensibly alarmed  and desiring the steward to postpone the rest of the business till the next morning , my daughter and I were left together .


She was still labouring with some concealed anxiety , and after fixing her eyes on me very tenderly for some minutes , she fell at my feet , and bathed my hand with her tears .


 Matilda , said I , for God 's sake , consider your poor father .


I am very young , papa  perhaps very foolish  and am now kneeling for my father 's instruction .
- That - that young gentleman who is just gone out , sir - that young gentleman - sir -


Hah !
- go on , Matilda .


Has given me the greatest misery ever since he has been at the Green .


How so , Matilda ?


Do n't be angry with me , dear papa , - but even if you are , I must speak out my whole heart .
I have met him at Miss Elliot 's .
His figure - His conversation - His manner - I am  afraid I love him , sir .
Indeed I am afraid of it .


Love him , did you say , Matilda ?


But he is a libertine - he is a rake .
I have heard his whole story .
- Yet , sir , he confessed his errour - he is not a shameless man - he - Pray , sir , did he not say , the woman who had seduced him was dismissed ?


Ah !
Matilda - you are the dear and darling comfort of my life .
Heaven knows how long this project of happiness , which I have put into execution upon this Green , may be depended on .
The edifice was flattering and fair , but , perhaps , it may not prove solid .
The gust of ingratitude may weaken , and the tempest of contrary passions may destroy it .
It is possible  that this little paradise , which I have raised , like a second Eden , around me , may , like the first , which was regulated by more powerful patronage , be equally lost .
In that case , my Matilda will be the only flower that will remain of all my garden .
Her sweetness and beauty must soothe me in every disappointmeet , and supply the place of the angel who gave her being .
- Alas !
Matilda - I am even jealous of your affections  but I would not keep them all , when your tender heart disposes you to divide them .
Of Mr. Danby we know a little .
His qualities are fine but they are dangerous .
Yet we will enquire .
I will , for your sake , have over him the eye of a father , and if it can possibly be you shall not want -


 Before I could end the sentence she was weeping upon my neck .
- Ah !
my dear papa , said she , but this is not all .
My heart will burst if you are not acquainted with every thing .
I can not support the burden of hypocrisy .


Not all , Matilda !
- In heaven 's name , what do you mean ?
Speak this moment .


He hath been in distress - I myself saw him send all he could command in the world to a poor family to which he hath obligations .
I myself , too , saw the piercing letter , in which the application was made , and - and -


Speak , child .
Conceal nothing .


 As he had not enough to satisfy his heart , or do them the full service he desired - I gave him my little new-year 's purse , and -


What more ?


Borrowed twenty guineas of a friend .


What friend , child ?


Mr. Seabrooke , sir .
- But I did not mention names - Pray do n't hate me - I never concealed any thing before .


Matilda , Matilda , ( said I , taking her in my arms , ) I am not angry  I am both afflicted and rejoiced .
Leave the management of this business to me .
Act as before , and all may be well .
One truth , however , is  clear .
Let us establish what systems or what societies we please , joy and sorrow shall be for ever mixed , and , wheresoever we fix our dwelling , whether , in a great city , or on Shenstone-Green , they will pursue us close , and command alternately our smiles and tears .


Hush !
said Matilda  Mr. Seabrooke is coming to the door .
Not a word of Mr. Danby .

WHICH INTRODUCES AN OLD SOLDIER .


 MR. Seabrooke had no sooner entered , than he presented to me a letter which , he said , he had just before taken from the postman , whom he saw on his return from walking .


To Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP .


SIR ,


I am a lame and deafish man , who was first cut to pieces in his majesty 's service  and after that , being a man of no interest , hopped and begged upon his majesty 's highway .
On hearing of your scheme ,  I thought it might be , now and then , a penny in the way of my distress , to try my luck near Shenstone-Green  for , I naturally thought that , people who were supported themselves by the generous , would be generous to others .
So I made a journey of about six weeks travelling - for you must consider , sir , I go upon a wooden horse - and I am very lately got here , where I walked round and round the Green .
But , alas sir , begging is but a bad business , even in a village which was built up by the hand of charity .
I do not like to complain , because I know the world , and because I would not dishonour my cloth  but , I find this town so much worse for me than any other , that , were  it not for the goodness of two persons , I should move my timber legs out of Shenstone-Green , and trust again to the turnpike road .


One of those persons - God bless him - is Master Henry Hewit , who says , he was once a very poor man himself  the other is one Squire Danby , who says , he knows that old lads like me , who have lost their limbs in a glorious cause , do not choose to take money gratis  so , by way of making me believe that I earn mine , orders me to walk his horse backwards and forwards  then lead him to water , then back to stable , then take off his saddle - for which service , he gives me very often a whole guinea ,  because , he says , he chooses to pay people according to their rank in life  and if I had not fought in the field for my country longer than I could stand , I should not , Mr. Danby says , so often see the picture of the king , my master , whom I have defended , in the best metal .


I write this to tell you , sir , that , if by chance you should see a large tawny looking oldish fellow hopping about the Green , you should not think I am a nuisance  because I am getting rich between my two friends above-mentioned  and when I have saved towards twenty pounds , will set up a bit of a shop , live by  fair commerce , and trouble folks no more .


I am sir , your honoured humble servant to command , HACKNEY OLDBLADE .


P. S. I saw your honour 's steward on the road some time ago , when he was hunting up Misery  but I believe I had not limbs enough for his purpose .


As I knew the delicacy of my poor girl 's affection , I gave her this letter to read when she was at leisure , pretending that it was a matter of no consequence , but might , perhaps , amuse her a little .
I could see the idea of Mr. Danby mount into her eyes as I gave it .


 She put the letter into her pocket , from which moment she was so anxious and uneasy , that she pretended a sudden indisposition as an excuse for retiring early to her chamber .


In less than half an hour , she returned , declaring that her illness was gone , and she never was so well or so happy in her life  though it appeared plainly , by a redness that remained about her eyes , she had been weeping .
What a paradox is pleasure !


The truth is , I was little less affected or less pleased than herself at this new trait we had discovered in young Danby , and I resolved , if possible , to make him every way worthy my Matilda .
I hope reader , she is by this time thy favourite .

HUMAN NATURE LOOKED AT IN AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION .


 PRETTY early the next morning , my daughter was bestirring herself in the pantry  and , just as I came down stairs , had thrown a white napkin over a little wicker basket , which she said , was destined for Master Hackney Oldblade .
Give him this new guinea too , Matilda , said I , and tell him , it is the latest that has been struck of his sovereign .
I send it as a token , that I think him no nuisance upon Shenstone-Green , where he may stay and settle .


 Matilda tripped away with her provisions without waiting to hear more  and just as she was gone , one of Master Oldblade 's friends , Henry Hewit , made his appearance .


Though the conversation which ensued at this interview is very extraordinary , I hope , honest reader , thou hast heart enough to suppose it not so far out of nature as to be impossible .
If I show thee conduct in a poor unlettered peasant , which discovers an excellence in humanity , which thou didst not before suspect belonged thereto  be grateful for the pleasure I shall give thee , and do not say , that is unnatural which may only be uncommon .


Sir , said Henry , pulling off his hat with great reverence , I have been  some days a miserable fellow , and as I look upon your honour to be my father , I want to tell you why and wherefore I am thus wretched .


Henry , speak ?


Your honour has , as I may say , almost killed me with kindness .
Pray do not think me wicked if I say how much happier I was , when ShenstoneGreen was building , than I am now it is finished .
Ever since I had strength in my arms - and you see , sir , I am built almost like a church - I have been used to labour .
I have worked , dear , good sir , till work is my play , and play is my work : yes , your honour , I have found it harder to pass my time since I had nothing to do , than ever it was for me to get-up  and go to bed with the sun .
I will tell your honour why .


Do so , honest Henry .


When I was a labouring man , I knew that I must not eat nor drink till I had done so much for bread and so much for bed .
When that so much was finished , I sat me down to a repast , which was so sweetened by my hunger , that every morsel was a feast .
Then I went hobbling home at night as weary as weary .
So much the better  I made but one sleep of it till daylight , and then got up as gay as a bird to weary myself again .


But your situation , Henry , is much more easy now on Shenstone-Green .


 Too easy , a great deal too easy , sir .
I do not know that the bones are the better for stretching on a velvet cushion .
Had I a good education I might , perhaps , amuse myself with good books or maps , or such things  but , as I can neither read or write , so as to make any pleasure of it , tis but making my head ache to no purpose .
No , sir , here lies the mischief  I am a man worth two hundred a year , and have got my fine house over my head  my old work-clothes are thrown away  I have things upon my back that do not sit at all to my liking .
I am not company for the other pensioners who have most of them spent a good fortune before they came to the Green .
I think they look too as if they laugh at me when I go by any  of them , as they stand idling at their doors .
This conceit hurts my clown 's pride so mortally , that I keep out of their sight as much as I can  and towards the evenings give them the slip out of my back door .
Sometimes I escape to the next parish , where my old fellow-labourers live .
But even there , I do not find myself at home as usual , because they geer and fleer , and are jealous of my good fortune , and say , they can not think what your honour could see in my face to stick me up for a gentleman ?
After this , I am obliged to make them all nearly drunk before they will own me for an old acquaintance .
Besides this , sir , I see your honour 's tradesmen hate me , and think they have one and all a  better right to your bounty than Henry Hewit .


They may think as they please , but I consider Henry Hewit as the best and worthiest man upon Shenstone-Green .


Too good , your honour is too good  for what can I do ?
I have no exercise , and so have no appetite .
I always am feeling for my leather apron .
I sometimes catch up my old trowel and am ready to shed tears over it , as if it were because I had thrown away with it an old friend that used to get me the brown bread that I bought myself , I can not sleep at nights , because I am in a sort of a doze all the day .
In short , sir , I look upon it , that I am living a very wicked life , and  with your honour 's leave , I will mend it .


Is that possible , friend Henry ?


Very possible , sir  as thus : I will return my pension to the dear noble hand out of which I received it : I will live in a little snug house amongst your honour 's tradesmen : I will take care the people shall know my mind , that there may be no envy nor heartburning  and I will , if your honour thinks fit , be master mason and bricklayer of all Shenstone-Green .
For this , your honour may pay me from time to time , but not all at once  so that though I shall return to my own track and to my own trade - which few know better - yet I shall never want either victuals or work  and , to a  poor fellow like me , to want one of these , is to want both .


And are you serious , Henry ?


So serious , and please your honour , that I shall break my heart if you do not oblige me .
But this is not all .
I think I know whom your honour might put into the house and fortune which I shall quit .


I would gladly have a person of my friend Hewit 's recommendation .


Then you must know , sir , there is a fine old creature , mangled all over , who has set his face against our enemies , till his trade is fairly cut from him by the naked sword .
He is a very merry good soul , and when I saw him the other day walking on his  wooden stumps , I said to myself , Oh !
Henry Hewit , Henry Hewit , there is a man who ought to be in thy place !
He is robbed at once of his business and his blood  be an honest lad and go back to thy labour , Henry , and speak a good word for a gentleman-soldier , whose hairs are grey , and whose limbs are gone .
I cried like a child as I said this : but if your Honour agrees to my two proposals , I will do nothing but work and laugh all the rest of my life .


I do agree , Henry , and you shall have it just in your own way .


Then , sir , if you please , I will begin to work to-morrow , for I have been sideling backwards and forwards , and I see there are some repairs wanting  in the brickwork about the Mansionhouse .
The tiling on the left side is loosened , and I have spied out a crack or two in the back chimnies  one leans a little .


What then , Henry , your eyes have been at work already .


Use , you know , sir , is second nature .
I never see a building of any kind if it is of brick , but I can tell what should be done in a trice .
It is in my way .
Lord , your Honour , how happy you have made me !
but the cement will be better if I were to mix my lime over night .
I will go then and temper my mortar - Lord how happy I am - to say the real factotum , I never was so happy in  my life .
I must kiss your Honour 's hand , I must indeed .


Here the poor excellent fellow leaped about with unaffected joy , and was carried away into many extravagant gestures by sensations , which do not frequently , I fear , interrupt the tranquility of human beings .


Just as he was going out , he turned round to desire I would not mention his name in the affair of the hopping soldier , because , said Henry , it will have a better look if your Honour was to say , you had heard of Master Oldblade 's great fighting feats , and made him a pensioner for the sake of your country  that , your Honour knows would please the old fellow  for all your sword-blade gentry  have a sort of pride about them - as to me , you may tell him that I am a good bricklayer and mend a crack , or lay a tile for my country as bravely as any man  but , for the matter of fighting , I am a mere mess of milk , and never killed any thing in my life .
Say I am gone to my old business , and had only Master Oldblade 's house for a time .


To make any comment on this behaviour on the part of our bricklayer , would be to suspect the reader 's sense and sensibility .


I leave it , therefore , with his feelings .

THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE .


 BUT human nature having , in the two last chapters , exibited her bright side , we must now be content to look on the reverse of her picture .


Mr. Samuel Sarcasm , who was ever scrupulously exact to his appointments , appeared with the rest of the papers which remained unexamined .


Now , Samuel , said I , I have time to finish .


He gave me No 5 , which , reader , I make thee a present of with all my heart .


 To Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP , By Favour of S. SARCASM , ESQ. .


OUR DEAR SIR BENJAMIN ,


WE , the female part of your pensioners , who , in the former portion of our lives , were accustomed to enjoy the innocent amusements of the world , find ourselves rather ennuyed , as the French say : for although to walk over the velvet green , or the shady wood , to watch the opening of the flowers and budding of the bushes - though these , and other rural amusements , be exceedingly pleasant in the summer , yet , with long nights , come upon us the desires of re-enjoying the entertainments of the winter .
To provide these , therefore ,  for the cold weather , has been the grand object of our consultations for some days  and we think we have , at length , hit upon a plan of progressive pleasures , which will carry us agreeably through the gloomy months , till groves and gardens again become sufferable .


FIRST , WE are making a purse of a few hundreds , to establish a sweet little epitome of a Pantheon , where we will , though at a small expence , have our vocal gods and goddesses , at least , twice a week .
And we will call it , by way of compliment , Shenstone-Green Pantheon .


SECONDLY , WE , knowing perfectly well , all the arts of surprize and delicate slight , propose also a kind  of Cornelys , where our lights , rooms , and partitions shall shift about at the word of command .
This must be named The Country Cornelys on Shenstone-Green .


THIRDLY , WE earnestly intreat your assistance in erecting a building for Theatrical works , to be written by ourselves and our husbands , and to be acted by one another .
Though this scheme will certainly be attended with some expence , yet it will be such an encouragement to genius , as will raise up in the pensioners a laudable emulation  and , indeed , not to have a play-house upon Shenstone-Green , ( which is , as it were , poets ground , and ought to be dedicated to the muses ) would be a sin and a  shame .
Besides , if we should not be able to furnish new pieces amongst ourselves , there are plenty of play-wrights who will send us their chef d'aeuvres from the capital , where , you know , interest has , now and then , the key of the stage-door  and where the managers themselves generally forestall the dramatick market .
We have been looking about the Green , and find that our play-house will stand vastly well near the Church , or rather between that and Parsonageplace .
So that the muses will be supported by the temple of devotion on one hand , and a doctor of divinity on the other .
This we will call Shenstone-Green Theatre .


FOURTHLY , WE , ( above all other things ) have set our hearts upon a  Masquerade , which is at once so innocent , so elegant , and so universally admired , that , not to have a monthly one on Shenstone-Green would be such an impeachment upon our want of taste as never was heard of .
This , therefore , must be put in hand immediately .
Masks and dominos may be had from Tavistock-street , London .
Fancy-dresses depend on ourselves .


LASTLY , WE propose a weekly Concert of Musick , and , for cheapness sake , the same band may serve for the orchestra of our theatre .
But as these dear amusements will , under your patronage , sir , be ours , we shall , by way of getting back some of our charges , tax all tickets taken by strangers .
The Shenstonian pensioners  being the only persons to be admitted gratis , excepting our good and amiable patron , Sir Benjamin , who is , in each place , to have a lodge with a decorated canopy fitted up and properly illuminated , under the title of Beauchamp Box , or the Lord President 's Place on Shenstone-Green .


Signed by all the Ladies of the Green , except Miss Eliza Elliot , who obstinately refuses : but as we consider that girl a particular kind of creature ( too grave and too glum for her age ) her suffrage hath not been much solicited .


Here endeth , reader , the ladies petition , and here beginneth a new chapter with a sigh .

THE WHISTLER WHISTLES LUSTILY ALL THROUGH THIS CHAPTER .


 HEIGHO , Samuel !
this is promising work .
Is it not ?


Since the writing hereof , sir , there have been some of the fair petitioners at my office , just to strengthen their arguments , by assuring your Honour that , with those few diversions mentioned in their list , they will undertake to make Shenstone-Green superior either to Bath or Paris .
They add , furthermore - and as all spoke of it together , there is the less doubt of their sincerity - that , there shall not be a single hour in the day or night , but what shall bear its characteristic  amusement .
Shenstone-Green , Samuel - I believe they might say , old Samuel - Shenstone-Green , old Samuel , shall have more ton than any spot in the habitable globe , and , by the crouds of fashion which we shall gather about us , the jubilees of the dear poet Shenstone , shall be more vivant , and more vogueish , than those , even headed by his mirrour Mr. Garrick , of Shakespeare himself .
After this , they fluttered out of my office , which was never so perfumed before .


And would you not prevent this inundation of luxury , which , Samuel , can not possibly , be admitted without an inundation of folly also ?


Prevent it sir , said Matilda , who was sitting on Mr. Seabrooke 's knee .
 Why would you prevent it ?
What can be more harmless than a Pantheon ?


Whew - said Mr. Seabrooke .


More innocent than a Cornely 's ?
said Matilda .


Whew - said Mr. Seabrooke .


More moral than a play-house ?
demanded Matilda .


Whew - Whew - replied Seabrooke .


Or more enchanting than a masquerade ?
asked Matilda .


Whew - Whew - Whew , answered Mr. Seabrooke , lengthening and loudning his tone , and taking Matilda in his arms into the garden .


You hear Mr. Seabrooke 's sentiment of the matter , Samuel , said I .


 I must own , sir , the gentleman 's whistle is loud against it .
I take those Whews all to be in the negative : flatly in the negative .


Shall I then forbid such nonsenses , Mr. Sarcasm ?


Your Honour half tempteth me to Whew in the manner of the merry gentleman , who is playing at romps yonder on the grass-plats with Miss Matilda .
What signifies your Honour 's forbidding a large party of ladies doing the things which they have set their hearts upon .
Sure your Honour knoweth as little of women as men .


But I so well know the consequence , Samuel .
I am so well convinced , that Shenstone-Green would be in as much  agitation and rattle as London , were I to suffer these nonsenses .


And that is the very reason , sir , why the ladies will certainly carry their designs into execution , nem .
con .
Rattle is the thing they admire .


Indeed , Samuel ?


Besides , sir , they offer only to introduce things that are allowed in all genteel places , and though your honour chooses to run down causes to their effects  women seldom go that way to work : they stick firmly to the cause , and if that tickles , they never look far enough to pick up a nasty consequence , that would only put the poor dears into a perspiration .
Again , sir , have you not made them  independent , and the free agent , doth as he listeth , I have heard .


There , Samuel , is the rub .
I have tied my hands voluntarily behind me .
I left all to the operations of grateful hearts , and imagined that such liberty would be law at Shenstone-Green .


It is plain therefore , that your Honour must give up this point  so we will go to another .


With a very bad grace I can assure thee , Mr. Sarcasm .


Things not possible your Honour knows , should not be attempted .
Please to mark therefore your consent , and I will signify the same to the ladies , who protested they should neither eat , drink , or sleep till I sent  your answer .
'T is a lady 's maxim , sir , to be restless till she hath her fair longing .


I now wrote underneath this petition , which was , by the by , abominably scrawled , agreeable to Dr. Swift 's observation , from corner to corner , the word granted  and my hand so trembled as I gave my sanction to folly , that I wrote almost as unintelligibly polite as the ladies .


Sarcasm signed the petition , as witness , with a fist perfectly firm  and , saying , he imagined I had enough for one day , adjourned till another opportunity , the examination of the other papers .

IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE A CONSTABLE ON SHENSTONE-GREEN .


 I HAD scarce time to breathe upon this circumstance , before one of a different kind , but tending equally to show me I was but a foolish fellow , started up in the form of the following intelligence  which , by way of desert , was brought just after I had dined .


To Sir B. BEAUCHAMP .


HONOURED PATRON ,


THE abandoned women , whom a certain young Shenstonian first countenanced and then dismissed , have not yet quitted the village , though , we understand , they were  furnished by Mr. Danby with money sufficient to take them to whence they came .
Seeing them flare about the neighbourhood from day to day , to the great annoyance of female virtue , which is under the shadow of Sir Benjamin 's wings , I sought out the haunt which they frequent , and by virtue of mine holy office , exhorted them to quit our Paradise , threatning , at the same time , that if they did not , they should be first excommunicated , and then driven out by the angel of our garden with a flaming sword .
They answered hereunto very unseemly , first , saying that they had as much right to live in Paradise as a parson , and , that as to excommunication , that would only be to forbid them going to a  place , which is the last public exhibition they should at any time think of troubling .
After this they changed their address , and desired me to sit sociably down .
Albeit my profession might be degraded , and my cloth stained by sitting me down amongst the naughty ones  I resolved for once to approach pollution in the hope of wiping it away with holy exhortation .
Hereupon , I rehearsed that chapter of the everlasting volume , which the scriptural sage in the character of a father , giveth to young men .
I began with My son , my son , hearken unto the words of my mouth , c. - and went quite through .
- But mark the progress of abandoned hearts .
All the time I was predicating , they  assumed an affected gravity , which imposed upon my simplicity .
One of them , patted me upon my cheek , under pretence of praising the voice with which I exhorted , and squeezed my hand , while she declared I had the true pulpit deportment .
A second stroaked my chin , and observed , that , as eloquence was apt to parch the tongue , it might be as well if I were to call for my bottle .
while the third - for the fourth had fled elsewhere for shame - drew her palm along my knee , and even to the taper of my thigh , saying , she wished her eyes might drop out of her head if I was not a very proper man .
Now it was that I perceived I had got into a den of thieves , who wanted to steal away the virtue ,  which I came to inspire .
Yes , my honoured patron , three pair of black eyes , - sent their flames at my honour  and it was only by a precipitate retreat , after being much stirred , in which I lest my hat and wig , which they swore should pay for my priggish impertinence , that I could save mine integrity from the snare .
As I ran baldheaded from the door , they hooted me with one accord  and , strange to tell , I have been scarce out of my bed since .


It is incumbent that these evils be done away , and that these fair devils be cast out of Shenstone-Green , which otherwise will be like unto the Strand , where once upon a time , I  was carried off in my canonicals , and stripped of every thing but - MY PURITY .


I am , honoured patron , Your humble servant , CHARLES CUSHEON .


Parsonage-Place .
How one imprudence treads on another said I , after having read this letter aloud !


But you see , said Matilda , smiling , the bad women are wholly gone from Mr. - you knows who 's papa .


( I concealed Mr. Danby 's name at the time of reading this letter ) .


I begin to think , friend Beauchamp , said Mr. Seabrooke , we must have such a thing as a CONSTABLE in this  same Shenstone-Green .
Sic transit gloria mundi .


A constable , answered I , in great consternation  a constable on Shenstone-Green ?


Faith , I begin to think so too , said the little apothecary ( who that day dined at the Mansion-house , and who had been thrown into an immoderate fit of laughter , by the ludicrous idea of the baldheaded priest when he was on the retreat ) .
And now you talk of that , said Mr. Elixer , I have a little private business to communicate .


Matilda withdrew .
Mr. Seabrooke rose up from the table .
And can my dear Seabrooke think it possible for him to retire ?


 Whew - replied he , wheeling off into the garden , where he would sometimes pass half a day upon the grass-plats in the sunshine .


Look-you , my dear , cried the worthy Welchman , when we were alone .
I have got a proclamation of war in my pocket .
Yes , my dear , war has been declared in Shenstone-Green for some time , and here is a correct list of the killed and wounded .
Elixir Ned , must knock them dead yet .
Read , read .


`` A list of patients now under the cure of Edward Elixir , apothecary and surgeon to the Shenstonian pensioners . ''


But look you my patron said the doctor , I do not let you see this to  betray the confidence which should be sacred in my profession , but because I am a little man who loves gratitude , and thinks he ought to have no secrets with a person like Sir Benjamin Beauchamp  for that Sir Benjamin has made me , Edward Elixir , the richest , and the gayest , and the happiest man in Wales .
Yes , I do say , the happiest man in Wales .
My little wife , Sir Benjamin , has got , through your kindness , a large easy chair which runs upon castors , and I aired her yesterday , for the first time , all about the Green : Yes , and then we both laughed together at the conceit , till our mirth became , as it were , a contagious disorder which put into convulsions all the pensioners who beheld us .
If you had seen , sir ,  this sight , how you would have laughed !
Only to think of such a slender hop-o ' - my-thumb as I , harnessed to a kind of go-cart , almost as big as a waggon , running off at full speed with such an amazing fine-sized firm-fleshed woman as my wife !
Only think of a skipping flea hopping away with the majestic elephant !
Oh Jesus !
my patron , my patron , how happy you have made Teddy Elixir !


Teddy Elixir now falling into one of his pleasure-fits , I left him to enjoy it upon a sopha , where he rolled about , while I read his list of killed and wounded .


D. Danby , Esq. .
Attendance every day .


 C. Cusheon , Vicar .
Every day but Sunday .


Without going any farther , I expressed my hearty concern for these gentlemen , and desired to know the nature of their disorders .
Are these pensioners wounded or killed , Mr. Elixir ?
It must be a very sudden affair .


Alas , sir , answered the apothecary , Venus wounds in a moment .


Venus , Mr. Elixir !
Venus ?


Lookee you , my patron , you live here at your Mansion-house without knowing what passes in your village .
We have of late been visited by four Venuses , who have brought more business upon my hands than I ever had on the  Green before .
There is warm work going on , I promise you  but , sir you still , my patron .
I will send Venus packing , I warrant .
I will blow a little powder in her bright eyes that shall make her remember coming upon Shenstone Green , never fear .


The plain truth then , Mr. Elixir , divested of your embellishment , is , that the unhappy women , who were attracted to the Green by those confounded races , have -


Yes , yes , my patron , exactly that , my patron .
Exactly that .


And , amongst other victims less distinguished , are , I presume , these gentlemen .


 Jesus , my patron , how well you guess .
If I could have guessed half so well , I wish I may never laugh again .


And do you think this a laughing matter , Mr. Elixir ?


My patron , it is no more than this skip .
Our methods of treating that affair are now so infallible , that -


But the wickedness , and the impropriety of the affair  how will you cure that , Mr. Apothecary ?
That is something more than your skip , I hope , is it not ?


Look-you , my dear patron , Edward Elixir never meddles with other men 's business .
I stick close to the carcase , which I know how to manage  tolerably well .
But as for the mind , that is clean out of my way .
That is a branch belonging to Mr. Cusheon the vicar .
I can only master Death  it is the parson , who should struggle with the Devil .
Ha !
ha !
ha !


But I am astonished , Mr. Elixir , that so sober , discreet and classical a man as Mr. Cusheon should -


Why should my patron be astonished , that asober , discreet , classical man should catch one of the commonest distempers now in the world ?
We are all liable to accidents .
Alas !
the classics are not exempt from the strokes of the female gender .


But his profession Mr. Elixir - Ha !
ha !
ha !


 Lack a day , if you think the worse of him for what I have told you , my patron , I shall be the most miserable man in the world - There is my blind side .
I am so used to run about with what I hear in order to tell it , which is the way I worked myself first into any practise  for one can not take a pint of blood from a country patient , but he will have from me a pound of news into the bargain , so that I can not help chattering , let the consequence be what it will .
This is the complaint that every body makes against me , while almost every body tempts me to sin .
Oh !
how I do hate Mr. Edward Elixir !
how I do hate Mr. Edward Elixir !


But hear me , Mr. Apothecary - hear me - it is an affair of moment .
I am hurt .
I am stung .


 Oh !
my patron , tell me , I pray you , what can make me such a little infamous apothecary as I am ?
Why should I cure my patient with my hand , only to wound him again , worse than ever , with my tongue !
Curse my tongue , how dare it jabber out things sacred and profane in this manner !
You ought to discard me , my patron - for Mr. Cusheon is a soft , sleek , gentle gentleman , as ever put on a cassock  and Mr. Danby is the best and most generous esquire that ever came into Wales .
What things do I know of his doing ?
and have I blabbed the only thing that could injure him in the esteem of my patron ?
Oh !
what a complete little villain I am ?
Oh !
Elixir !
Elixir !
skilled as thou art in simples , thou  art the most atrocious rascal , of a small man , that ever breathed a vein .
Look-you , my patron , look-you , if it was not for my poor little wife , who would die if she lost her trundler , I would deliver myself into the hands of justice and be hanged directly .
Edward - Edward .
Teddy , Teddy , Elixir , Elixir .
Fie !
fie !
fie !


While our medical phaenomenon was uttering this rhapsody , he sometimes addressed me , then himself  sometimes stood so as to observe his figure in the glass , as if willing to have his own image in view , while he loaded it with abuse  and sometimes , he pranced about the room in an agony of rage , twitching his wig from side to side , and leaping from chair to chair .
But , at length , the  vociferation with which he mentioned his being hanged , c. brought Seabrooke and Matilda into the room , where they apprehended something was the matter .
Seeing them advance , the wretched apothecary ( imagining they were come to hear his difgrace ) caught up his hat , as was always his custom  and after assuring us once more , that he was a most infamous little rascal , ran out of doors .

A DISCOVERY WHICH NONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED .


 I WAS contriving how to conceal the circumstance of Mr. Danby from my poor panting Matilda , who always suspected the conversation turned upon him , though she even had discretion enough to conceal his very name from Seabrooke .
Just as I had hit off an excuse , which I imagined plausible , a most violent thundering at the front door announced four visitors , who were never in the Mansion-house before .
They were of the female kind , and three of them so ridiculously discoloured by  paint , and so burnt with flaming robes and ornaments , that the gentle Matilda , who was habited simply in an unpretending tender-looking lustring , and a white straw hat bound with a single pea-green band , looked like the angel of peace by the side of the furies .
She hurried into Seabrooke 's arms  and , from that sancturary , beheld the scene .


Sir , said one of the women , cocking up the corner of her hat , I suppose you are the proprietor of this Shenstone-Green .


I am , madam .


If you are then , sir , I should be glad to know how a gentleman , pluming himself upon his generosity , can suffer four unhappy women , who are  obliged to attend publick places , to be insulted ?


I really do not understand you , madam .


Let me speak , Nancy , to him , ( said a second woman , more furiously capped and hatted than the other ) .
I think your name is Sir Benjamin Beauchamp ?


I am so called , madam .


Pray then , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , what right have your virtuous b - h - s of the Green -


Whew - cried Mr. Seabrooke , giving a louder whistle than I ever before heard , and running out of the room with the ever-delicate Matilda .


 So much the better , said the woman , resuming the conversation .
Now Miss Mock Modesty is gone , I can speak my mind plainer .
I was going to ask , sir , why you permit such virtuous b - h - s , as some of your pensioners to sneer at us as we pass their doors ?


I suppose you are the ladies who have created such disturbances then in the village  if so , you can not wonder at any slights you may have received for the irregularity of your conduct .


Pray , Sir Benjamin , let me speak : ( said a third woman of a less bold appearance , more decently dressed , and extremely fine featured ) These ladies , sir , are apt to be warm in their tempers   I have seen more misfortunes , and am more tranquil .
Have I leave to speak sir ?


You have , madam .


The four women , Sir Benjamin , who are now before you , have been all ruined by your sex .
We had once the innocence of your own daughter .
Each had too tender a heart , and threw away its noblest affections upon a villain who deceived it .
Our parents thrust us from their protection , and the door of every friend was shut against us .
The women of virtue , who , perhaps , have given few real proofs of it , often told us , we might honestly work for a subsistence .
But , this is only one of the many pretences of goodluck , when it wants an apology for insulting distress .
 Who will employ an handsome young woman discarded by her natural friends , and left struggling in the streets .
We have found no such protectors .
What remained after such unhappy experience ?
To put ourselves into eternity , would have added the crime of murder to the misfortune of violation .
To expect assistance from men , on any pure or disinterested principle , was absurdity .
Our youth , our beauty , our forlorn situation , were all arguments against such protection .
Which is it , sir , of your sex , that will honourably shelter our 's under such circumstances  or which is it , that does not rejoice to see a lovely form reduced to purchase ?


To exist , sir , is the natural effort of an human being  and you know  the terms on which our bread was to be procured .
Why then should we be insulted ?
Why should complaints be formally lodged against us , as we understand they are , by persons who have better luck than ourselves ?
With regard to our coming to this village , we have , alas !
but too solid an apology for it .
We are the slaves of publick events , and always obliged to have a look out for novelties  we are compelled to take advantage of any thing that may promise a prospect of support .
We shift our habitations as men shift theirs  and whenever any place is celebrated as the resort of much company , there , alas !
it is our fatal lot to go and partake the transient popularity without the joy .
It was told to us by those whom  we employed for such purposes , that a person of fortune had erected a new town for the use of those whom mischance had brought into decay .
We dared not propose ourselves as candidates  but we thought that those who leaped suddenly into prosperity from the lowest state of indigence or oppression , were the proper objects to relieve us .
Lightly come , lightly go , you know , sir .
It was probable that the passions would lead to dissipation such as became all at once masters of a good fortune .
Upon the faith of this expectation , we set off for Shenstone-Green , where , we thought we had as natural a right to try our fortune as any other vagabonds .
As to your principle of building this town upon the basis of  purity , we are , unhappily , not in situations to pay much regard to such ideas .
Delicacy is obliged to yield to necessity in our unfortunate case  perhaps , sir , we might , in luckier situations , have contributed as much to the glory of Shenstone Green , and merited as much the bounty of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , as those who now treat us with indignity .
Nay , sir , I even think that , hard as it is with us , you might have founded your village upon a basis of juster and truer benignity .


How so , madam , said I , not a little affected by her discourse , or with the firm , yet gentle , manner in which it was delivered - In what particulars , could I have improved the plan of Shenstone-Green ?


 Pardon me , sir , resumed the young woman , if I say your bounty might , at the same expence , have been led through more beneficent channels  some of its streams , might , surely , have extended to US .
-


I started .


Yes , sir , continued the lady , you may start  but believe me , Shenstone-Green , hath not included the most pitiable part of the creation , nor indeed , that part , which , under proper regulation , have the most pathetic claim upon the proprietor 's attention .
Custom , it is true , may deaden the delicacy of those feelings , which are the distinguishing ornaments of the female , and habit , may assist extreme indigence in conquering our natural decency  but it is not always a sign  that we are irreclaimable , when we yield ourselves up to the only alternative that is left .
Even the unwarrantable language we sometimes make use of , may find a palliative in the extremities to which we are driven .
Those , sir , who live in a more elevated state of misfortune , as they are liable to the brutality only of one man , so are they less excuseable , if they commit those crimes which it is in their power to prevent .
For , in my opinion , errours are pardonable and punishable in proportion , as the situation of the culprit renders them more necessary .


Crimes necessary !
madam , said I .


It is very possible , sir , for certain faults to be if not necessary at least  inevitable .
They are annexed to a condition , which can neither be prevented by the person who is reduced , any more than the faults which result from -


This doctrine I fear , madam , cried I , interfering - This doctrine will not -


Sir , said the lady , interrupting in her turn : I advance only what I know to be fatally true .
My ignorance in the arts of argument , may , perhaps , involve the fact , I desire to explain , in some obscurity , or in too many words  but I am , nevertheless , convinced of the fact itself .
How , for instance , is it possible to prevent the effects of our distress ?
We are  obliged to the dreadful drudgery of suiting ourselves to publick caprice .
We are obliged to consult every man 's particular mode of gratification .
Nature , I believe , sir , leads to a decent behaviour  but there are , I fear , five perverted appetites , which lean to the grossest pleasure , to one that is delicate or true to the original bias of the human feelings .
I myself , Sir Benjamin , am an example of the truth I would illustrate .
I remember the time when the excess of my timidity was imputed to me , by my relations , as a fault .
I blushed almost at myself .
In this state of my innocence , when all the affections were fair and impressive , a man pretended a generous passion , and , when he had thoroughly  made it reciprocal , by breathing a real ardour into a guiltless heart , he abused it .
The old story was again repeated .
I was treated as the toy which could please no longer , and bequeathed by this barbarous betrayer to his brother-rakes .


These , were all in the higher ranks of libertinism , and for that reason I heard less vulgar language , and saw fewer examples of vice .
So that , though it would be absurd to represent myself as a virtuous woman , I should have been left wholly without an apology had I been plunged so deep as my companions .


What are not you as wicked a wretch as us , Fanny ?
cried all the other women .


 Give me leave resumed the young creature - I did not mean to insinuate that as my praise , but as your excuse .
If you now and then yield to words that might be better not spoken  it is , I know , because you have had few advantages .
Considering the cruelties which you have undergone  the company you have been obliged to keep in order to humour the whim of your friends , and the necessities you had on all hands to encounter , it would be very extraordinary if you had not picked up some habits which you are far from admiring , even in yourselves .
I very well know , Sir Benjamin , that good hearts beat in the bosoms of these my forlorn associates .
I have seen them share their  hard-earned profits with those who have appealed to their bounty .
I have seen also the tears drop from their eyes at the agony of that rigid virtue , which would not easily have been persuaded to feel as softly for them .
They riot , it is true , but it is to drown the sense of the most poignant reflection , which would otherwise obtrude to their distraction .
They dissipate it must be confessed , but it is in compliance with the wanton taste of their visitors .
I own even that an oath may occasionally pass their lips  but it is the effect of unhappy practice , and never comes deliberately from the mind .


 Ah !
madam , said I , you touch me too , too tenderly .


All the other poor creatures dropped the air of audacity , and held down their heads to conceal at once their shame and their distress .


If , sir , added the lady , it is yet necessary to enlarge the features of this horrid picture , that I have taken from the life  suffer me to observe , that , we are often beaten for an air of modesty , and rewarded for an appearance of wantonness  we are equally the sport of the brute , and of the bailiff .
We are shut out of society that might revive our morals , and we are driven to such as , of necessity , must make us worse .
Now then tell  me , sir , if we are not , in some sort , justifiable for seeking a shelter where , at least , our disgrace was not so publick , and where were , in hope , that benevolence was the same in the pensioners of Shenstone-Green , as in the bosom of the proprietor .
We came hither with such ideas , and yet , if my companions would condescend to take council from my example , they would retire from the neighbourhood and try again their fortune in the bustles and beatings of the world .
For my own part , sir , I will delay my departure hence , no longer than while I observe , that , if Sir Benjamin Beauchamp had contrived some quiet asylum , where the blushes of the most  unhappy women might have been concealed from -


While the beautiful and abused Fanny was proceeding in her sentence , a person tapped at the door of the apartment , and , when it was opened , there came hobbling in a large lame man whom I had never seen .


Before the stranger entered , the women had all turned their faces from the door , as if unwilling to be caught in tears .


I come on my stumps to your Honour , ( said the man ) to thank you for your kind intentions in favour of an old battered fellow , who is proud of his scars .
Heaven always raises up a friend to the brave .
I am just  told by your Honour 's steward , that , after tugging about the globe , and sustaining many strokes of the body abroad , and more of the heart at home , poor old Hackney Oldblade -


No sooner was this name pronounced than , the most piercing shriek , that , surely ever was uttered , came from the very soul of the young creature who had been so pathetically pleading for herself and her companions .


This shriek burst from the afflicted Fanny  the man no sooner heard the voice of a woman in distress , than he forgot the want of his limbs , and ran upon his stumps to offer assistance  but the moment he cast his eye on the  sufferer , whose agonies increased , the crutches dropped from his hands , and he fell lifeless on the floor .


Mr. Seabrooke and Matilda came hurrying in : and just as they appeared , the other three women were so agitated , that they retreated in the utmost confusion .

HUMANITY AGAIN LOOKS EAIR , AND SHINES THROUGH HER TEARS .


 ISTOOD fixed in amazement  while Matilda was assiduously applying her smelling bottle to Fanny , and Seabrooke was rubbing the temples of Oldblade .


Oh !
Fanny , Fanny , ( cried the latter recovering ) see to what you have brought your miserable father .


Father !
said Matilda - Oh poor , poor dear !


It is you , Fanny , who are the author of all these broken limbs , and of all these deep furrows , in the  front of poor Oldblade .
Your mother 's heart broke the year after you left us , and then I did not care what became of me .
I wasted the good fortune which uncle Tibbs left me , because I wanted to wash away the thought of ever having had a daughter .
After this , Fan , I went to sea a second time , spent all the profits of my first voyage , ( near five hundred pounds ) got my legs knocked off , all these scars in my poor breast , and then came home to find all my old friends dead , and beg my bread on his majesty 's highway .


All the time the poor fellow was uttering these sentiments he was endeavouring , by every means in his power , to revive and comfort the unhappy Fanny , who was dissolved  in the tears of penitence and despair .
She drew her hand over her eyes and was by no means able to speak .


Touched at this , the parent assumed its irresistible authority in the bosom of the soldier so absolutely , that he cried out , Well , well , Fanny , do n't cry , child , do n't take on .
I forgive thee all my wounds , and all my sorrows .
Thee hast , perhaps , had enough of thy own .
But , why didst thou suffer poor Hackney to hunt town and country after thee so long ?
Where didst thee hide thy misery all that time ?


Indeed , sir - ( said Fanny , raising her head but still shutting her eyes ) indeed , I was not quite abandoned .
I was a solitary wretch who wept in  secret .
Even now , though poverty drove me to seek shelter in this place , I have never been able to adopt the example of my associates  and , had it not been for the disinterested bounty of one good gentleman on the Green , I must certainly have starved .


Of one gentleman ( cried Matilda , in great confusion ) .
Pray what is his name ?


Mr. Henry Hewit , madam , answered Fanny .
This good man it was who saw me unable to pursue the usual practises of my condition , and took care to provide me with the necessaries of life ever since my sickness , and I have been very ill - indeed I have .


 I am easy , said Matilda  Mr. Henry Hewit is an angel .
I , I thought it was him .


But art sick now , naughty Fan , ( said Oldblade , drawing up gently the head of her cloak round her neck . )
Well , well , but are you sure it was Mr. Henry Hewit that -


Here Henry himself came into the room to show me how well he looked in his old working clothes .
He was just beginning to shake his trowel and flourish his apron , when Fanny started up and exclaimed - Good God !
my benefactor is here .
Bless him !
bless him !


Lookee , Master Henry , said the soldier , I have no knees , and so I  ca n't cleverly come down upon them  but , with all the small shot which have passed through and through these arms , I can , with some pain , ( which I do n't heed ) lift them up to you , as I have often lifted them up to God Almighty , to thank you for the care you have taken of my poor stray daughter .


Daughter !
( exclaimed Henry , throwing his trowel on the floor ) and have I been all this time protecting the daughter of my friend and superior , Master Oldblade , without knowing it ?
Ah !
Miss Fanny , did not I tell you things would turn out better than you imagined ?
Poor soul , your Honour , she said , she wanted to be a good girl but nobody would give  her the means , however , said she to me , I have broke my mother and father 's heart , and so what becomes of me does not signify .


My splinter of a shoulder must hurt thy naughty face , Fan  stay , hussey , and let me make thee a bit of a pillow thus , said the father , who took off an old silk handkerchief from his neck , and spread it for the cheek of his daughter .


Not give thee the means to be a good girl , says I - ( continued Hewit ) .
What !
and are you obliged to be wicked against your will ?
Here 's a world for you , said I. - So upon this , your Honour , I gave her a little of that which was of no use to me , and  she promised me she would live in my house when I got into the Tradesman 's - Corner , and keep me tight and clean - but , do n't you suppose , Master Oldblade , that , because of this , and because I am not quite an old fellow , that - that I -


Stop , stop , Henry , stop , ( hollowed , with all his force , Mr. Oldblade ) - do n't say a word more .
Do n't say any thing that must make me cut your throat .
If you could suppose I thought Henry Hewit capable -


Capable , father - Oh !
he is - the most -


I wo n't be praised , I wo n't have foolish fancies said to me , Miss Fanny - Give  me your hand - If your father says I may kiss your lips , why I 'll kiss them in the face of his Honour and the company , and there 's an end o n't .
Here 's a noise , indeed , about nothing .


Kiss the naughty hussey , if thee wilt , Henry , answered Oldblade , but I wish I may be damned if the pain of a cannon ball made such a puling baby of me as I am at this minute .
I wish I may be damned if it did .


Henry was advancing to Fanny , who , blushing ten thousand graces , lifted up her head and looked at the company , as if she begged us not to think of her too hardly .


 Good as you are , Master Hewit , ( cried Oldblade , in an extacy ) she is my daughter , she is my own dear naughty Fanny , and I have a right to have the first kiss .
Huffey ( continued he almost sobbing ) how dare you lift your head from my neck till I bid you ?


Do n't , do n't , do n't be so kind , sir .
You will kill me , said Fanny .
You will break my heart .


And mine too , I protest , said Matilda .


I will go stop the crack in your Honour 's chimnies , said Henry ( who kissed Fanny 's hand as it lay on her father 's bosom and then went out . )


 Will your Honour permit , said Oldblade , this naughty girl to have a little room in the house which your kind heart is about to give an old soldier ?
She sha n't stay , I promise you , if - if - if -


Oh Father - Father !
said Fanny .
Spare , spare me .


Go together , honest fellow , said I , and take thy daughter not only to thy house but to thy heart .
I will be with thee presently .


Master Oldblade , ( said Mr. Seabrooke , who had been all the time in great agitation ) you and your daughter Fanny , and your friend Hewit , have given me some pretty severe pangs , for which I shall love  all three of you while I have breath in my body .


While Seabrooke was saying this , Matilda was busy in adjusting the discomposed cheeks , hair , and hood of Fanny .
She wiped the tears from her eyes with her own handkerchief .
She smoothed the locks that hung disordered , and then said to me , in a whisper , that she thought it would look like a little sanction which the poor dear seemed to deserve , if I would permit her to go across the Green with Fanny .
Then , you know , papa , said she , none of the people will dare to think ill of her .


Charmed with so exquisite , and , alas !
so uncommon a mark of female  humanity , I left my permission with a kiss upon the mouth that graced the proposal .
Upon which Matilda ran to the glass to put on her little straw hat , and then said , now Captain Oldblade , I am ready to conduct you and Fanny to your new house .
I know the nearest way .


The father of Fanny stood amazed , and Fanny herself was covered with crimson .
Such was the wonderful effect of that great surprize - the seeing one woman truly feel for another .
With much intreaty , Fanny was persuaded to lay her trembling arm within that of Matilda 's , who seemed to be ostentatious of her acquaintance , and in that manner they left the Mansion-house .


 What an adventure hath here been  and how are the events of this life brought to pass , my friend , said I to Mr. Seabrooke !


Good evening to you , Sir Benjamin , answered Seabrooke , I am going to bed .


At four o'clock in the afternoon , my friend ?


As every thing I can possibly see , betwixt this and bed-time , said Seabrooke , must be poor in the comparison , I shall only blunt the divine edge of my present sensations , by staring at ordinary occurrences , and so I am resolved to shut myself up  from further interruption till a new day .


I humoured his characteristick peculiarity , and we parted .

CONTAINING A DUEL WHICH FEW READERS COULD FORESEE .


 FINDING myself left alone in the midst of such voluptuous reflections , I walked forth to meet my daughter on her return , that we might share them together : I found her within a few yards of the Mansion-house , coming to me with full speed to tell me , that she left Oldblade and Fanny in the arms of each other .
Yes , papa , said she , and there the poor dear lies blushing , while the soldier chides and kisses her  at parting , Fanny lifted up her streaming eyes , and cried out in such a voice as made me weep too - Oh !
Miss Matilda , Miss Matilda , were there many  women like you , there would be more female virtue , and fewer guilty wretches like Fanny Oldblade .
Lord , papa , is it so very extraordinary to behave kind to one 's own sex ?


What right have you to call yourself names hussey , there are worse than you yet , said her father ?
So , seeing the old fellow going to warm something in a little sauce-pan on the fire , which , he said , was a cordial to him in the worst of times , and would be so to the naughty hussey , who was nevertheless , he said , his own flesh and blood .
Then I came away , papa , to make you and Mr. Seabrooke happy .


Mr. Seabrooke , my dear , said I , is so happy already that he is gone to bed .


`` To eat in dreams the custard of the day , ''


 I suppose , replied Matilda in the liveliest manner , applying a line from her favourite poet .


Then let us eat ours , my dear , said I , in the wood , broad awake  it is , you see , one of the finest evenings we could wish , and `` seems as it were `` sent to invite the world abroad , '' answered Matilda , using another quotation from a different author .


Heighty , toity , child you are quite poetical to night .


Quite poetical , papa , Lord who can help it ?
Poetry , I have heard say , was first invented when the heart was too happy to be contented with prose .
I declare I could now repeat half the verses of Pope and Shenstone , till the  village should re-echo with beautiful verses .


Oh !
brave !
Why then you are in the best humour in the world for an evening 's walk in the wood ?
Every leaf and flower will , at this time of the night , furnish a gay heart with a rhyme , a simile , or a sentiment .


Yes , papa , but I have prettier things than leaves and flowers to make me poetical at present .
Fanny Oldblade , never saw Mr. Danby .
There , papa , is news for you , Fanny Oldblade never saw Mr. Danby .


How have you found that out , Matilda ?
Oh !
oh !
let girls alone to find out secrets , papa .
But I will tell you all about it  you must know that , when the women came first to town ,  poor Fanny was so ill as scarce to hold her head up , and was obliged to keep in bed while the other women went about .
One of them , told Mr. Danby , they had a sick friend at home who could not stir out , upon which , Mr. Danby put his hand into his pocket and gave them five guineas - only think , papa , of five guineas - to buy proper comforting things for her  but the cruel creatures kept all the money , and Fanny never knew at all of the affair till her father , who was present at the time , asked her , if she was not the person who received five guineas from Mr. Danby .
I have received no money , said she , father , since I have been in this part of the world , except from Mr. Hewit , who totally supported me , and - Fanny ,  papa , was going on with her speech when I ran up to her and kissed her cheek ten times over .


But why , Matilda , did you take that fit of fondness in your head , just at that crisis ?


Why , just then ?
Oh !
Heavens , papa !
How can you ask such a question ?
I will assure you , papa , I loved her from that moment better than ever  so , without talking any more , let us listen to the musick of the groves :


Ye flowing Plains , ye breezy Woods , Ye Bowers and gay Alcoves , Ye falling Streams , ye silver Floods , Ye Grottoes and ye Groves !
Upon my word , Matilda , you tag every tenth word with a rhyme .


 We were by this time wandering arm and arm in Shenstone-Wood , and , propensely , deviated into such paths as were least frequented  but one would think , that this forest was fated to produce an adventure as often as ever I entered it .
The curfew was just flinging its sound through the trees , when all of a sudden , we distinctly heard a voice coming from the left , pronouncing these words .
Sir , the clock strikes , it is the moment promised  I am glad to see you so exact .
The next moment , we heard a reply to this , in the clashing of swords , which denoted a very obstinate engagement .
I am a bad swordsman , sir , cried some one  then make use of your pistols , sir , replied another .
In a minute after , two pistols were  discharged - Mr. Danby !
exclaimed some person , you are wounded , the blood is upon your shirt .
I feel it not , replied Danby , load again , sir .


To prevent any further mischief , I would now have rushed forwards , but my poor child had fainted at my feet , and I was struggling to get her up into my arms .
Meanwhile the combatants again fired , and a voice directly exclaimed , My God !
he drops  Desist , sir , desist , he is at the point of death .


The shriek , which the wretched Matilda now gave , went at once through her father 's heart , and alarmed the persons who occasioned it .
Two of them came rushing through the bushes , and one , whose name the  reader need scarce be told , fell down at the feet of Matilda , and cursed himself as the cause .


As if sensible to his touch , she opened her eyes , and cried out - Ah !
Danby , what have you been doing ?
But you are safe , and I am happy .
Here she dropped suddenly on her knee , and remained in that posture some time without speaking .


Though I dared not intimate my fears , I saw Mr. Danby 's danger , against whose bosom I pressed my handkerchief to stop the blood , which , in despite of all my efforts , was flowing over his shirt .
But , just as I was going to whisper my apprehensions to a man who thus forgot his wounds in the embraces of his mistress - embraces  which I did not attempt to hinder - another person came forward , who said he had extracted the ball from the side and groin of Mr. Sidney .


Mr. Sidney , exclaimed I , and was Mr. Sidney the antagonist of Mr. Danby !


Look-you , my patron , replied Mr. Elixir - for it was he who attended as surgeon - neither Mr. Sidney , nor Mr. Danby , can possibly die while they are under my care , and as to the rest , though I do not know what they fought upon , I know they fought like two eagles .


Mr. Danby now began to feel his loss of blood , and I made shift to give Elixir the cue to lead him off  to examine his wound , without its being suspected by Matilda .
Danby had already buttoned up his coat and waistcoat to prevent suspicion  but the livid paleness , which came suddenly over his countenance , warned him it was time to get away .
Yet , even in the midst of his agony , his principal care was how to do this , so as not too much to alarm Matilda : assuming therefore a chearful countenance , and calling into it a smile , he cried - Well , Sir Benjamin , we have had our frolick , and can only say , that it is to you and your fair daughter , to whom we are indebted for the life of one or both of us  for Mr. Sidney and I were both so full of our diversion , that we should certainly have gone on to the end of the  chapter had not your interruption saved us .
The cause of the quarrel you shall hear , sir , to-morrow .
In the mean time it is unnecessary to enjoin silence , lest we should give to the idlers of Shenstone-Green too delicate a subject for conversation .


At the end of this speech he took off his hat with a trembling hand , and walked out of the wood very slowly , under the support of his two seconds .
Mr. Elixir followed him by another path , telling us that Mr. Sidney was carried off by his friends , and would run no risque of a discovery .
Elixir skipped about in triumph .


 Perceiving Matilda on the edge of a relapse , I took her in my arms , and blessed the dusk of the night which enabled me to conceal the whole matter .

WHICH IS NECESSARY TO THE NARRATIVE .


 IT is not easy to conceive the terrour in the alteration of my poor daughter 's spirits from their late elevation  and as I was obliged to sit up with her the whole night , I congratulated myself in the midst of my grief , that Seabrooke was in bed  for Matilda was so confident that her friend and instructor , Seabrooke , would disapprove her passion for Danby , she had never once suffered his name to be hinted , and it had always fallen out , hitherto , that when the young man came to the Mansion-house , Seabrooke  was absent .
Early the next morning Mr. Elixir came to inform us , that both the combatants were in a fair way , and that Mr. Danby had been to visit Mr. Sidney , when the quarrel had like to have been renewed for a very trifling reason , namely , by a dispute which arose about the propriety of Mr. Danby , or Mr. Sidney 's beginning the explanation which each esteemed due to their patron .
It is right , said Mr. Sidney , that Sir Benjamin should be fully informed of our mistake , lest he should suppose we were wantonly invading the tranquillity of his village  but for me to tell the story would be -


And if you do not tell it , Mr. Sidney , replied Danby , we must  have another meeting , for , on my part , situated as I am in the family , it would be gross indelicacy to speak first .


But how did it end , Mr. Apothecary , said Matilda , rising up in her bed - How did it end ?


It ended , madam , ( replied Elixir ) giving a skip , and snapping his singers - just as it should do  for a lady at that time coming into the chamber -


A lady !
saids Matilda , agitated - into whose chamber did that lady -


Mr. Sidney 's , to be sure , madam , answered Elixir - a lady , I say , at that time entering the chamber , ran to the bed-side , and cried out , Oh !
 Sidney , I heard of your situation notwithstanding all your caution !


And knowing , madam , as you do the nice feelings of Sidney ( said this gentleman ) how have you had the imprudence to make the matter still more mysterious by this extraordinary visit ?


Extraordinary visit , Mr. Sidney , what , when I did not know but you were breathing your last ?


And if I had your delicate circumspection should have survived the very life of Sidney , Miss Elliot .


Miss Elliot , did you say , cried Matilda , was that the lady - Oh !
heavens !
go on , dear Mr. Elixir , go on .


 Matilda took hold of the apothecary 's hand , and smiled .
I smiled too perhaps from a very different idea .
Mr. Elixir proceeded .


A short altercation ensued between all parties , and when Miss Elliot understood the whole story , she advised , that Mr. Sidney should , dictate while she wrote , and that Mr. Danby and he should mutually sign the paper , which was then to be sent by me , as surgeon , confident , and witness .


And where is that paper , said I , Mr. Elixir ?
There , sir , it is , said the apothecary .
I will leave it with you , and give the finishing stroke to the recovery of my patients .


Lose no time , cried Matilda  and pray , Mr. Elixir , do you know that ,  if you cut across Pleasant-Pastures , and leave the Tradesman 's - Corner as much as possible to the left , you will get there in a trice  and save near a quarter of a mile by it .
But , `` Still your singer on your lips I pray .


I was very glad to hear poetry returning upon Matilda .


As to that , madam , answered Elixir , I have been too infamous a little villain already not to take care of my tongue for the future .


Saying this , he set off , with one of his bounds , for the house of Mr. Sidney  and , as Mr. Seabrooke had not yet come from his chamber , I gave Matilda an opportunity to rise , which she did almost in a moment  and  then she ran to a little summer-house at the bottom of the garden , where we opened the paper of explanation .

CHAP .

THE PARTICULARS OF THE DUEL EXPLAINED .


 THE substance of this was , that Messrs. Danby and Sidney , being in company together , the conversation turned upon the beauties of Shenstone-Green , the principal and the most accomplished of whom , Mr. Sidney insisted , was the object of his affections .
Mr. Danby hereupon asserted with equal fervour , that as he did not conceive there was more than one unmarried lady in the village ,  who could be esteemed perfect , he imagined he had a right to ask the name of the other 's favourite ?
Sidney 's scrupulous delicacy , being hurt at this idea , he protested that none but his Maker and himself should ever know the least syllable that might lead to the detection of so sacred a circumstance  suffice it to say , added he , that it is impossible for Mr. Danby to mistake the person , who maintains her superiority over every other work of animated nature .
Mr. Danby immediately caught fire , and warned Sidney to take care how any passion , be might indulge , met a powerful rival in a man , who was not any more than himself able to bear a  divided affection .
It appears then , said Mr. Sidney , that we love the same person .
It is impossible that it should be otherwise , replied Danby , for you frankly confess there is no second person whose comparative attractions can -


No , sir , replied Sidney , the object of my affections as much surpasses every other on the Green , as -


Then there is no occasion for similes or allusions , sir , rejoined Danby  it is clear we have the misfortune to love the same lady  it only remains to examine the progress of our respective passions , and to settle accordingly .
My passion , sir , continued Danby , has been touched  with the utmost delicacy , so as not to distress the innocent heart of my mistress .


As to delicacy , Mr. Danby , said the other , I believe it will be allowed , by the lady herself , that mine not only exceeds that of Mr. Danby , but even her own .


Sir , I shall not admit your opinion in either instance , and , I have reason to think my delicacy , and my application , more agreeable to the lady than those of Mr. Sidney .


Piqued at this , Sidney demanded of his friend , if he would quit his pretensions without further expostulation ?


 Never , never , sir , answered Danby , while I have the power of these arms to defend them .


Then , sir , cried Sidney , such defence will be necessary directly .
We must settle it without delay .


The paper of explanation acquainted us further , that , after Mr. Sidney had uttered this sentence , Mr. Danby and he called on Mr. Elixir , and one or two more friends , to settle the dispute in the wood .
Matilda and I got there soon after , and from our arrival , to the time of the separation of the whole party , particulars have been already described to the reader .


It was not till after the discharge of their pistols , that they came to  the simple truth of the whole matter  namely , that they had fought very bravely to no purpose , and that the fair picture , which each had drawn of his mistress , did not belong to one woman , but equally to Eliza and Matilda .
The whole only served to prove , that


The lip of the nymph we admire , Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile .
Well , Matilda , said I ( when we had seen this account ) what do you think of this business ?


Shall I be ingenuous , papa , replied she ?
As ingenuous as is convenient , my dear .
Why then , papa , since all the danger is over , and both are in a very fair way , I own I shall not be sorry at this new instance of Mr. Danby 's affection , when I know he  is no longer in pain .
But only think of my sly friend , Eliza , papa  I will be whipped if I ever suspected the matter , and yet now I think of it , her queerness about Mr. Sidney -


Come , come , Matilda , said I , you are as sly as your friend Eliza .
Here are you , every hour almost , with that sagacious whistler , Mr. Seabrooke , and he does not so much as suspect that -


Hush , hush , cried Matilda - Mr. Seabrooke is now just coming to us .
Look , how he strides along the grass-plat , flourishing his garters , and looking to see how much sun he shall have to day !


Thus terminated an unpromising scene very pleasingly .

OF SHENSTONE-GREEN PLAY-HOUSE , PANTHEON , CONCERT-ROOM AND CORNELYS  WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES .


BUT , while these little wounds of the heart were curing , there were others of a more dangerous and malignant nature , breeding in the constitution of Shenstone-Green .


No sooner had I given my permission , or , more properly speaking , no sooner had the ladies drawn from me my `` slow leave , '' to establish  their projects of amusement , than the greatest vigour was employed to dispatch the execution .
By which means , the village was again covered with confusion .
The ardour of the female association was , indeed , so intense , that every scheme was begun at the same time , and , upon going into the Green , a few months after the first fatal idea was started , I had the misery to behold the sudden growth of evils , very remarkably illustrated .
A Pantheon , a Play-House , a Concert-Room , a Cornely 's , and a Temple for the reception of masques , were all pretty nearly in the same forwardness  and publick curiosity was already so much attracted , that , Shenstone-Green , was become the gape and stare of all the  surrounding countries .
The children of expectation ( who are ever upon the catch to subsist upon the projects of local luxury ) came rolling down upon us in torrents  players , fidlers , singers , dancers , and every other instrument of voluptuous expence , spread themselves over the plain , and anticipated their future salary .
And , in order to subsist in the mean time , they set the women upon coaxing me out of consent to their erecting several temporary booths , to entertain the pensioners , till the more regular buildings should be finished .
Accordingly , having put refusal out of my reach , I shook my head , and gave up the point : so that all the fooleries of a fair were now every night practised  on Shenstone-Green .
Poor Seabrooke , grew so thoroughly disgusted with these doings , that he scarce ever went out of the Mansion-house , unless , it was to lay upon the grass-plats in the garden , or seek the shade of the wood , by a private path : and whenever any body spoke on the subject , he whistled .


I must not conceal from the reader , that Mr. Danby took a very active part in this business  since he dismissed the woman , he was a great favourite with the ladies of the Green .
The mind of that young man was , in truth , so turned to expence and magnificence  his natural spirits were so excessive  and his imagination so expanded , that every new idea , which  was set off by gaiety , commanded his whole attention , and drove him to the last extremities .
Several striking instances of this appeared in the course of carrying on the new buildings .
As the ladies had now unanimously chosen him to be master of their ceremonies , and director in chief of all their plans  he thought his character at stake , in doing justice to every thing that had been put under his care .
To this end , he flew up from Wales to London , and from London to Paris , and so down again to the Green , with almost incredible rapidity .
And presently after these excursions , we had such waggon and boat-loads full of beautiful bagatelles , which , though they cost the most  serious fums of money , did real honour to the taste of this handsome agent , who had the art of dissipating so very delicately , that every lady protested it would be an honour to leave herself pennyless , rather than damp the superb choice of decorations , which so characterised their favourite .
Can I , dear reader , confess to thee without a fatherly blush , that even the innocent Matilda was quite captivated with the brilliant extravagance of her accomplished Danby .
The fact seems to be , that women are more easily dazzled with the qualities of such men , than they are convinced of their imprudence .
The elegant spirit of a Mr. Danby , though it brings ruin and desolation  along with it , hath I doubt , more charms for the women , than all the punctual precisions of prudence , or the regulations of oeconomy .
Matilda saw in this youth an excellent heart joined to a most amiable form - She saw that every action was animated , and every idea grand .
He had fought  he had conquered in her cause .
The very nature of his rencontre flattered her self-love .
In a word , her object was lovely , and she loved with all her soul .


I was , perhaps , the only person , except the steward ( for Seabrooke became a recluse ) who felt particularly the extraordinary conduct of this gentleman .
Being neither blind to his virtues nor follies , I beheld  with real anxiety the great mixture of good and bad in his character , and wished it were possible to separate them , for unless that could be done I shuddered at the very thought of trusting him with the guardianship of Matilda 's happiness .
His present habit of profusion , countenanced , and even courted as he was to indulge it , would have led him to impoverish a nation instead of a village  and I therefore determined to take some seasonable opportunity to remonstrate with him before it might be too late .

BEING AS GAY AND GALLANT A CHAPTER AS ANY IN THE BOOK .


 SUCH an opportunity as I desired , however , not immediately happening , I was obliged to pospone my intention in regard to Mr. Danby , who , in the mean time , was running the same career , and gathering fame amongst the ladies , in proportion as he squandered their money .
I carry you , reader , from hence , into the midst of things , and desire you will conceive the appearance of Shenstone-Green no longer under the form of  a little circumscribed village , but under that of a town , enriched by a regular Theatre , a regular Pantheon , a regular Masquerade , and a regular Musick-Room .
When all these were fit for exhibition , Mr. Danby , in the triumph of his labours , which were now drawing to a period , gave a very grand ball and supper in the pantheon , by way of celebrating the completion of such a cluster of magnificent projects .
On this occasion I received a card , which invited Seabrooke , Matilda , and myself : but Seabrooke had taken a stroll into the country , and told me he should whistle and wander for some days , so that I had no opportunity of even showing him the note , for he had set  out the morning before , obstinately refusing all attendance , and taking with him one of the volumes of Shenstone , and his hazle walking-stick .
Though I promised myself poor entertainment , Matilda persuaded me to accept the invitation .


There is no splendour of language can over-describe the richness , nor the delicacy of this banquet , which might very properly have been given by any young monarch on his accession to the throne .
You will draw your own inference therefore how far it was consistent with the situation of things at Shenstone-Green !
The goddess of prodigality - if any such there be - seemed to have laid her finger on  every part of the entertainment  and yet Mr. Danby had so contrived the matter as to reconcile avarice himself to the scene , and make it impossible to upbraid .
The ball was opened by Mr. Danby and Matilda , who danced a minute with such inexpressible grace , and so much to the joy and amazement of the whole company , that - pray forgive me , reader - I was quite flattered into an obilvion of consequences , and joined in the pleasures of the evening as heartily as the rest .
Exclusively indeed of the pride of the parent , exulting at the applauses which an only child had very innocently acquired  there were many other things to keep up the gaity of the season ,  and nurse that forgetfulness , which is sometimes so necessary to pleasure .
In about five minutes after my arrival , a noble band of musick put itself in order to play an occasional hymn to gratitude , which was to be sung by the pensioners , and was the production of Mr. Danby .
The turn , the conduct , and the sentiment of this little composition , discovered at once the good heart and fine genius of the author , who , while it was performing , came from his chair , and held over my head a radiant canopy , on which were displayed the figures of Benevolence and Charity .
Next advanced all the female pensioners , adorned with chaplets of roses , and strewed the way for the fair Matilda with  flowers .
Scarce was this ceremony over , before the general joy was yet increased by the appearance of Mr. Edward Elixir , who came into the room by a private folding door , with the machine of his wife , who sat therein like the image of plenty , and was drawn round the room twice in state by the apothecary , who laughed , tagged , and capered incessantly , till he was obliged to draw off the caravan , and go peaceably home to his bed .
But the scene which succeeded this was of such a nature , and contrived with a grace so admirable , that had Mr. Danby ruined the universe that very evening , there are few readers who would not pardon it , in  consideration of what is going to be told them .


Matilda and this young gentleman being engaged in the same plot , which both had projected , and carried on with the utmost secrecy , I was not prepared for the surprize that I felt , on beholding Hackney Oldblade , dressed in a sea-officer 's new uniform , enter the room , between Mr. Henry Hewit on the one hand , and his daughter Fanny , dressed in white , on the other .
They were no sooner come in , than Mr. Danby and Matilda walked up , and began a ceremony which they had prepared .
Immediately the musicians exerted their utmost skill , in doing all possible justice  to a nuptial ode , which Mr. Danby had written , the words of which , were divinely sung by Matilda .
During the ode Mr. Danby spread a white banner before Henry Hewit , while Matilda dispalayed another in honour of Fanny .
Then the wreaths and garlands were entwined round their heads , and a silver label held up to the view , sparkling with the following inscription : The New-married Couple  or , the Celebration of an Union betwixt Honour and Beauty .
While the company were expressing their surprize at this spectacle , in came the reverend Mr. Cusheon ( whose frailty is , I trust , a good natured secret , reader , betwixt me and thee ) .
Mr.  Cusheon paid his compliments to the new-married folks , whom , it seems , he had very lately attended to the altar  and they were then presented to me by my daughter .


Whatever ugly whispers might have gone abroad to poor Fanny 's disadvantage , prior to this circumstance , they were all effectually done away by this generous manoeuvre , insomuch , that all the ladies followed the fair example of Matilda , and the gentlemen took their pattern from my behaviour .


Thus was the deep-wound in the heart of our soldier suddenly healed up , and the honour of his family totally redeemed .


 It is not necessary to enquire , whether this respect to poor Fanny Oldblade was real or affected on the part of the ladies .
We had so absolutely shut the lips of detraction , that the power of her opening them again , maliciously , was taken away  and from that night , this lovely young woman , with honest Henry Hewit , lived the happiest , and perhaps , the most virtuous pair in the precincts of Shenstone-Green .


The evening concluded with a morsel of eloquence , pronounced by Mr. Danby , on the nature of the diversions which were then about to commence , and in this discourse ( which might have graced the mouth of a member of the Belles Lettres , at his  being admitted into the French academy ) our young president showed himself to be as able a reasoner , and as perfect an orator as he was before known to be a man of elegance and dissipation .


At the end of his speech , he adjusted the times and seasons for opening and shutting the places of diversion , and , in short , fixed every thing on a plan , in which would be offered not only the greatest variety , but in which , also , each amusement would be crowned with the eclat of the company .


By such means Mr. Danby made one of the most expensive evening 's pleasure too agreeable to admit the  obtruding idea of what it cost , and , by artfully ornamenting the cause , blinded the spectator , till it was impossible for him to look forward to the effect .

THE GLORY OF SHENSTONE-GREEN PROMISETH TO FADE AWAY .


 THE talisman , however , which bound up our senses , was broken to pieces the very next morning , and the charm was no more .
Stripped of her sparkling decorations , Folly appeared full in view , and Justice ( with scourges in her hand , and terrour in her eye ) pursued her close .


The distress began with the appearance of Mr. Samuel Sarcasm , who gave me a fresh packet of papers .
Every one was of tremendous length ,  and the sum total threatened with bankruptcy or imprisonment .


Upon a stricter scrutiny , they appeared to be a bundle of claims , which were made upon certain of the pensioners for work done , and goods furnished , to the gross amount of many thousand guineas .


But what are these to me , Samuel said I , laying down the papers ?


We will examine first the premises , and then draw our inference , if your Honour pleases , answered Samuel .


Here Samuel put on his spectacles and read aloud .


 The second petition of the female pensioners to their patron , SIR B. BEAUCHAMP .


SHOWETH ,


THAT your petitioners do not at all doubt , but the execution of their several projects ( under the superintendance of D. Danby , Esq ) has been honoured with your warmest approbation .


THAT Shenstone-Green is now so exceedingly crouded with company ( in expectation of the first opening of the diversions ) that , it is with the utmost difficulty either beds or accommodations of any kind can be found  your petitioners observe , moreover , faces and forms moving about of all  sorts , sizes , cuts , and countries , which they take to be so many proofs of the great popularity the Green must already be in .


THAT the uncommon improvements , made within a few months last past , are of such a nature , as must soon give the pattern of perfection to Europe , of which Shenstone-Green will be at once the glory and the surprize  in consequence of which your petitioners , willing to do poetical justice in the fullest degree , earnestly recommend an immediate alteration of the name of their new Paradise .


THAT instead of Shenstone-Green ( which seems only to imply a petty piece of  ground with a few cottages scattering about , and some goslings grazing thereupon ) your petitioners humbly propose it should assume a magnitude of sound agreeable to the pomp it it has received by the labours of your petitioners .
To this end they offer two titles for consideration - namely , Shenstone-City , or the City of Shenstone .


THAT your petitioners beg leave to take down the figure of the late William Shenstone , Esq from a pedestal ( which they conceive disgraces him ) in order to replace a statue to his memory , worthy of such an angel of a man , and to make the City of Shenstone , or Shenstone-City , all of a piece .


 THAT zealous to do every thing which may merit your applause , your petitioners intend ordering their poet to be cast in a mould of solid silver , properly embellished , with the emblem of a large fountain of the same metal , running a stream of gold at the bottom of his feet , to show his unbounded generosity .
Underneath the fountain we propose the following motto , taken ( as Mr. Danby says ) from a contemporary poet : ` Behold , the genial current of his soul . '


THAT your petitioners humbly beg they may be honoured with your image also , which , though already engraven upon the tablet of their hearts , they are ambitious of seeing publickly exhibited  as a new ornament of their city .
They propose to have Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , represented in the attitude of opening his arms wide to the universe , and the following inscriptions on the front of the pedestal :


Come unto me all ye who are heavy laden .
See Beauchamp 's plan unfolds the soul of Shenstone .
THAT filled with the warmest gratitude , which can possibly affect the human heart , your petitioners are not perfectly contented with the simple titles of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , and William Shenstone , Esq but understanding that most of the persons , now canonized , have been sainted for  things of less note than the present magnificent circumstance , they wish the pedestals to signify the following intelligence : For example ,


 SAINT SHENSTONE The Sage , Who wrote out the finest plan for The finest Town in the World .


SAINT BEAUCHAMP The Benevolent , Who built upon the plan of Saint Shenstone A whole City , Which , from a small beginning , arose to be the wonder of the world .
And the whole By the voluntary Bounty of one Man , viz .


SAINT BEAUCHAMP .
`` Large was his bounty , and his soul sincere . ''
These Statues of Solid Silver , Erected by those , whom his Liberality Protected , In the year of their supreme Felicity - and of Our Lord God -


 THAT , lastly , your petitioners , having now completed their views , do subscribe with all their souls to defray the expenses as much as in them lies , and beg Saint Beauchamp will advance ( on the pension of all the females ) the sum of twenty thousand pounds , to be paid back to Saint B. by installments , allowing to the pensioners in the mean while ( by way of annuity ) i. e. to each person , only the neat yearly sum of -


Here I interrupted Mr. Sarcasm , by very vehemently exclaiming - Mighty God , man , why this is downright frenzy - frenzy from the beginning to the end - Twenty thousand pounds quotha ?
-


 Why your Saintship knoweth , answered the steward , that -


A truce with your foolery , Mr. Sarcasm , cried I , again interrupting him , I perceive plainly that too much indulgence hath let loose upon me all the violent passions of human nature .
What , Samuel , dost thou suppose , or do these foolish women suppose , I built me a neighbourhood to bring into it all the vices and luxuries of a large city !
No , Samuel , let them be told that I raised up the walls of my little town to reclaim errour , and protect distress : to fill the forlorn heart with innocent gladness  to conceal the blushes of unpremeditated mistake , and screen from the fury of the world such objects as  were lest defended from its rapacity .
Fie upon them !
They have lost my Paradise already .
Tell them so from me , Samuel .
Tell them they have brought sin and shame into my Eden , and deserve to be driven out like the original offenders .


I will report what your Honour desireth me , said Samuel , putting his spectacles with the most provoking sang-froid into their case , and then walking off .

SOME OF THE FIGURES ON SHENSTONE-GREEN DISAPPEAR .


 IT is incredible to conceive the confusion and the uproar which this angry message produced in the village .
Every creditor was up in arms , and Mr. Danby , the unfortunate president ( who had been the acting member in all the buildings , and their ornaments ) was obliged to take refuge in the house of Hackney Oldblade , who , with sword in hand , guarded him from the threats of the clamourous multitude till midnight .
 Matilda no sooner heard of Danby 's situation , than she fell at my feet , and , ( with an energy which could come only from the heart ) begged that I would sacrifice her thousand pounds a year to a man , whose freedom was much dearer to her than fortune , and which , she said , ought to be purchased with every thing she had in the world .
But , before I had time to answer this extravagant effusion of tenderness , a man appeared on horseback at my door , who presented a letter to the first servant he saw , and then rode off again at full speed .
The epistle was without date , and evidently written by a trembling hand .


 To Sir Benjamin Beauchamp .
At Beauchamp Mansion-House , c. c..


SIR ,


THAT I may not seem as contemptible as prodigal , I catch up a sorry pen , at an inn on the road , to tell you , that I leave Shenstone-Green , more to shun the horrour of appearing again under the just reproaches of your eye , than from any event that could take place to my own personal inconvenience .
I have offended the two only persons whose esteem ought ever to have been most facred - I have offended too myself .
I am ashamed - convinced , and in despair -


D. DANBY .


 Over this letter I hurried my eye and put it into my pocket , to prevent its being discovered by my daughter , who was but too much agitated already .
I promised every thing she wished , and had the good fortune to pacify her so far as to dry her tears , and persuade her to withdraw to her chamber .


Scarce had she retired , when the steward came again to the MansionHouse with new burdens of petition and remonstrance .
The examination of these I would then have avoided upon almost any conditions  but the steward said , the salvation of Shenstome-Green absolutely depended on my giving to every one the most  serious and immediate attention .
Sir , said Samuel , your honour can have no conception of the present state of your village or that of your villagers , unless you will dedicate this whole morning to the full examination of all those parcels now before you .


Alarmed at this intelligence , and still more at the aweful manner by which it was introduced , I sat down tremblingly to the scrutiny .


To particularize the articles contained in this fresh catalogue of follies ( which now extended themselves over the Green would be equally tedious and distressing .
I shall , therefore , for the reader 's peace of mind , compress all the facts together , and offer  him a general idea of the whole , by means of the following abridgements of each address .


FIRST , Several pensioners complained , that , they had been ill-used by their neighbours in points either of fame or fortune , property or character  the consequence of which was , either , that I must openly countenance duels , put the law into every man 's hands , with pistol and poignard , or else I must establish a Court of Justice , in which causes should be heard and crimes punished .
SECONDLY , That the spirit of private gaming had arisen to so fatal an excess in Shenstone-Green , that , most of the  pensioners had caught the contagion , and some had even mortgaged their annuities to a fellow who purchased lives , and enriched himself by impoverishing others  so that all the practises of Change alley had travelled down to Whenstone-Green .
THIRDLY , Bailiffs and their attendants were busy in every quarter of Shenstone-Green , to serve their special originals and their running writs upon the bodies of insolvent pensioners  so that officers of justice picked a very pretty fortune out of the pockets of the Shenstonians .
FOURTHLY , Executions were laid on several houses by some , who imagined furniture  might supply the want of ready money .
FIFTHLY , The actors , fiddlers , c. finding their hopes thus blasted all at once , walked over the Green , in a solitary manner , and at length took themselves away , very heartily cursing Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , and William Shenstone , Esq as two silly fellows , whom they thought to be utterly ignorant in the ways of the world , and who had vainly attempted to subvert civil government , by realizing a parcel of incoherent chimeras too ridiculous even for blank verse , or ten syllable rhyme .
Shenstone-Green was looked on , by the gentry , as the greatest farce that ever was acted and - DAMN'D .
 SIXTHLY .
One of the pensioners  to wit - Alexander Spur , Esq having sold his annuity and spent all the profits , very naturally rode his own horse Shenstone , on the Welch road , where , by very uncommon chance , he met a rich person , of whom he borrowed two hundred and ten pounds rather against the rich person 's will , which occasioned his being pursued and overtaken just as he was putting poor Shenstone into the stable : so it was very soon expected , that , on this sweet Paradise of a Green , a gallows would be erected for the use , first of Mr. Alexander Spur , and then for the other pensioners as occasion offered .
 SEVENTHLY .
The ladies of pleasure ( who formerly had the too great honour to associate with the lovely Fanny Old-blade , now Mrs. Hewit ) finding every thing in their way gone to wrack and ruin , had returned to London to their several Padding-places in the most notorious parts of that city , where they entertain all their friends with the merry and mournful History of Shenstone-Green  a scheme , which did not take .
EIGHTLY .
Several petitions appeared very regularly drawn out by an attorney , who , it seems , found his presence more necessary at Shenstone-Green than in Chancery-lane .
Amongst other  things appeared the following proposals : For converting the Pantheon into a court of Equity .
- The Concert Room into a Court of Conscience .


- The Masquerade-Hall , into Dr. Commons , and - The Theatre into a Court of King 's - Bench .


From the above account it appeared so evidently , my whole project was a mere castle in the air that I was quite dispirited .
Then there is not a folly of any kind , Samuel , said I , which does not at this time flourish upon Shenstone-Green .
Pray , Samuel , what  is your opinion of all these fine doings ?


That it is the History of poor Human Nature spoiled by human art , when both are left at large to their own inventions , a n't please your Honour , said the steward .


But my village , Mr. Sarcasm , is ten times worse than any other spot in Christendom .


Because , a n't please your Honour , every other spot in Christendom but your village , is regulated by laws penal  whereas , Shenstone-Green is builded and conducted wholly upon a poetical model .
Your 's , sir , is fairy land  we are obliged to go to the next town for justice .


 Here the sudden entrance of one of the pensioners ( who delivered me a petition on his knee with a grave air , and then withdrew ) put a stop to the steward 's observations .

XLIX .
AN ACADEMY OF DISPUTE IS ESTABLISHED ON SHENSTONE-GREEN .


 THE petition now brought was , in effect , to the follow purpose , viz .


THAT a society of pensioners accustomed to publick disputation , and to speak their sentiments on important subjects , found themselves so incapable of relishing the frivolity and froth of those other pensioners ( who were attracted only by gewgaw and glitter ) that they found the time insufferably long upon Shenstone-Green .


 THAT in order to compensate for this dearth of intellectual entertainment , they proposed ( with my permission ) to institute an Academy of Dispute , where science and the belles lettres , and morality , were to be debated , encouraged , and cultivated .


THAT no expence whatever should attend the prosecution of this project , except that of fitting up a few benches or forms for the audience , and a rostrum for the president , who was , of course , to be Sir Benjamin Beauchamp .


This matter seemed to me , in comparison with others , which had been received , so exceedingly innocent and rational , that I wrote a grant without  hesitation , and ordered the steward himself to deliver it to the learned body of my pensioners , with the best respects of their patron .

THE WHISTLER EXALTS HIS VOICE IN THIS CHAPTER .


 THE steward had scarcely stepped over the threshold , when my old and excellent friend Mr. Seabrooke ( besprent with dust , and burnished by the tan of that sun , upon which he so much doated ) made his appearance .


I ran to him with that ardour , which denotes an affection founded upon a long experience of admirable qualities - qualities which his innocent  oddities served only to render the more endearing .


He shook me heartily by the hand , and then whistled his loudest note to summon Matilda , who , however , was indisposed in her chamber  she was indeed , too ill to stir from her apartment  so , without any more ceremony , Seabrooke took two or three strides up the stairs , and was soon dandling his little favourite in his arms , and asking all the tender questions that could possibly come from a man of his tenderness .


But Matilda came and asked me softly , if Mr. Danby was at liberty ?


 I said ( in the same under-tone of voice ) that , he was : upon which the poor girl caught such spirits , that she ran to Seabrooke , and chided him for his cruel excursion , at a time too , said she , when I wanted my old playfellow more than ever I did in my life  and such sunny weather too !


Then let us have all our different adventures , since parting , related over a dish of good tea , said Seabrooke .
Whew - quick - Whew -


In the bow-window if you please , papa , which looks towards Shenstone-Green  because then , you know , if any person should happen to come , we shall all be ready to receive him , and fetch a cup in a moment .


 The idea of Danby 's freedom , had so well recovered her , that she tripped down stairs as agil as a hare , and the tea-equipage was prepared without delay .


I took the lead in the present conversation , and circumstantially related ( without any other reserve than that of concealing Mr. Danby 's name ) every transaction that had passed since , Mr. Seabrooke set off on his ramble .


At the close of this lamentable account , Seabrooke gave a long whistle , and said , with an emphasis highly marked that , he was now convinced of what he had before suspected .
Whew - said he , - 't is now clear : 't is absolute sunshine .


 I desired the assistance of his friendship , showing , very pathetically ( by a fear which then flowed from my heart to his hand , that I was as deeply affected as deceived ) .


Matilda ran softly on the opposite side to kiss my cheek , and Mr. Seabrooke addressed me thus : Sir Benjamin Beauchamp , you are , I find , a man to be looked at , but not followed .
As soon as I heard of your project , I came to see how human nature would behave , under the execution of such a whim .
In Glamorganshire ( said I to myself , upon reading your plan ) resides a man whom I would travel seven times seven over the Alps , in the dead of winter to  know : his heart must be the noblest in the world .
Accordingly , I travelled on foot to Shenstone-Green , where , I found your disposition even greater than I imagined , and I resolved to pass some time with you in Paradise .
But a very few days elapsed before I was obliged to stretch myself on the grass-plats in the eye of the sun , that I might not see too much of my fellow-creatures .
I every hour remarked that modern man , without the rod often snaken over his head , and the whip smacked in his ear , was as an horse of spirit without any bridle .
The poor animals whom - to carry on the allusion - you had taken from the barren heath ( where they were starving upon thistles ) to place , of a  sudden , in the luxuriant pasture , where the corn and grass came mantling to their chests - were turned too rapidly loose to become steady .
They first grew fat , then indolent , next restive , and last vicious .
I heard them snort disdain  and I saw them lift the hoof against the very benefactor , who put on their shoes , and gave the vigour to kick .
Yet I pitied rather than blamed : I considered whether this was pure baseness , or the inevitable consequence of situation , operating on peculiar temperament and character .
- Too happy creatures said I , are these steeds of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp  for which reason they must soon be too miserable .


 Had they been timely broken to the bit , and taught an early obedience to the curb : had they been put into proper training , there is no motive to suppose they would not have been most of them serviceable animals - and -


Does nothing then but rigid discipline create virtue , said I , Mr. Seabrooke ?


No , replied Seabrooke , discipline hath no influence over Henry Hewit , Hackney .
Oldblade , Matilda Beauchamp , nor some other persons of our acquaintance .
Good and gentle characters , require no other impulse to virtue than the dictate of the heart , which is their unerring rule of right   but the majority , being neither gentle not good  it is necessary to prevent the force of bad habit or bad nature , by the interposition of wholesome laws .
But in Shenstone-Green , none of these could be established consistently with the proprietor 's delicacy .


You have seen , you have felt the consequence , Sir Benjamin .


I sighed bitterly in echo to a sigh from Matilda , and then , Mr. Seabrooke continued .

CHAP .

IN WHICH THE WHISLER 'S PIPE IS PARTICULARLY IN TUNE .


 HURT , and disgusted with seeing how impossible it is to leave human beings to their own discretion , in the present state of society , and really concerned so early to perceive , the absolute madness of establishing a system of pure obligation and benevolence on the one hand , and of gratitude on the other , I wanted yet to try , if there was no way for a man to be liberal without doing at the same  time as much harm as good .
Two or three days did I contemplate this subject , as I lay in the sun upon your grass-plats , my friend  and , at length , an idea came across , which set me upon my legs to some purpose : for , I have measured near sixty miles , in my sauntering way , Sir Benjamin , since I left the Mansion-house , and now I am returned thoroughly satisfied , that I can oppose our friend Shenstone in every part of his scheme .
Nay I am , at this time , able to set one of his observations against another .
Pray compare that notion of his from whence you took your hint , and which was , indeed , the foundation of the village , with what follows :  ' I have been formerly so silly as to hope ( says our poet in one of his egotisms ) that every servant I had might be made a friend  I am now convinced , that the nature of servitude bears a contrary tendency .
It is the nature of servitude also , to discard all generous motives to obedience  and to point out no other , than those scoundrel ones of interest and fear . '


Now , take my word for it , continued , Mr. Seabrooke , that , all pensions upon the Shenstone principle , are too generously and too largely bestowed , not to reduce the person thereby benefitted to a state of slavery and obligation , which ( unless such person  happens to have the heart of a Henry Hewit ) must , of necessity , introduce idleness , which will beget voluptuousness , which will terminate in vice .


Had we been convinced of these facts some time ago , Mr. Seabrooke , said I , how many pangs of heart , as well as purses of solid gold might have been spared .


I was not clear in the point myself , answered Seabrooke , till I had more particularly proved it in my late excursion  of which I will now give you and Matilda an account .
He paused , and then went on .


As I grasped my hazle-stick on the morning of my departure , surely , said  I , it is possible for a man to be at once wise and generous .
Let us see .
To this purpose , I bent my way over the mountains , resolved to stop at every hut or hamlet that should rise up in the road .
My scheme was to do what , I fear , the Shenstonian plan does not permit - namely , to try the worth of my object before I administred relief .
Pigmy as I am , I stood upon the galled shoulders of that giant of generosity , Sir Benjamin , and so saw farther .
To forward this my stratagem , I tore off a corner of my hat , as you see , to make myself look properly miserable  I cut a couple of slits in my shoes , picked a few holes in the most obvious parts of my coat ,  taking care that the buttons should , in several places be wanting - because there is nothing more denotes penury , than the disappearance of a button , particularly , if the old threads are suffered to hang about - and shaking the powder out of my wig ( which you know has not been acquainted with combs , since I came into your poetical country ) sallied into the poorest part of Wales , under pretence of being the poorest fellow in it .
Thus accoutered , I entered every cottage , whose mud walls were either bleaching on the hills , or skulking amongst the vallies .
I knocked without ceremony at every door , and often let myself in by means of a latch .
Without the least ceremony I took a  chair , or ( if chairs were scarce ) a stool , and set myself down with the family .
If they were at dinner , I dined also  if they were at work , I joined in the bustle , and would take mop or broom out of the damsel 's hand without saying a syllable .
You know , Matilda , what a proud odd sort of saucy beggar I am .
It will be impossible to tell you half the singular events , which trod upon the heel of this singular conduct .
- Some thought I was mad , others merry .
Some believed I was a conjurer , others an impostor .
What of that , I had my plan before me , and I pursued it without deviation .
Whether I was well or ill treated , I stayed always long enough to find out the history  of the hut  its misfortunes , its prosperities .
Hence , the characters of the present possessors were developed of course .
Sometimes I have entered a wretched-looked cottage ( where penury seemed to sit staring in a useless chimney-corner without a faggot to call the blood into her fingers ) and I have , on enquiry , found , the inhabitants so rich in content , that I dared not venture to leave with them more than half a crown or at most five shillings , for fear I should overwhelm them with sudden independence , and so ruin the family .
Had I left a whole guinea in such a hut , the prosperity would have been so great , that four girls who were then singing at their wheels , would not  have returned to spinning till idleness and dissipation had made them almost forget how to wind the wool round their lazy fingers .
At other times I have gone into a house , where , by the diligence of the cottagers , all sorts of penury seemed to be banished  where the floor was nicely sanded , the pewter shone like mirrours , and the goodly rows of crockery , mended at top and bottom , garnished the chimney-piece  and yet , before I took my leave , I have found the family so truly poor , and so absolutely prudent , that it might be trusted with the enormous sum of five pounds , although it came pouring upon them in a sudden shower of gold .
Such a sum did I give to such a family , Sir Benjamin , and  what reason have I ( more than you yet know ) think you , to assure myself my bounty was well-placed ?
Why , you shall hear .
I took out the money just after we had been banquetting on some excellent potatoes without butter , and as soon as I had told the five pounds - guineas , in fact , I ought to say - here ( said I , to a good woman who sat opposite ) these are to pay you for some of the best potatoes dressed in the nicest way , and served up in the cleanest manner I ever saw .
As I chucked the cash across the table , one of the guineas tumbled on a farthing platter and broke it in two .
After curtesying , many times too often , and putting the money into her pocket , she gave  the broken plate to her husband and said - here Robin - a farthing is a farthing , and the good gentleman has - God bless him - given us five guineas  that is no reason why we should grow more extravagant than usual , so pray , Robin , mend the platter .
This , Robin , who was the family mechanick , did in a very little time  and at night it bore the weight of the potatoes , warmed up a second time , as well as ever .
I must not forget to tell you , though , that sometimes I have made my passage into huts , through all the sauciness and brutality that was ever practised , even by the pampered children of Shenstone-Creen .
I have met fellows that would neither suffer me to sit upon stool or chair   who have opposed my entering into any conversation , and refused to give me a crust when I affected to be in the misery which my appearance justified .
But , having authority in my hand , I always in such cases , i. e , after I found them reprobate - put my hand quietly into my pocket , and then took from my purse eight or ten guineas under pretence of wanting change : then , having thoroughly opened every mouth with wonder , and silenced every tongue with shame , I was generous enough to give the ungrateful rascals a WHISTLE and set off for fresh adventures .


Matilda here leaped on Mr. Seabrooke 's knee , and kissed him with all her heart .


 Mr. Elixir ( whom I forgot to tell the reader , had come into the room just as the tea-kettle was brought ) cried , laughed , skipped , and bounded at Mr. Seabrooke 's relation .


For my own part , I held my tongue and spake nothing .

WHEREIN THE TONES OF THE WHISTLER GO THRILLING THROUGH THE HEART .


 THUS , continued Mr. Seabrooke , have I proved my fellow-creatures before I trusted them .


Would to God , Mr. Seabrooke , I had done the same .


Let me see , here is my note-book , answered Seabrooke , taking a sheet of paper folded in the form of a memorandum-book , out of which , he read as follows : ` Charges of Mr. Seabrooke during his journey over some of the  Welch mountains performed on foot . '


Two couples made happy for life with the sum of # .
s. d. 17 14 8 N. B. Three pounds more would have ruined both families .


To four spinners - # .
s. d. 0 4 0 To a deaf hedger - # .
s. d. 0 15 0 N. B. Found the hedger whistling in a ditch at his work : but the sum made him grave , and so he left off whistling .
The gift should not have exceeded 1s .
6d .
which would have made him whistle louder than before .
This , however ,  was the only extravagance I committed in my whole journey  but , alas !
the hedger was at the ale-house for three days and nights .
I am always partial to WHISTLERS .


To setting up a young man with four sheep , two hogs , a horse , a cart and a cow .
- # .
s. d. 2500 N. B. Very sober and going to be married to a young woman who has a fortune of twenty guineas .
The girl 's father refused his consent before , but  he is now thought a very good match .


To a woman who was prudent enough to mend her farthing platter just after she had received five guineas as a present .
- # .
s. d. 550 To a traveller who gave me the largest half of an oaten cake as I sat by the road side , and brought me some spring water in his hat .
- # .
s. d. 100 N. B. All in crown pieces because I wished him to have the largest money I had about me .


 To an odd little man with whom I walked near three miles , because he said he was richer than me , after I had pulled out my purse and showed him the contents .
# .
s. d. 100 N. B .
This creature turned out the linings of his pockets and dropped on the ground only two six-pences .
He said he was always poor when he had money , and rich when he had none  for I drink like a fish , sir , said he , and you have put me as it were into the mouth of a mug for at least a week .
Yes , yes , continued he , with a good many jokes and stories ( looking at the guinea ) you will last for a week .
But come , sir , as you did  not give it me to make a beast , I will e ` en make a man of myself .
As he said this we were just entering a Welch town , where seeing a second-hand suit of clothes that hit his fancy hanging at a shop , he struck his bargain , and laid out his whole guinea .
The first prudent thing I ever did in my life , sir , ( said he , tucking the clothes into his bundle ) pray God no ill luck may come out , but I have not let you put your money to a bad use , which is the case but with too many worthy gentlemen , and so here I go with my guinea over my shoulder and my two six-pences in my pocket .


 To a stout blade who triumphantly compared his hands with mine , and swore I had too fair a fist to have done much for my livelyhood , alledging , ledging , that , it was no wonder I was a beggar , and be cursed to me .
# .
s. d. 0 10 6 To a little girl , who , as I I sat on a joint stool , darned a hole in my stocking , and cut smooth the torn corner of my hat without being asked .
# .
s. d. 006 To another who amused herself with making my coat still more ragged and buttonless .
- A box on the ear .
 To a multitude of saucy folks who insulted me divers ways , and who would have starved me when they thought me penniless , and gorged me when they perceived I had money A WHISTLE EACH .
Whew - said Mr. Elixir .
Oh !
Jesus , how I should like to whistle after the manner of Mr. Seabrooke !
How monstrously I should like to whistle !

A MORE INTERESTING DISCOVERY THAN COULD BE IMAGINED .


 FROM this account Mr. Seabrooke , said I , it appears that , with the small sum of one year 's payment of your pension - nay , scarce the half of it , you have done more rational and more real service to society than poor silly Sir Benjamin Beauchamp with all his thousand pounds , and fair snow of Shenstonian houses and the annuity settled upon their inhabitants .


 Before any answer or remark could be made upon this reflexion , a servant opened the door of our apartment , to introduce , under cover of the night ( which was then come on ) assisted by a disguise , a man who fell at my feet the moment he could reach me .


Sir , said the disguised person , I can not rest till I have personally demanded pardon for the -


Gracious Providence , exclaimed Seabrooke , in the most violent emotion - that voice should belong to -


Mr. Danby - cried Matilda .


Danby - answered Seabrooke with perfect amazement - yes - it may be so - that may perhaps be the name which -


 I have taken upon me ( said the man ) to conceal the faults which disgraced the family of -


Whom !
( cried Seabrooke , staggering against the wainscot ) the family of whom ?
-


Of Sir Matthew Davies , replied the gentleman , unmuffling his face , and discovering Mr. Danby .


My nephew here , cried Seabrooke , by what accident is he arisen from the dead ?


The dead !
said I .


Your nephew !
Mr. Seabrooke , demanded Matilda ?
Your nephew , Mr. Seabrooke , did you say ?


 Call me not Seabrooke any more , madam  I am that unhappy Sir Matthew Davies , who fed and nursed that fictitious Danby upon my knee , when his parents were in their graves  but his extravagant benevolence drove him from my arms to some foreign shore , where it was afterwards reported he died .
Speak , Danvers Davies , am I not relating facts ?


They are too true , answered the young man  I had committed excesses which I deemed impossible for you to forgive , and , that I might never be thought of more , determined to abscond for ever , and feigned myself dead .


Since which time , I suppose , said Sir Matthew , you have been more prudent .


 Not a whit , sir , replied young Davies .
This gentleman can tell you that I have been the most prodigal , most thoughtless -


Fie !
sir , said Matilda half drowned in her tears , it 's no such thing .


This gentleman 's bounty , sir , found me in the retreat I had sought to hide myself , and he took me under his protection upon the credit of some good feelings , and in pity to many weaknesses .
But scarce was I put into Paradise before my unfortunate passions -


Lookee , Danvers , answered Sir Matthew , that you are a mixture of weeds and flowers I do not want to be told  nor do I desire to hear the history  of half the mad things you have committed , or by what multiplied stratagems you have sheltered yourself from my enquiry , since you parted six years ago from my house , I shall only tell you that I have thought about you as seldom as my heart would let me , and that now you appear unexpectedly before me , the weak part of my nature is too much melted to do any thing worse than shed over you the tears of pity and affection .


The uncle and nephew were weeping in the neck of each other .


The disordered and half-dying Matilda ran into her father 's arms for that consolation , which he had not the power to give her .


 The apothecary threw himself across two chairs , and sobbed with sorrow and joy .


I felt a mixture of sensations , of which , if the reader would wish to gain the true idea  it is necessary that he has been at some period of his life , in the same instant , inexpressibly wretched and inexpressibly happy .


It was such a transaction as the tender heart would neither seek when unoffered , nor reject when it came .

ESSENTIAL MATTERS .


 WHEN it was possible to speak again , I related to Sir Matthew all the fair parts of his nephew 's character , since he came to Shenstone-Green  and observed that the other side of his picture was only too bright to be looked at .


Yes , papa , said Matilda , that is all the fault he has .


And what can be done , poor fool ( said Sir Matthew , taking his nephew by the hand ) to make it an honest lad  and less of a simpleton ?
But , between ourselves , Sir Benjamin , your 's was the very worst school this young fellow could have gone to .
He never could help wanderings of the imagination before , and here you , and your Mr. Shenstone , bring him to a place where there in nothing but generous chimeras from one end of the village to the other .
Why you , Sir Benjamin , and my nephew , would , in conjunction , ruin any set of people in the world ?
Whew , a thousand pounds are gone out of your hands to do nothing at all effectually  while I am absolutely contriving to spend about an hundred guineas to make the best part of half a dozen villages perfectly rich and happy .
Whew - money is a mere  jack o ' th ' lanthern , in your hands .
It is dancing about in a fascinating manner , and is nothing but a sparkling vapour , which may bring those who are lighted by it into a hole , after all .
But , no matter , I have a cure for all yet .
Tremble , nephew , I have a cure for all yet .


During this whole scene , young Davies , the nephew , behaved with a contrition so sincere and so modest , yet so perfect a sense of his impropriety that I never saw him so truly to advantage  and it plainly appeared by every look and action of Matilda , that , with all his errours , he was more beloved by his mistress than ever .


 But the mystery of the travelling Mr. Seabrooke , who was so suddenly metamorphosed into Sir Matthew Davies , the real uncle of the imagined Mr. Danby , sat still uneasy on my mind , till Sir Matthew himself cleared up the whole extraordinary affair , by first writing and then disclosing to me the following letter : which was addressed to the very friend who had recommended him to me .


 To P. PECKHAM , Esq


DEAR PECKHAM ,


OUR stratagem has been successful as far as has been necessary , and I have passed upon your friend Benjamin , as Seabrooke the bankrupt and beggar , till this very day .
All my curiosity hath been abundantly satisfied , and ( by means of my plot ) in my own way  but within these four hours have fallen out two very extraordinary revolutions , which will not easily get from the memory .
First , I have seen that a village built upon poetical principles will never stand the batter of the passions , which you know blows an hard gale  from every corner  and , Secondly , I shall ever have reason to bless the name of the dear chimerical SHENSTONE , who hath been the means of restoring to me that young rake of a nephew whom we thought dead .
By some quondam interest or other he got in his name , or rather his name NOMINAL , for the pension  and , it seems , he has contributed very liberally towards bringing all manner of those ministers upon the Green , which are necessary to create fear and fair-dealing .
But the boy has a fine soul , and I believe is so thoroughly ashamed of himself that he may yet come to something .
If he does not , I shall whistle him off with a Whew .
I  now wish you would write an account of my affairs in London just as they really are  for the mask of Seabrooke is taken off from this moment  and I have some masterstrokes to strike in the character of


Your ever sincere friend , MATTHEW DAVIES .


Shenstone-Folly .
P. S .
The reports transmitted from Shenstone-Green to the Mansion-house , were , in general , so different from what a theoretic head and heated heart might be led to imagine , that I have not set my foot in the village more than four or five times  and have , indeed , chiefly led the life of a recluse .
Had it not been for  our patron 's daughter - a warm sun , a couple of excellent garden grassplats , and my consolitary whistle , I should have dropped my purpose long ago .
Never build a Shenstone-Green , Peckham .
Send me something to put on .
I have some of the old suits still .


Having by order of Sir Matthew , read this epistle aloud , he desired Matilda and his nephew to amuse themselves in the garden till he spoke in private to me .

IN THE PARADISE OF SHENSTONE-GREEN , THE WEEDS SHOOT UP APACE .


 WHEN these young folks were retired - to do which required much aukward and delicate difficulty - Sir Matthew took hold of my hand , and exclaimed aloud - Lookee , Sir Benjamin , I see plainly the design which your daughter has upon my nephew .
The point has been palpable ever since I found out the young rascal .
But 't is a match I do not approve , and if you please I will tell  you why - However , let them play their little tricks upon one another for the present , and in a day or two I will settle their love story , I warrant .
The first matter is , the mischief which my young rake-shame had done in the village  let us see how that matter stands .


I was about to reply to all the articles of this peculiar address , when the apothecary cried out , here is worthy Mr. Sarcasm coming into the court-yard .
Now for some news  here re-entered Matilda and Sir Matthew 's nephew , both blushing rosy red .


I have the honour to wait upon you at this time , upon sundry businesses  ( said Samuel , as he bowed in his methodical manner to the company ) .
Imprimis , you must know that the builders and fitters-up of the several houses of amusement have consented to take them into their own hands  partly , indeed , because most of the pensioners concerned therein have betaken themselves to flight  and the said builders and co. do intend speedily advertising the same for SALE BY AUCTION .


And I will be a bidder , cried Sir Matthew .
Samuel smiled upon the imagined Seabrooke , and went on .


Secondly , there are about thirteen houses vacated , which naturally drop  to my honoured master , Sir Benjamin Beauchamp .


Excellent , cried Sir Matthew , that is the most promising news I have heard yet .
Those houses for the future shall be more prudently occupied .


Mr. Samuel gave a second look at the supposed Seabrooke , and proceeded .


Thirdly , Mr. Hackney Old blade the lame soldier ( lately preferred by your Honour ) in conjunction with Mr. Henry Hewit , and Squire Sidney , have dipped their pensions pretty deep to do an action which seemed wise in their eyes though it seemed otherwise in mine .


 To wit , they have paid off certain claims made by the real creditors of the young gentleman , whom , if mine eyes fail me not , sitteth now by the side of that young lady .


My claims , Mr. Sarcasm , did you say , ( answered young Davies rising ) my claims ?


In troth , sir , rejoined Samuel , they were just debts , and would have gone abroad to your disadvantage , so the above gentlemen have bought up your character with the best part of their annuities .


Whew , said Sir Matthew , there 's for you !
Yet do they pretend , that you have still the balance on your side - Now how far that is really the case is -


 Hush - hush - cried young Davies .


As to that , sir , continued Samuel , it is fit that every gentleman should have his due , and as you have a sort of character that can not be hurt by telling the good with the - the - the not quite so good , I should humbly conceive -


Hush I say , replied Davies , if you go on , I must absolutely leave the room .


Lord , how strange you are Danby ( I should say Davies ) said Matilda - pray , Mr. Sarcasm , tell every syllable that you know to his advantage , and I will bear you harmless .


 Pshaw , cried Sir Matthew , we all know that my nephew has gold amongst his dross , so drop that subject and get on to another Samuel .


The steward pricked up his ears at the word nephew , and gave Sir Matthew a third glance before he went on .


In the next place , sir , said Samuel addressing himself to me , I have to acquaint your Honour , as in duty bound , of a very long and ill-written petition ( that I have received from the Shenstonian mechanicks ) which in substance is - for I would not vex your Honour with seven sheets full of nonsense -


 That , as your Honour has suffered Shenstone-Green to be turned upside down by the whims of the independent pensioners , they think you will not object to a very reasonable proposition which they have to make , viz .


That you will humbly please to put them upon a par with those other Shenstonians , who have done nothing for their money  and fix some annual stipend to each trader independent of the drudgery of business - labour , they say , is no inheritance , and they pretend that in a republick , like that of Shenstone-Green , all should be upon an equality .
Not , that they lay particular stress upon this , your Honour - Not that they will refuse to stick  the knife into the throat of the lamb , nor put the dough into the oven , nor hew the wood , nor fetch the water , any more than when their livelyhood wholly depended upon these occupations , but because , seeing things take rather a curious turn , they suppose they have a natural right to join the chorus of that emulation which seems to be the grand passion of the good people of your Honour 's Green .
Upon this principle - which your Honour will allow is still poor Human Nature - they pray for the sinecure of a pension or annuity , exclusive of the mere profits of selling their commodities  by which indeed it doth already appear , that they can not get so comfortable a subsistence as might be expected   since the better sort of pensioners let their accounts with tradesmen run to a GENTEEL SIZE , and , in the hurry of quitting a Paradise of which they are tired , have , by mistake , forgotten to settle them .


Tradesmen , said Sir Matthew , have as good a title to take advantage of your incaution as any other people for ought I see .
What a lesson for you , Danvers !
continued he .
What an example !
See Danvers the noble pile in ruins !
See Shenstone-Green a mere town of the world .
See the utility of laws , and weep to think what a wild colt is a man when he but imagines himself wholly his own master .


 Samuel now looked more earnestly than before , and could not help saying jocularly , that the gentleman had , in his opinion , wonderfully improved upon his Whew .


Sarcasm , Sarcasm , said I , there wanted but this stroke of the tradesmen to finish the whole .
Putting all things together then Sir Matthew .
-


SIR MATTHEW , cried the steward !


Putting , I say , my dear Sir Matthew , all things together , it is clearly proved , that the only reasonable address which has been made to my bounty hath come from the pensioners who are now instituting the academy of dispute .


WHEW - said Sir Matthew .


 Odso , answered Samuel , I have a card to deliver your Honour from the gentlemen concerned in that matter .
Here it is .


The scientific society of Shenstonian academicians ( who have been indefatigably labouring to sweeten the village by some rational and solid pleasures ) have now brought their scheme to such perfection that tomorrow evening their Athenian entertainments will be opened on the publick , at half past six o'clock .
The business of the first night , which can only be a sort of general introduction , will be for every member to state his principles and sentiments upon the noblest of all subjects - namely , that of RELIGION  because as  our motto is `` Be ye of one Mind , '' it is thought proper only to adopt such into the society as are steady in their faith , and distinguished by their good works .
This society being for universal good , every body both in and out of the village will be admitted , at least for that night , and every man will have full liberty to utter his whole heart whatever be its bias or its prepossession .


Sir B. Beauchamp and his family are most humbly invited to partake this attick gratification , which , it is expected , will reclaim the unhappy disturbances lately created , and give a new form to the village .

WHICH CARRIES ON THE PLOT TO THE READER 'S SATISFACTION .


 MR. Elixir and Samuel were sent away with my compliments to the academicians , letting them know , that I and my party would certainly wait upon them at the time appointed .


When these men had left the room , Sir Matthew Davies turned about to his nephew , and , in the presence of Matilda , spoke thus - Lookee , Danvers , I see your design is to get the affections of that young lady  now I  must honestly tell you , that I love her myself  and though I am ten years , or perhaps fifteen , too old for her , yet I have cherished serious thoughts of asking her to be my wife .
Now , this is to give you notice that I shall most formidably stand between you and the accomplishment of your wishes - Nay , I shall very solemnly be your rival , till by a course of rational conduct you have got better arguments on your side to supplant me than a fair face and the prime of your youth .


Do not think , young gentleman , that such a girl as Matilda is to be thrown away upon a fellow who has already contributed , not a little , to aid her father in squandering her natural  inheritance .
I say , do n't you think this  for be assured -


Dear , sir , answered the beautiful youth with the tears shining in his eyes - dear uncle , if you could see now into my converted heart - if -


It is too early to make professions , replied Sir Matthew in the same commanding tone .
I had rather look at your heart than hear your words .
I make you a very generous offer .
I will sacrifice my affection to your 's when it is clear to the lady 's father that you deserve the preference .
That may easily be Danvers , for you have only to check your vile passion for magnificence , and you will be just  what you ought to be for my little play-mate there .


Indeed , Sir Matthew , cried Matilda , running to his knee as usual , I so well know the goodness of his heart - that -


Hush - Whew - hush , hussey - said the baronet .
He knows the conditions .
Let him consider them .
So now go and tell him from me , that he is a very handsome fellow , and that though he is my rival , I will neither run him through the body nor blow out his brains .


Here the good heart of Sir Matthew melted as he spoke , and he ran into his nephew 's arms , begging him for  God 's sake to make Matilda amends for having fooled away so much of her fortune .
I take all this pains with thee , Danvers , said Sir Matthew , tenderly taking his hand , because thee hast a heart .
But I oppress thee , poor fellow , go then , go , and let Matilda - What do you say though to this freedom , Sir Benjamin ?


I say , Sir Matthew , said I , that we have tortuned them enough and can not do better than leave them together till they recover themselves .


Aye , replied the baronet , I see plainly that you are all in a plot against poor Seabrooke .
I shall be thrown out of my chance , and the  young rogue will run away with his uncle 's mistress at last .


Sir Matthew gave me his hand , and we went out of the room tenderly admiring and esteeming one another .

THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOOLS .


 AGREEABLE to promise we all went at the appointed hour to the Scientifick Society , which was held in the room that had been intended for masquerading .
I was mightily pleased at the pomp with which I was serenaded from the door to the chair of state , which was emblematically decorated , and on which I was seated as President .
Every thing was neat , clean and had methought an air truely classical .
A paper was given  me which contained a list of those gentlemen 's names who designed to speak that evening  and as the opening of the entertainment was a kind of present made to the publick , it is easy to conceive what a multitude of people were collected .
A person appointed to the office of announcing the business now read aloud ( in a tone like the clerk of the papers in a court of justice ) the following notice .


' O YES , this is to give notice , that all philosophers , divines and moralists , who have any questions to propose , or subjects to start , which may tend to the enlargement of human knowledge , are now desired to propose and start them  freely , and such as are deemed worthy of discussion shall be enrolled by the deputy in the repository or register of the society for future debate and elucidation : this being the business of the present evening . '


A general hum murmured through the assembly after the clerk had whined out this notice , and then a bell rang to inform the audience that such as chose to speak might begin and address the President .
In consequence of which I was spoken to in the following manner , while a man on the left hand side was taking his minutes of what past .


 I am one of those very poor creatures called a man , Mr. President ( said the first person that got upon his legs ) I was born without power , knowledge , or instinct  I wanted force and cunning to get the nipple of my mother 's bosom into my mouth , and without assistance I must have died for want of suck , though the milk was full in my view .
I grew higher and stronger till I was twenty-two years old , and I got into my head new ideas every day .
At twenty-two years old , my reason became so strong that I set myself at work to find out the mechanick power or natural stimulus - or what you will - by which I was able to gather so many ideas and so much strength of body ?
Thirty years have  been passed , Mr. President , in this important study , and I am as ignorant upon the subject as if I were yet in my swathing clothes .
I beg , therefore , this matter may be registered for the future consideration of this learned society .


Registered .


He sat down and gave place to


PHILOSOPHER THE SECOND .


I shall only trouble you with a single sentence , Mr. President , namely , that I may be informed , when the society have leisure - What I am ?
From whence I came - What the duce I came for - and what is to become of me when I am not permitted to stay here any longer ?


Registered .


 PHILOSOPHER THE THIRD .


Pray , Mr. President , let me be informed how it is that I am able to think ?


Registered .


PHILOSOPHER THE FOURTH .


I am a philosopher upon the principle of the profound yet modest Mr. Locke , and I should be glad to hear any man , Mr. President , in this assembly have the hardy-hood to oppose his system .
I say , Mr. President , with Mr. Locke , that I have always existed , that there are no such innate ideas - that I am free when I am able to act as I think proper - In short , I am a Lockist from top to bottom .


Registered .


 PHILOSOPHER THE FIFTH .


Register me , Mr. President , if you please as a friend to Spinosa , and an enemy to every man who can support the futile arguments of Locke .


Registered .


PHILOSOPHER THE SIXTH .


My notion is , Mr. President , that the sublimest system in the world is that of the Bramins .
I believe , implicitly with them , that this wretched existence is only a death of a few years , which when passed , will be exchanged for a glorious state where we shall live for ever with the Deity .
Mr. President , I beg you will permit me to be registered as a man who  means , tooth and nail , to support the Bramin opinions .


Registered .


PHILOSOPHER THE SEVENTH .


Down with me , Mr. President , as an Hobbist or Hobbesist , just , sir , as you choose to settle the orthography .
For I hold , with Mr. Hobbes that , the great law of the world is the law of convention .
I hold , that it is perfectly conformable to the law of nature that every man should have a right to take the life of a fellow-creature , because every man has a right to every thing .


Registered .


 Whew , said Sir Matthew - carrying Matilda and his nephew out of the assembly .


PHILOSOPHER THE EIGHTH .


Mr. President , I am a follower of Aristotle .


Registered .


PHILOSOPHER THE NINTH .


It would make me happy , Mr. President , to know , in the course of the learned debates which are to be agitated within these walls , what are really the philosophical and metaphysical import of the following words , which I have so very often read about , without being a whit the wiser - namely - infinity , incomprehensibility , eternity , plastick forms , monades , reason ,  instinct , substance , ignorance and wisdom ?


Registered .


PHILOSOPHER THE TENTH .


My principle , sir , is above all things , to take care of my parents  never to break my promise  to be abstemious  to doubt , when I am not certain of the propriety of an action  and to be as charitable as my fortune will permit .
Let me , therefore , be put down in the list as an admirer of Zoroaster .
What are called his superstitions , Mr. President , I am ready and able to defend .
I do not admit that any of his dogmas were erroneous , but I will take upon me to prove that he is superior to every man that went before or shall come after him .

 PHILOSOPHER THE ELEVENTH .


Epicurus for my money , Mr. President .
I will defend his charming doctrine to the last drop of my blood .

Mallebranche is my man , Mr. President , and I will enter the list with any gentleman of this society who will attempt to prove that pleasure is not able to make us happy .


Registered .


 PHILOSOPHER THE THIRTEENTH .


The person who spoke last , Mr. President , will find a powerful antagonist in me , for I profess the principles of Arnauld , and I do , with all the force that is in me , firmly deny that pleasure can make us happy .


Registered .


PHILOSOPHER THE FOURTEENTH .


I despise pleasure of all kinds , Mr. President  I have the greatest contempt for pain  grief has no sort of influence either upon my soul or body : I scorn life  I scorn death .
Insert me , therefore , as a man who will maintain the system of Epictetus , of Cato , and of every other illustrious STOICK like myself .


Registered .


 PHILOSOPHER THE FIFTEENTH .


About eight and twenty years ago , Mr. President , I took up a book which lay snug in a corner of my uncle Purepuzzle 's study , and I found it contain a religion , which I have ever since adopted .
The great founder hereof , Mr. President , enjoins , that we should be modest and humiliated , that to do no harm is not sufficient , we must do good  he bids us pardon injuries and never forget benefits .
To correct to day the faults of yesterday .
To stand , as it were , sentinel over our own hearts .
To cultivate every tenderness , and curb every passion  without pride or pageantry to bestow , and never to receive but in cases of  the last necessity , and then to accept a favour without stooping to meanness .
I stand up then , Mr. President , and I will for the future stand up while I have a leg to stand upon , a warm advocate of Confucius .

PHILOSOPHER THE SIXTEENTH .


I am one , Mr. President , who neither pin my faith upon the old tattered sleeve of Locke , Spinosa , Hobbes , Zoroaster , Epicurus , Mallebranche , Arnauld , Epictetus , or Confucius .


I do not care what these say the snap of my finger  because , superior to all leaders or leading-strings , Mr. President , I am a young fellow who thinks for myself .
But , alas !
I have  hitherto thought to so little purpose , that I am almost as much in the dark as if I had read the two and twenty thousand million philosophical books which , I understand , have been written to explain what is , perhaps , after all incomprehensible .
The subjects , Mr. President , which I want to have treated , are indeed such as foolish folks are in general afraid to enter upon  and therefore we have as yet no society which comes up to my idea of an academy of dispute : I hope this , Mr. President , ( which is opened upon your Green under your suffrage ) will be such .
It is with these expectations that I have come from the remotest part of Cornwall , to Shenstone-Green , where I will regularly  attend the debates of this honourable house till my soul is satisfied .
Not , however , Mr. President , to take up more of your time than I perceive is , on the present evening , allowed to one person , I shall briefly direct my hints to the ear of Mr. Deputy that he may insert them in his treasury of metaphysical materials .


FIRST ,


Let me be instructed how reason differs , either externally or internally , from instinct , and upon what principle it is that every beast of the field hath so strong a sense of obedience , gratitude , aversion and shame ?
I would wish to know if my dog hath not the faculty of combining and comparing ?
Does he think always or  does he never think ?
Does he - in fact , what is the precise difference betwixt him and your humble servant ?


Here a general laugh ensued , produced partly by the droll manner of the present speaker , and partly by the singularity of his harangue .


SECONDLY ,


I desire it may be debated whether human science is not a very absurd thing , and whether the wisdom of the wisest sage is not foolishness ?
I maintain , Mr. President , that it is neither convenient nor necessary for man to know much  and I suspect that we are every hour running our noses against matters that are wholly out of our line .
Pray , therefore , let  me be told whether knowledge is necessary , or whether `` ignorance is not bliss . ''


You have proposed questions enough , friend , said I , for at least a twelvemonth 's debate , and I therefore advise , that you reserve the rest for more leisure , as it begins to get late .


The philosopher assented , and his questions were

PHILOSOPHER THE SEVENTEENTH .


I should be glad to have it proved , Mr. President , at the very next meeting , whether it would not be more politick , more moral , and more to the honour of Shenstone-Green to turn the Academy of Dispute into an Academy  for keeping pigs , suckling calves , breeding chickens or for any other use equally innocent , rather than suffer it to stand upon its present foundation ?


Here a loud laugh burst from the multitude , and a growl muttered amongst the metaphysicians : but the speaker 's question appeared to me so apposite that I ordered it to be

PHILOSOPHER THE LAST .


Though I perceive , Mr. President , that the book of the deputy is about to be closed , I hope you will allow me , who am one of your regular pensioners , and who have seen all the disorders of Shenstone-Green , from the [ ... ]  upon his center ( while a kind of sarcastic smile pervaded a set of features naturally keen and rigid ) the philosophical pensioner began .

THE FOLLY AND WICKEDNESS OF PHILOSOPHERS .


 TO avoid giving offence , Mr. President , to any of the worthy and learned gentlemen , who have this evening enriched the Academy with stores of religious and metaphysical hints for future ratiocination , I shall not address them with any remarks of my own , but simply tell them a story which was told to me by a celebrated French philosopher  and which is , doubtless , as well known  to the learned Shenstonians as to me .
It was found amongst the posthumous papers of an ancient Rabbi .


The story runs thus :


When the most powerful , sagacious and wise Deity had , in six days , put the finishing stroke to his work - no less a performance than that of composing the world - when he had properly arranged the heavenly bodies , adjusted the musick of the spheres , and fitted every star to its orbit : when the secret springs which moved and regulated this sublime machine were curiously concealed from the acutest examiner , and when an impenetrable veil was thrown over the arcana of nature   it is said , that the great author of the whole , in the ineffability of his indulgence , amused himself with observing the progress of those ingenious little contrivers who call themselves PHILOSOPHERS .


To this end , says the story , he summoned all those who , on this speck of earth , had distinguished themselves as the founders or inventors of any particular faith : sophists , doctors , and all the proud sons of harangue and disputation were there .
Scot , Bonaventure , Gassendi , Thomas of Aquin , Descartes and every other illustrious name which hath either been trusted to the wing of posterity , or dropped into the vale of oblivion .


 They approached the star-incircled throne of the universal father , who , considering them as they really were , stooped from his unrivalled dignity , and conversed upon equal terms .


Lookee , my friends , let us see which of you hath the most intimate acquaintance with the governor of nature .
Tell me what I am , how I am made , and what is my secret ?
Tell me by what force or management the comets are sustained  and why in that globe upon which you once crawled , one ounce of good is , by a destiny too fatal , mixed up with fifty ounces of evil ?
When you have settled these points , you may , if you please , by way of supplement  tell me , who and what you yourselves are .
Speak freely .


It is a day of absolute liberty .
Speak to me with the same confidence you have spoken and written to your fellow-atoms .
I am aware that prizes have been proposed by way of encouraging you to these matters .
Be it so , I will , for once , adopt the rule of your academies , and give to him who shall offer the best and clearest idea , a great deal of money , and his salvation into the bargain .


He said , the philosophers applauded the proposal , and friend Thomas rose first - Thomas who always gets so well through the  thick and thin of an argument , and replies to every thing without having a doubt of any thing .


Thou art , said he , the existence and the essence , the pure substance , and the simple attribute : thou wert in time , out of time , before time and after time  the beginning , the middle , and the end  the great principle , and the great effect  thou art present every where without being any where .


The eternal , at these words , said , courage noble Thomas , courage , and covered the natural awe of his countenance by a smile .


After some little bustle , Descartes got up - Descartes , who was ever in  search of the whirlwind that he could not meet with - whose head was , as it were , be-powdered with subtle matter , and who went blundering on without even having read so much as the Evangelist .


Since I am permitted to speak , said Descartes , behold an argument , which I take to be uncontrovertible .
To be , it is enough that you are possible .
With respect to your universe it is a striking thing enough  but , whenever you think proper , I will make quite another-guess-affair of it .


I am able - yes , I Descartes , am able to form elements , animals , light and whirlwinds , out of a  little piece of matter .
Who knows the laws of motion so well as Descartes ?


The Deity smiled with pity for the second time .
Then rose the uncertain and hesitating Gassendi .
He tremblingly proposed to God his crooked atoms , although out of fashion , and decayed  but not venturing to say any thing of the supreme Essence , he stammered out a few more words about his crooked atoms and sat down .


Next stepped forth , with measured pace , a little , long-nosed Jew  poor , modest , happy , satisfied and retired .
His complexion was pale , his understanding subtle - he was more celebrated  than read , and he concealed himself under the mantle of his master Descartes .


Pardon me , said he - addressing himself to the throne , and speaking very low - pardon me - but I think , between ourselves , that you have no existence at all .
This , do I believe , is proved by my mathematicks .


Some feeble schoolmen , and bad criticks have opposed me  but you are able to judge how far I have been in the right .
You only are able to determine the limits of the genius of Spinosa .


The solid earth and azure heavens trembled at these words with horror  and affright .
Thomas of Aquin stepped back : all the philosophers looked alarmed  but the clement and good Deity , lamented the infidelity of Spinosa , ordered his poor brain to be cured , and gently commanded that he should be excluded from the senate of science .


Spinosa withdrew under the support of a few partizans .


Our philosophers , perceiving with what unbounded indulgence the Deity deigned to compassionate their extravagances , immediately held out in oftentatious pomp an hundred fair chimeras , and noble efforts of the human understanding .
They spoke , disputed , opposed , supported ,  cried and shouted all together .
The heavens and the earth were in an uproar .


Chaos was come again .
Thus , when to dine with some withered witch of a woman who erects her reputation upon feeding men of letters , fifteen or twenty beaux esprits , family authors , rhymsters , compilers , song-makers , and translators are gathered together , the house reechoes with the howlings of the hungry rabble , and the wandering passengers stand gaping in the street .


And now uprose with a conscious air , the redoubted Mallebranche .
Speak to the letter , speak to the word , and then I will answer , said  he .
In opposition to him , Arnauld started from his seat , and furiously said , that , the Sovereign Bounty created the human race propensely to damn it .
Leibnitz announced to the Turk and the Christian , that in his Harmony they would not be able to comprehend his meaning , that God , the world , and us little creeping creatures are nothing without Monades .
Every philosopher discovered his system , and sported his opinion .


The Deity by no means enraged - he is the best of fathers - permitted his children , without imposing laws too rigid , to amuse themselves like libertines as they were , with the work  of his hands .
But , as none of them had answered the questions quite to his satisfaction , he put off the prize to another year .


On the very same day , however ( continues the tale ) he dispatched his Angel Gabriel the ambassador of peace - the firm friend of pure hearts , and the messenger of good actions - with a particular commission down to earth .
Immediately the winged agent took a flight into twenty provinces , and paid a visit to saints , popes , princes , cardinals , and inquisitors , most of whom were , in past ages , devout persecutors .


Gentlemen , said he , the benign Father of all Mercies , orders you to  divert yourselves without oppressing any other person .
Be happy yourselves , but do not make others miserable .
He knows very well that there are a set of pretenders in in the world - a kind of literary empyricks , very wise and very profound - who are , like yourselves , egregrious blockheads .
But as they have neither the power nor the will to do any harm , the good God my master is too full of compassion to arm his omnipotence against the imbecillity of flesh and blood .


Because poor atoms , who have a glimmering faculty of thinking , think wrong , ought they to be roasted for that ?
Alas !
human philosophy is of such a nature that one should  not too rigidly mark what it doeth amiss .
Believe me , the book of a metaphysician is no very dangerous matter .
As it is born so dieth it in feebleness .
The arguments , which ye can make use of against the Most High , are as arrows shot from a loosened bow that is pulled by the arm of an infant .
They must needs drop short of their mark .
And when that mark is the glorious majesty of earth and heaven , judge how very wretched must be your most aspiring attempts !


To talk and to scribble is the privilege of the thing which hath most vanity , and the least reason to be vain .


 Imitate your tender father who doth nothing but smile and forgive .


Here ends my story , Mr. President , and it is now easy to determine whose system is the best .

PHILOSOPHY CONTRIBUTETH TO THE DESTRUCTION OF SHENSTONE-GREEN .


 THE whole assembly was up in arms at this story , at the relation of which I perfectly shuddered .


The philosophers deemed it absurd .


The wits applauded it as a fine morsel of fun .


The auditors , in general , declared it was impious and profane .
But the  murmurs of the partizans so violently increased , that I rose with indignation from my chair , and darting a look of contempt at the story-teller , went out of the Academy exclaiming , that I neither liked the institution nor the principles on which it was to move  and that they should never meet with my concurrence till they were likely to be conducted more to the honour of my Village , my COUNTRY and my GOD .


Notwithstanding these declarations , the disputants went on with all the vigour and violence of bigotted controversy  and the passion for declaiming grew to such a size that it seemed to lord it over every other .
It was  in vain that I combated this with all the little authority I had left myself  I argued upon the score of its involving us in religious dissentions , the fatal effects of which I pathetically pointed out .
In reply to this , they insisted that it was curtailing a generous liberty , and inflicting upon them a scandalous servitude , which implied a desire to tyrannize : and how , said they , can Sir Benjamin Beauchamp pretend to forbid those establishments taking place in a free village , which have always flourished in all large and polished cities .
TO THINK , they said , characterized men much less than to give language to thought .
Speech was , in their opinion , the cardinal distinction of humanity , and if Shenstone-Green  was not , above all other villages or towns upon earth , the properest for fair and full debate , they did not conceive rightly the idea of the liberty of Sir Benjamin 's subjects .


In proportion as I resisted , the philosophers preached up with vehemence the tolerating spirit , and when my consent was by no means to be gained to the contrivance of the Systematick Academy , the members publickly told me , that I had no power to repeal an act I had voluntarily made  and that as I had no right to tax the human understanding , they should proceed in the investigation of truth , though to get at her temple it might be necessary to shake the very  roof of the Academy with the solid powers of a metaphysical argument .


Thus , obliged to give up the point , the meetings became so frequent that the folly spread itself about till it fairly begirt my unfortunate village like a surrounding pestilence .
In a little time all sorts of religionists , sects , and system-mongers crept into a community sufficiently divided before .
Parties were formed and sustained with an animosity which denoted the most inveterate prejudice and hatred of each other : some combated for the Epicurean , some for the Platonick system  and it was no uncommon thing to see a number of my people gathered together to observe fair fighting ,  with tongue and fist , betwixt a Stoick and a Sceptick  a Materialist and a Roman Catholick , a Bramin and a Spinosian .
The infection presently ran to Tradesmen 's - Corner , and my mechanicks first hurried their work , and then fairly left it , to get to the Academy .
Many of them , who had weak heads and strong lungs , were exalted , by the force of such accomplishments , from hearers to speakers  and by such means , those who were formerly honest men , and industrious traders - who were , perhaps , raised from the hard fall of unavoidable bankruptcy , or set up newly in the shops I had provided - turned out blind enthusiasts , or absurd religionists , each of whom had just  knowledge as well as just religion enough to make them enemies , but not enough to make them friends .


In short , Shenstone-Green was now in an uproar both from civil and religious misfortunes .
It was miserably divided against itself , and you may be sure , reader , the total subversion of my little empire was not far off .


The New Paradise was fairly LOST .

AGREEABLE EVENTS , AND MUCH INNOCENCE .


 DURING these absurdities amongst the greater part of the inhabitants , the better few were labouring to compensate for the disorders of less worthy spirits .
Affairs stood thus : Sir Matthew Davies was exerting every tender manoeuvre to form his nephew to a regular system of moral and steady conduct .


Henceforth , my dear Danvers , said the baronet , consider , that the established  gentleman is too well acquainted with sinery to regard it .


As we now tread poetical ground , which is , perhaps , built on the most romantick passage in the works of William Shenstone , I will give you a maxim more reasonable from that author .


' Have an heart superior , with oeconomy suitable to your fortune . '
But I have said enough : my nephew , continued Sir Matthew , will be worthy the love of Matilda Beauchamp .


Mr. Sidney and Miss Elliot were engaged in little bickerings , which did not affect their mutual tenderness .


 Mr. Elixir was perfectly happy in trundling his wife over the Green in her gilt go-cart .


Henry Hewit , as he was the best , so was he the most blest of men in the arms of his now saithful Fanny .


Hackney Oldblade was blessing his good stars even for the loss of his limbs in the field of battle , since it was to the wounds there occasioned , he was indebted for his present felicity - Had not I been thus gloriously mangled , said the veteran , I should never have travelled upon my stumps to Shenstone-Green , nor ever have found my daughter .


The generous expences which the above parties had incurred on account  of young Davies , were all adjusted .


In the midst of these circumstances Mr. Sarcasm , the steward , sent me the following letter , which not a little disconcerted me .


To Sir BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP .


MY WORTHY MASTER .


IN very sorrow of foul I set me down at my desk to tell your Honour that we must needs part .
for the business of the Green does so blacken and thicken that it is too much for a man in years , who has , till lately , lived in a land properly secured by wife and salutary laws .


 Pray , your Honour , think a little of the life I am leading .
There are more petitions pass through these my feeble hands than if I were a Lord Chancellor , and every petitioner , who does not succed , honours me with abusive language .
But , waving this point , there are others which render mine office at this place insupportable , and with which it behoveth your Honour to be made acquainted .


Shenstone-Green is , by being built after a wrong model - your Honour will pardon me - become the most reprobate and disagreeable place I know .


We are over-run with lawyers , peace officers , and usurers , who have  scented their prey even in this once still corner of Wales .


We have no religion , no manners , and people are every hour buying an ounce of justice with a ton of gold .
Nor do I in troth think your Honour has any further occasion for a steward in this village , for pensioners are every day leaving their shells behind them , i. e. vacating your Honour 's houses , and those who remain imagine their patron to have so little authority , that it is only for the sake of preserving appearances that they teaze him with petitions .


These truths , sir , added to the great objection I have to babble and  noise , urge me to hope you will gently dismiss me from a post which can be no longer held with service to your honour , nor credit to


Your peace-loving Faithful humble servant , SAMUEL SARCASM .


Steward 's - Lodge .
On reading this letter to Sir Matthew Davies , he said , he must have some conversation with Sarcasm , and begged he might be sent for .


While these orders were giving , an express arrived at the Mansion-house for Sir Matthew , who received a small chest , and a large packet of Letters .
One of these , said he , examining  the hand , so particularly concerns me that I must retire to read it .


He withdrew to the next room , beckoning his nephew to follow him .


Matilda and I were alone .


Hang it , papa , said she , this Shenstone-Green is but a poor place after all .


A very poor place , indeed , Matilda .


Lord , Lord , how much better had I been feeding my linnets , nursing my sick canary , and driving the kite from my chickens , in Cumberland !


Heigho , Matilda !


 And yet , papa , it has its charms too .
I am sure I love this flower that I have got in my hand ten thousand times better than all the flowers that ever grew in Cumberland .


How long is it , my dear , since Sir Matthew 's nephew went into the garden and cut with your scissars -


Pshaw - now you think , papa , that I like the flower upon that account - Now , I protest -


But this village , my dear , I declare it is grown detestable to me .


Oh !
I hate it so , papa , I never desire to set my foot in it again .


I thought , Matilda , you said just now that it had more charms than -


 No  not Shenstone-Green , sir , I meant this house , and that garden , and the wood , and the little bench in the alcove , where there is scarce room enough for - for -


Sir Matthew 's nephew and you I suppose , Matilda - Hey !


Lord , papa , your head runs of nothing but Sir Matthew 's nephew .


But since we are alone Matilda , let me frankly confess to you , that I blush to think how deep I have plunged my fortune in a foolish scheme , and injured thereby my dear Matilda .
Through my absurdity , my dear , you will not have near so much money as you ought to have had .


 Then I shall have less occasion for it you know , papa , for Danvers will be a good oeconomist -


Danvers , did you say , Matilda ?
-


Yes , papa , and I do assure you , he yesterday declared to me upon his knees -


Upon his knees , Matilda ?


Yes , yes , I say , he declared upon both his knees , while he put up his dear white hands , thus , and laid his sweet cheek to my face -


His cheek to your face , Matilda ?


- Just for all the world as it might be thus -


 Lord , papa , how rough your skin is to his - well , and he swore that since his last visit to the Mansion-house , he valued one shilling more than ever he did a guinea before .
-


Do you indeed , said I , Danvers  I do by my soul , replied he , I do by this kiss .


By this kiss , Matilda , did you say ?


Kiss , papa , why if you had seen him kiss me that time , it was so different from every other -


Every other , Matilda ?


That you never could have forgot it - for the tears fell upon the poor  things face , and there was so much grief about his eyes , and his dear lips turned so pale , that I thought we should have both died upon the spot .


Then you love him , Matilda , more than ever .
To be sure I do , papa , and is not there good reason for it ?
Is not Danvers quite a tame , gentle creature , and do n't he love me with all his soul ?


But if after all , Matilda , he should gain your affections and then prove faithless .


Then , papa , will I be so good humoured and so faithful , that I will touch his fine heart and win him back again .


 You are resolved then to have him , Matilda , at all events .


I would make myself very miserable to please my father .


Come to your father 's arms - your father 's heart , Matilda , for you are dearer to me than -


Here , Sir Matthew and his nephew , who were in the next room rushed in .


Not dearer , Benjamin , cried Sir Matthew , to you than she is to me , and you are not much more her relation .


Do n't suppose you have a greater share of her than myself .


 Lookee , nephew , if you do not promise me to make it Matilda 's duty to call me uncle , by this day week , I will leave you and this house with a Whew .
-


Oh !
my God , said young Davies , what shall I do !
Why do my tears refuse to relieve me in this excess of my happiness !


Suppose , Matilda , said I , you and Mr. Davies were to go and court the stars this fine evening , as you sit on the little bench in the alcove where there is scarce room for two persons .


That , papa , said Matilda , slyly , would incommode the young gentleman , but as it is your desire , we  should take advantage of so heavenly a night , it would be rude not to -


Well said , hypocrite ( cried Sir Matthew , as Matilda was going out ) you will spoil my nephew , I doubt , at last .

A PROPOSAL FOR THE NEW-MODELLING OF SHENSTONE-GREEN .


 BY this time entered Mr. Samuel Sarcasm in obedience to the summons .


And so , Mr. Samuel , said Sir Matthew , you would wish to quit the Green ?


Your Honours both know my reasons , replied the steward .


To tell you the truth , my friend , said Sir Matthew , I am as tired of it  as yourself , and I think I may answer for Sir Benjamin into the bargain .
Say the truth , Sir Benjamin , is not your frolick over ?
Are you not convinced that Master Shenstone and you have only started a project , whose execution hath `` furnished inconveniencies proper only for a lively novel . ''


I am indeed , said I , groaning forth my profound conviction .


That being the case , answered Sir Matthew , suppose we make the best of a bad necessity , and turn as much as possible our misfortune to advantage .


Surely , said I .


 Putting up , therefore , with the loss of the several irrecoverable pensions , and the sums that have been jerked away upon other subjects equally useless , I have a plan to settle every thing else on a decent footing .


Heavens , said I , what plan is that ?


FIRST ,


Let your traders live here as in any other town , continuing to work and sell to the best advantage they can .
If they are rich enough to cock-fight , let them cock-fight  but , at all events , let them pay a trifling yearly rent to you for their houses , which , if they choose to quit ,  so much the better  then you may get better tenants  if they like to stay , so be it .
They will know the conditions : if they are insolent compel them into civility by law .


And must Shenstone-Green come to this ?
said I .


It must come to this or worse , replied Sir Matthew .


In troth , your Honour whistles my tune to a T , cried Samuel , smiling .


SECONDLY ,


Let you , I , and Samuel , continued Sir Matthew , buy , if it is to be done cheaply , all the publick buildings which stand upon your ground , Sir Benjamin , and let us convert them into the following uses : viz .


 The Concert-Room into a Charity-House for poor Welch orphans , to be educated and clothed at our expence till the age of twelve years .


The Pantheon , into a Free-School for boys .


The Theatre into an Alms-House for all old people past labour .


Humph !
cried Samuel , a little costively , this note does not suit my organs , your Honour , quite so well as the last .


THIRDLY ,


Let such pensioners houses as are vacated be let to any body who chooses to hire them , and Shenstone-Green is become too popular not to attract  inhabitants .
The profits of these may go towards the maintenance of the charities .
It would be well to cultivate commerce and invite all people to settle in this village , which may be easily done if the grand articles of life come cheap to them at first setting out .


Samuel shook his head .


FOURTHLY ,


Let matters , said Sir Matthew , go on just as they will , do you take care , Sir Benjamin , to be paid for every thing that is claimable  and I charge you to let the laws take their course for the future from one corner of Shenstone-Green to the other .


But how , Sir Matthew , said I , are all these things to be done .
I have  laid out already an immense sum of money , and must continue to pay off those cursed annuities .


Read that letter then , answered Sir Matthew .


To Sir MATTHEW DAVIES .


MY DEAR SIR MATTHEW ,


Your wandering whim has not injured your fortunes , for I considered your interest as mine , and have looked vigilantly after every thing that belonged to Sir Matthew Davies , while he was humourously vagabonding it as Mr. Seabrooke .
Your immense adventures which you hazarded abroad are returned safe , with such cargoes and freights as must swell your large fortune into almost an immensity .
The success of a certain  baronet , who traded to the Indian shores , is this very day blazing in the papers , so that your presence becomes necessary , as , indeed , nothing effectual can be done without you .
It is well your travelling name is no longer necessary , for it is so proper for you to come to town , and assume your real self , that had Shenstone-Green been really a paradise instead of a mere mortal village , built with mens hands , and polluted by mens vices , you could not consistently have delayed your departure .
Your captains will all want you in ten days , which must be the very longest date of your absence from London .


Your old friend , P. PECKHAM .


 I congratulated Sir Matthew on his acquisitions .


You see , replied he , that money can not be wanting , and I am determined us three will get this town again into our own hands , or else we will contrive to make those pay handsomely who stay in it .

THE PROPOSAL ACCEPTED .


 I HOLD that , reader , to be a villainous drawback upon thy pleasure , which delays , unnecessarily , the concluding events of an interesting book .
If this is not a book to interest I have disappointed myself : If it is , thou wilt doubtless think it the more so for conducting thee hastily through the stops and demurs with which authors are too apt to block up their catastrophe .
For my part , I shall lead thee , by the nearest way , to those things thou wantest most to know .


 Understand , therefore , that the plan of Sir Matthew , was , with the amendments of Mr. Samuel , put into execution without delay .


The traders were obliged to submit and Shenstone-Green shrunk down to a village , as villages go .


Not worse nor better  not any longer romantick , but real .


The charities were all instituted , and all that part of Wales , you will naturally believe , was the better for them .


Samuel Sarcasm remained still the steward but upon a very different principle .


He is to let the premises to the best advantage .


 Shouldest thou , reader , choose to become a tenant , it is only necessary for thee to take a journey into Glamorganshire , and make the best bargain thou art able with my old friend Samuel .


In that thou art an admirer and purchaser of this book , he will , I doubt not , be the more favourable to thee .


But should mere curiosity lead thee to see this celebrated town , thou hast only to find it out , and gratify thine heart .


Shouldest thou be so lucky as to hit upon the spot , fail not to say to thyself .
Alas , poor SHENSTONE-GEEEN !
Alas , poor HUMAN NATURE !

CONTAINING WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT .


 I HAVE settled all the business of the last chapter while Sir Matthew was dressing himself for a ceremony which there can be no one so ignorant as not to guess .


Thou seest , reader , the whole remaining matters before thee  and , it may be , thou expectest a very fine description of silks , sattins , and soft sayings .


 How wilt thou be mistaken !
for , my good friend , I shall only take thee by the hand into the largest room of the Mansion-house , and present thee to Mr. Davies and my Matilda , with Mr. Sidney and his Eliza , each of whom thou mayest , should it so please thee , wish much joy on their marriage .
In the middle of the room thou wilt pay thy compliments to Mrs. Elixir , who is sitting in her chair of state  and to her husband the apothecary , who is crying very heartily for happiness .
Possibly , thou wilt on the other side , like to make thy bow - and I desire thee to make it with reverence - to the gentle Fanny Hewit and her spouse  Sir Matthew Davies will meet thine eye dressed for once  like himself , and Samuel Sarcasm , who is tatling in the corner to Master Hackney Oldblade , will not pass thy attention if thou hast really any serious thoughts of visiting Shenstone-Green .

WHICH IS MORE THAN WAS BARGAINED FOR .


 THE moral to be adduced from this work , is , clearly , to prove the absolute chimera of forming any society which is to associate any number of people to enjoy one man 's benefaction under the eye of the benefactor .
It is impossible to introduce restricting regulations amongst men who expect that a favour should be as delicate as it is generous  so that no such societies can exist without being thrown into disorder .


 The benefactor may , indeed , make restrictions , but he is , upon the Shenstonian principle , in too nice a situation to enforce their practice  thus his lenity will produce evils which he can not punish  and his severity and indulgence are equally dangerous .


It therefore follows , that good order amongst men can be expected only under the check of governments , where wealth and preferment depend on the industry and care of every single individual  where the interest of one is deeply involved in that of another  where hope , fear , desire , and gratification , and all the chain of tumultuous and gentle passions are excited by due degrees  so that any excess in either is not with impunity to infringe the  rights of a neighbour  where few are overladen with obligation , but every man struggles for a little , so that obligations are pretty equally given and bestowed  and where , in fine , there is a regular code of laws , which pervades the empire , and provides equably reward and punishment to guard the privileges of one man from the violations of another .


THE END .
