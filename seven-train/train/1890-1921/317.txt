Dick Prattle , a Lieutenant-Major of the Royal Horse Marines .


Fame .


Scene


The Poet 's rooms in London .
Windows in back .
A high screen in a corner .


Time : February 30th .


The Poet is sitting at a table writing .


[ Enter Dick Prattle .


Prattle : Hullo , Harry .


de Reves : Hullo , Dick .
Good Lord , where are you from ?


Prattle ( casually ) : The ends of the earth .


de Reves : Well , I 'm damned !


Prattle : Thought I 'd drop in and see how you were getting on .


de Reves : Well , that 's splendid .
What are you doing in London ?


Prattle : Well , I wanted to see if I could get one or two decent ties to wear - you can get nothing out there - then I thought I 'd have a look and see how London was getting on .


de Reves : Splendid !
How 's everybody ?


Prattle : All going strong .


de Reves : That 's good .


Prattle ( seeing paper and ink ) : But what are you doing ?


de Reves : Writing .


Prattle : Writing ?
I did n't know you wrote .


de Reves : Yes , I 've taken to it rather .


Prattle : I say - writing 's no good .
What do you write ?


de Reves : Oh , poetry .


Prattle : Poetry !
Good Lord !


de Reves : Yes , that sort of thing , you know .


Prattle : Good Lord !
Do you make any money by it ?


de Reves : No .
Hardly any .


Prattle : I say - why do n't you chuck it ?


de Reves : Oh , I do n't know .
Some people seem to like my stuff , rather .
That 's why I go on .


Prattle : I 'd chuck it if there 's no money in it .


de Reves : Ah , but then it 's hardly in your line , is it ?
You 'd hardly approve of poetry if there was money in it .


Prattle : Oh , I do n't say that .
If I could make as much by poetry as I can by betting I do n't say I would n't try the poetry touch , only - -


de Reves : Only what ?


Prattle : Oh , I do n't know .
Only there seems more sense in betting , somehow .


de Reves : Well , yes .
I suppose it 's easier to tell what an earthly horse is going to do , than to tell what Pegasus - -


Prattle : What 's Pegasus ?


de Reves : Oh , the winged horse of poets .


Prattle : I say !
You do n't believe in a winged horse , do you ?


de Reves : In our trade we believe in all fabulous things .
They all represent some large truth to us .
An emblem like Pegasus is as real a thing to a poet as a Derby winner would be to you .


Prattle : I say .
( Give me a cigarette .
Thanks . )
What ?
Then you 'd believe in nymphs and fauns , and Pan , and all those kind of birds ?


de Reves : Yes .
Yes .
In all of them .


Prattle : Good Lord !


de Reves : You believe in the Lord Mayor of London , do n't you ?


Prattle : Yes , of course  but what has - -


de Reves : Four million people or so made him Lord Mayor , did n't they ?
And he represents to them the wealth and dignity and tradition of - -


Prattle : Yes  but , I say , what has all this - -


de Reves : Well , he stands for an idea to them , and they made him Lord Mayor , and so he is one ...


Prattle : Well , of course he is .


de Reves : In the same way Pan has been made what he is by millions  by millions to whom he represents world-old traditions .


Prattle ( rising from his chair and stepping backwards , laughing and looking at the Poet in a kind of assumed wonder ) : I say ... I say ... You old heathen ... but Good Lord ...


[ He bumps into the high screen behind , pushing it back a little .


de Reves : Look out !
Look out !


Prattle : What ?
What 's the matter ?


de Reves : The screen !


Prattle : Oh , sorry , yes .
I 'll put it right .


[ He is about to go round behind it .


de Reves : No , do n't go round there .


Prattle : What ?
Why not ?


de Reves : Oh , you would n't understand .


Prattle : Would n't understand ?
Why , what have you got ?


de Reves : Oh , one of those things ... You would n't understand .


Prattle : Of course I 'd understand .
Let 's have a look .


[ The Poet walks towards Prattle and the screen .
He protests no further .
Prattle looks round the corner of the screen .


An altar .


de Reves ( removing the screen altogether ) : That is all .
What do you make of it ?


[ An altar of Greek design , shaped like a pedestal , is revealed .
Papers litter the floor all about it .


Prattle : I say - you always were an untidy devil .


de Reves : Well , what do you make of it ?


Prattle : It reminds me of your room at Eton .


de Reves : My room at Eton ?


Prattle : Yes , you always had papers all over your floor .


de Reves : Oh , yes - -


Prattle : And what are these ?


de Reves : All these are poems  and this is my altar to Fame .


Prattle : To Fame ?


de Reves : The same that Homer knew .


Prattle : Good Lord !


de Reves : Keats never saw her .
Shelley died too young .
She came late at the best of times , now scarcely ever .


Prattle : But , my dear fellow , you do n't mean that you think there really is such a person ?


de Reves : I offer all my songs to her .


Prattle : But you do n't mean you think you could actually see Fame ?


de Reves : We poets personify abstract things , and not poets only but sculptors7 and painters too .
All the great things of the world are those abstract things .


Prattle : But what I mean is , they 're not really there , like you or me .


de Reves : To us these things are more real than men , they outlive generations , they watch the passing of kingdoms : we go by them like dust  they are still there , unmoved , unsmiling .


Prattle : But , but , you ca n't think that you could see Fame , you do n't expect to see it ?


de Reves : Not to me .
Never to me .
She of the golden trumpet and Greek dress will never appear to me ... We all have our dreams .


Prattle : I say - what have you been doing all day ?


de Reves : I ?
Oh , only writing a sonnet .


Prattle : Is it a long one ?


de Reves : Not very .


Prattle : About how long is it ?


de Reves : About fourteen lines .


Prattle ( impressively ) : I tell you what it is .


de Reves : Yes ?


Prattle : I tell you what .
You 've been overworking yourself .
I once got like that on board the Sandhurst , working for the passing-out exam .
I got so bad that I could have seen anything .


de Reves : Seen anything ?


Prattle : Lord , yes  horned pigs , snakes with wings  anything  one of your winged horses even .
They gave me some stuff called bromide for it .
You take a rest .


de Reves : But my dear fellow , you do n't understand at all .
I merely said that abstract things are to a poet as near and real and visible as one of your bookmakers or barmaids .


Prattle : I know .
You take a rest .


de Reves : Well , perhaps I will .
I 'd come with you to that musical comedy you 're going to see , only I 'm a bit tired after writing this  it 's a tedious job .
I 'll come another night .


Prattle : How do you know I 'm going to see a musical comedy ?


de Reves : Well , where would you go ?
Hamlet 's 8 on at the Lord Chamberlain 's .
You 're not going there .


Prattle : Do I look like it ?


de Reves : No .


Prattle : Well , you 're quite right .
I 'm going to see `` The Girl from Bedlam . ''
So long .
I must push off now .
It 's getting late .
You take a rest .
Do n't add another line to that sonnet  fourteen 's quite enough .
You take a rest .
Do n't have any dinner to-night , just rest .
I was like that once myself .
So long .


de Reves : So long .


[ Exit Prattle .
de Reves returns to his table and sits down .


Good old Dick !
He 's the same as ever .
Lord , how time passes .


He takes his pen and his sonnet and makes a few alterations .


Well , that 's finished .
I ca n't do any more to it .


[ He rises and goes to the screen  he draws back part of it and goes up to the altar .
He is about to place his sonnet reverently at the foot of the altar amongst his other verses .


No , I will not put it there .
This one is worthy of the altar .


[ He places the sonnet upon the altar itself .


If that sonnet does not give me fame , nothing that I have done before will give it to me , nothing that I ever will do .


[ He replaces the screen and returns to his chair at the table .
Twilight is coming on .
He sits with his elbow on the table , his head on his hand , or however the actor pleases .


Well , well .
Fancy seeing Dick again .
Well , Dick enjoys his life , so he 's no fool .
What was that he said ?
`` There 's no money in poetry .
You 'd better chuck it . ''
Ten years ' work and what have I to show for it ?
The admiration of men who care for poetry , and how many of them are there ?
There 's a bigger demand for smoked glasses to look at eclipses of the sun .
Why should Fame come to me ?
Have n't I given up my days for her ?
That is enough to keep her away .
I am a poet  that is enough reason for her to slight me .
Proud and aloof and cold as marble , what does Fame care for us ?
Yes , Dick is right .
It 's a poor game chasing illusions , hunting the intangible , pursuing dreams .
Dreams ?
Why , we are ourselves dreams .


[ He leans back in his chair .


We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .
[ He is silent for a while .
Suddenly he lifts his head .


My room at Eton , Dick said .
An untidy mess .


[ As he lifts his head and says these words , twilight gives place to broad daylight , merely as a hint that the author of the play may have been mistaken , and the whole thing may have been no more than a poet 's dream .


So it was , and it 's an untidy mess there ( looking at screen ) too .
Dick 's right .
I 'll tidy it up .
I 'll burn the whole damned heap ,


[ He advances impetuously towards the screen .


every damned poem that I was ever fool enough to waste my time on .


[ He pushes back the screen .
Fame in a Greek dress with a long golden trumpet in her hand is seen standing motionless on the altar like a marble goddess .


So ... you have come !


[ For a while he stands thunderstruck .
Then he approaches the altar .


Divine fair lady , you have come .


[ He holds up his hand to her and leads her down from the altar and into the centre of the stage .
At whatever moment the actor finds it most convenient , he repossesses himself of the sonnet that he had placed on the altar .
He now offers it to Fame .


This is my sonnet .
Is it well done ?


[ Fame takes it and reads it in silence , while the Poet watches her rapturously .


Fame : You 're a bit of all right .


de Reves : What ?


Fame : Some poet .


de Reves : I - I - scarcely ... understand .


Fame : You 're IT .


de Reves : But ... it is not possible ... are you she that knew Homer ?


Fame : Homer ?
Lord , yes .
Blind old bat , ' e could n't see a yard .


de Reves : O Heavens !


[ Fame walks beautifully to the window .
She opens it and puts her head out .


Fame ( in a voice with which a woman in an upper storey would cry for help if the house was well alight ) : Hi !
Hi !
Boys !
Hi !
Say , folks !
Hi !


[ The murmur of a gathering crowd is heard .
Fame blows her trumpet .


Fame : Hi , he 's a poet !
( Quickly , over her shoulder . )
What 's your name ?


de Reves : De Reves .


Fame : His name 's de Reves .


de Reves : Harry de Reves .


Fame : His pals call him Harry .


The Crowd : Hooray !
Hooray !
Hooray !


Fame : Say , what 's your favourite colour ?


de Reves : I ... I ... I do n't quite understand .


Fame : Well , which do you like best , green or blue ?


de Reves : Oh - er - blue .


[ She blows her trumpet out of the window .


No - er - I think green .


Fame : Green is his favourite colour .


The Crowd : Hooray !
Hooray !
Hooray !


Fame : ` Ere , tell us something .
They want to know all about yer .


de Reves : Would n't 9 you perhaps ... would they care to hear my sonnet , if you would - er ...


Fame ( picking up quill ) : Here , what 's this ?


de Reves : Oh , that 's my pen .


Fame ( after another blast on her trumpet ) : He writes with a quill .


[ Cheers from the Crowd .


Fame ( going to a cupboard ) : Here , what have you got in here ?


de Reves : Oh ... er ... those are my breakfast things .


Fame ( finding a dirty plate ) : What have yer had on this one ?


de Reves ( mournfully ) : Oh , eggs and bacon .


Fame ( at the window ) : He has eggs and bacon for breakfast .


The Crowd : Hip hip hip , hooray !
Hip hip hip , hooray !
Hip hip hip , hooray !
Fame : Hi , and what 's this ?


de Reves ( miserably ) : Oh , a golf stick .


Fame : He 's a man 's man !
He 's a virile man !
He 's a manly man !


[ Wild cheers from the Crowd , this time only from women 's voices .


de Reves : Oh , this is terrible .
This is terrible .
This is terrible .


[ Fame gives another peal on her horn .
She is about to speak .


de Reves ( solemnly and mournfully ) : One moment , one moment ...


Fame : Well , out with it .


de Reves : For ten years , divine lady , I have worshipped you , offering all my songs ... I find ... I find I am not worthy ...


Fame : Oh , you 're all right .


de Reves : No , no , I am not worthy .
It can not be .
It can not possibly be .
Others deserve you more .
I must say it !
I can not possibly love you .
Others are worthy .
You will find others .
But I , no , no , no .
It can not be .
It can not be .
Oh , pardon me , but it must not .


[ Meanwhile Fame has been lighting one of his cigarettes .
She sits in a comfortable chair , leans right back , and puts her feet right up on the table amongst the poet 's papers .


Oh , I fear I offend you .
But - it can not be .


Fame : Oh , that 's all right , old bird  no offence .
I ai n't going to leave you .


de Reves : But - but - but - I do not understand .


Fame : I 've come to stay , I have .


[ She blows a puff of smoke through her trumpet .


CURTAIN .
