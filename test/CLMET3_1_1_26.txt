PROLOGUE .
</p>
<p>
Ye glitt ` ring train , whom lace and velvet bless , Suspend the soft solicitudes of dress !
From grov ` ling bus ` ness and superfluous care , Ye sons of avarice , a moment spare !
Vot ` ries of fame , and worshippers of power , Dismiss the pleasing phantoms for an hour !
Our daring bard , with spirit unconfin'd , Spreads wide the mighty moral for mankind .
Learn here , how heaven supports the virtuous mind , Daring , though calm ; and vig ` rous , though resign'd ; Learn here , what anguish racks the guilty breast , In pow ' r dependant , in success depress'd .
Learn here , that peace from innocence must flow ; All else is empty sound , and idle show .
</p>
<p>
If truths , like these , with pleasing language join ; Ennobled , yet unchang'd , if nature shine ; If no wild draught depart from reason 's rules ; Nor gods his heroes , nor his lovers fools ; Intriguing wits !
his artless plot forgive ; And spare him , beauties !
though his lovers live .
</p>
<p>
Be this , at least , his praise , be this his pride ; To force applause , no modern arts are try'd .
Should partial catcals all his hopes confound , He bids no trumpet quell the fatal sound .
Should welcome sleep relieve the weary wit , He rolls no thunders o'er the drowsy pit ; No snares , to captivate the judgment , spreads , Nor bribes your eyes to prejudice your heads .
Unmov'd , though witlings sneer , and rivals rail , Studious to please , yet not asham'd to fail , He scorns the meek address , the suppliant strain , With merit needless , and without it vain .
In reason , nature , truth , he dares to trust : Ye fops , be silent : and , ye wits , be just !

ACT I. -- SCENE I .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS and LEONTIUS , in Turkish habits .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
And , is it thus Demetrius meets his friend , Hid in the mean disguise of Turkish robes , With servile secrecy to lurk in shades , And vent our suff ` rings in clandestine groans ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Till breathless fury rested from destruction , These groans were fatal , these disguises vain : But , now our Turkish conquerors have quench'd Their rage , and pall'd their appetite of murder , No more the glutted sabre thirsts for blood ; And weary cruelty remits her tortures .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Yet Greece enjoys no gleam of transient hope , No soothing interval of peaceful sorrow : The lust of gold succeeds the rage of conquest ; -- The lust of gold , unfeeling and remorseless , The last corruption of degen ` rate man !
Urg'd by th ' imperious soldiers ' fierce command , The groaning Greeks break up their golden caverns , Pregnant with stores , that India 's mines might envy , Th ' accumulated wealth of toiling ages .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
That wealth , too sacred for their country 's use !
That wealth , too pleasing to be lost for freedom !
That wealth , which , granted to their weeping prince , Had rang'd embattled nations at our gates !
But , thus reserv'd to lure the wolves of Turkey , Adds shame to grief , and infamy to ruin .
Lamenting av ` rice , now too late , discovers Her own neglected in the publick safety .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Reproach not misery .
-- The sons of Greece , Ill fated race !
so oft besieg'd in vain , With false security beheld invasion .
Why should they fear ?
-- That pow ' r that kindly spreads The clouds , a signal of impending show ` rs , To warn the wand ` ring linnet to the shade , Beheld without concern expiring Greece ; And not one prodigy foretold our fate .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
A thousand horrid prodigies foretold it : A feeble government , eluded laws , A factious populace , luxurious nobles , And all the maladies of sinking states .
When publick villany , too strong for justice , Shows his bold front , the harbinger of ruin , Can brave Leontius call for airy wonders , Which cheats interpret , and which fools regard ?
When some neglected fabrick nods beneath The weight of years , and totters to the tempest , Must heav'n despatch the messengers of light , Or wake the dead , to warn us of its fall ?
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Well might the weakness of our empire sink Before such foes of more than human force : Some pow ' r invisible , from heav'n or hell , Conducts their armies , and asserts their cause .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
And yet , my friend , what miracles were wrought Beyond the pow ' r of constancy and courage ?
Did unresisted lightning aid their cannon ?
Did roaring whirlwinds sweep us from the ramparts ?
'T was vice that shook our nerves , 't was vice , Leontius , That froze our veins , and wither'd all our pow ` rs .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Whate'er our crimes , our woes demand compassion .
Each night , protected by the friendly darkness , Quitting my close retreat , I range the city , And , weeping , kiss the venerable ruins ; With silent pangs , I view the tow ` ring domes , Sacred to pray ` r ; and wander through the streets , Where commerce lavish'd unexhausted plenty , And jollity maintain'd eternal revels --
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
-- How chang'd , alas !
-- Now ghastly desolation , In triumph , sits upon our shatter'd spires ; Now superstition , ignorance , and errour , Usurp our temples , and profane our altars .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
From ev'ry palace bursts a mingled clamour , The dreadful dissonance of barb ` rous triumph , Shrieks of affright , and waitings of distress .
Oft when the cries of violated beauty Arose to heav ` n , and pierc'd my bleeding breast , I felt thy pains , and trembled for Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Aspasia !
-- spare that lov'd , that mournful name : Dear , hapless maid -- tempestuous grief o'erbears My reasoning pow ` rs -- Dear , hapless , lost Aspasia !
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Suspend the thought .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
All thought on her is madness ; Yet let me think -- I see the helpless maid ; Behold the monsters gaze with savage rapture , Behold how lust and rapine struggle round her !
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Awake , Demetrius , from this dismal dream ; Sink not beneath imaginary sorrows ; Call to your aid your courage and your wisdom ; Think on the sudden change of human scenes ; Think on the various accidents of war ; Think on the mighty pow ' r of awful virtue ; Think on that providence that guards the good .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
O providence !
extend thy care to me ; For courage droops , unequal to the combat ; And weak philosophy denies her succours .
Sure , some kind sabre in the heat of battle , Ere yet the foe found leisure to be cruel , Dismiss'd her to the sky .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Some virgin martyr , Perhaps , enamour'd of resembling virtue , With gentle hand , restrain'd the streams of life , And snatch'd her timely from her country 's fate .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
From those bright regions of eternal day , Where now thou shin ` st among thy fellow-saints , Array'd in purer light , look down on me : In pleasing visions and assuasive dreams , O !
sooth my soul , and teach me how to lose thee .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Enough of unavailing tears , Demetrius : I come obedient to thy friendly summons , And hop'd to share thy counsels , not thy sorrows : While thus we mourn the fortune of Aspasia , To what are we reserv'd ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
To what I know not : But hope , yet hope , to happiness and honour ; If happiness can be , without Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
But whence this new-sprung hope ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
From Cali bassa , The chief , whose wisdom guides the Turkish counsels .
He , tir'd of slav ` ry , though the highest slave , Projects , at once , our freedom and his own ; And bids us , thus disguis'd , await him here .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Can he restore the state he could not save ?
In vain , when Turkey 's troops assail'd our walls , His kind intelligence betray'd their measures ; Their arms prevail'd , though Cali was our friend .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
When the tenth sun had set upon our sorrows , At midnight 's private hour , a voice unknown Sounds in my sleeping ear , ` Awake , Demetrius , Awake , and follow me to better fortunes . '
Surpris'd I start , and bless the happy dream ; Then , rousing , know the fiery chief Abdalla , Whose quick impatience seiz'd my doubtful hand , And led me to the shore where Cali stood , Pensive , and list'ningto the beating surge .
There , in soft hints , and in ambiguous phrase , With all the diffidence of long experience , That oft had practis'd fraud , and oft detected , The vet ` ran courtier half reveal'd his project .
By his command , equipp'd for speedy flight , Deep in a winding creek a galley lies , Mann'd with the bravest of our fellow-captives , Selected by my care , a hardy band , That long to hail thee chief .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
But what avails So small a force ?
or , why should Cali fly ?
Or , how can Call 's flight restore our country ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Reserve these questions for a safer hour ; Or hear himself , for see the bassa comes .
</p>
<p>
SCENE II .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS , LEONTIUS , CALI .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Now summon all thy soul , illustrious Christian !
Awake each faculty that sleeps within thee : The courtier 's policy , the sage 's firmness , The warriour 's ardour , and the patriot 's zeal .
If , chasing past events with vain pursuit , Or wand ` ring in the wilds of future being , A single thought now rove , recall it home .
-- But can thy friend sustain the glorious cause , The cause of liberty , the cause of nations ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Observe him closely , with a statesman 's eye , Thou , that hast long perus'd the draughts of nature , And know ` st the characters of vice and virtue , Left by the hand of heav'n on human clay .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
His mien is lofty , his demeanour great ; Nor sprightly folly wantons in his air ; Nor dull serenity becalms his eyes .
Such had I trusted once , as soon as seen , But cautious age suspects the flatt ` ring form , And only credits what experience tells .
Has silence press'd her seal upon his lips ?
Does adamantine faith invest his heart ?
Will he not bend beneath a tyrant 's frown ?
Will he not melt before ambition 's fire ?
Will he not soften in a friend 's embrace ?
Or flow dissolving in a woman 's tears ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Sooner the trembling leaves shall find a voice , And tell the secrets of their conscious walks ; Sooner the breeze shall catch the flying sounds , And shock the tyrant with a tale of treason .
Your slaughter'd multitudes , that swell the shore With monuments of death , proclaim his courage ; Virtue and liberty engross his soul , And leave no place for perfidy , or fear .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
I scorn a trust unwillingly repos'd ; Demetrius will not lead me to dishonour ; Consult in private , call me , when your scheme Is ripe for action , and demands the sword .
[ Going .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Leontius , stay .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Forgive an old man 's weakness , And share the deepest secrets of my soul , My wrongs , my fears , my motives , my designs .
-- When unsuccessful wars , and civil factions Embroil'd the Turkish state , our sultan 's father , Great Amurath , at my request , forsook The cloister 's ease , resum'd the tott ` ring throne , And snatch'd the reins of abdicated pow ' r From giddy Mahomet 's unskilful hand .
This fir'd the youthful king 's ambitious breast : He murmurs vengeance , at the name of Cali , And dooms my rash fidelity to ruin .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Unhappy lot of all that shine in courts , For forc'd compliance , or for zealous virtue , Still odious to the monarch , or the people .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Such are the woes , when arbitrary pow ' r And lawless passion hold the sword of justice .
If there be any land , as fame reports , Where common laws restrain the prince and subject , A happy land , where circulating pow ' r Flows through each member of th ' embodied state ; Sure , not unconscious of the mighty blessing , Her grateful sons shine bright with every virtue ; Untainted with the lust of innovation , Sure , all unite to hold her league of rule Unbroken , as the sacred chain of nature That links the jarring elements in peace .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
But say , great bassa , why the sultan 's anger , Burning in vain , delays the stroke of death ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Young , and unsettled in his father 's kingdoms , Fierce as he was , he dreaded to destroy The empire 's darling , and the soldier 's boast ; But now confirm'd , and swelling with his conquests , Secure , he tramples my declining fame , Frowns unrestrain'd , and dooms me with his eyes .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
What can reverse thy doom ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
The tyrant 's death .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
But Greece is still forgot .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
On Asia 's coast , Which lately bless'd my gentle government , Soon as the sultan 's unexpected fate Fills all th ' astonish'd empire with confusion , My policy shall raise an easy throne ; The Turkish pow ` rs from Europe shall retreat , And harass Greece no more with wasteful war .
A galley mann'd with Greeks , thy charge , Leontius , Attends to waft us to repose and safety .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
That vessel , if observ'd , alarms the court , And gives a thousand fatal questions birth : Why stor'd for flight ?
and why prepar'd by Cali ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
This hour I 'll beg , with unsuspecting face , Leave to perform my pilgrimage to Mecca ; Which granted , hides my purpose from the world , And , though refus'd , conceals it from the sultan .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
How can a single hand attempt a life , Which armies guard , and citadels enclose ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Forgetful of command , with captive beauties , Far from his troops , he toys his hours away .
A roving soldier seiz'd , in Sophia 's temple , A virgin , shining with distinguish'd charms , And brought his beauteous plunder to the sultan --
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
In Sophia 's temple !
-- What alarm !
-- Proceed .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
The sultan gaz'd , he wonder'd , and he lov'd : In passion lost , he bade the conqu ` ring fair Renounce her faith , and be the queen of Turkey .
The pious maid , with modest indignation , Threw back the glitt ` ring bribe .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Celestial goodness !
It must , it must be she ; -- her name ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
What hopes , what terrours , rush upon my soul !
O lead me quickly to the scene of fate ; Break through the politician 's tedious forms ; Aspasia calls me , let me fly to save her .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Did Mahomet reproach , or praise her virtue ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
His offers , oft repeated , still refus'd , At length rekindled his accustomed fury , And chang'd th ' endearing smile , and am ` rous whisper To threats of torture , death , and violation .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
These tedious narratives of frozen age Distract my soul ; -- despatch thy ling ` ring tale ; Say , did a voice from heav'n restrain the tyrant ?
Did interposing angels guard her from him ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Just in the moment of impending fate , Another plund ` rer brought the bright Irene ; Of equal beauty , but of softer mien , Fear in her eye , submission on her tongue , Her mournful charms attracted his regards , Disarm'd his rage , and , in repeated visits , Gain'd all his heart ; at length , his eager love To her transferr'd the offer of a crown ,
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Nor found again the bright temptation fail ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Trembling to grant , nor daring to refuse , While heav'n and Mahomet divide her fears , With coy caresses and with pleasing wiles She feeds his hopes , and sooths him to delay .
For her , repose is banish'd from the night , And bus ` ness from the day : in her apartments He lives --
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
And there must fall .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
But yet , th ' attempt Is hazardous .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Forbear to speak of hazards ; What has the wretch , that has surviv'd his country , His friends , his liberty , to hazard ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Life .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Th ' inestimable privilege of breathing !
Important hazard !
What 's that airy bubble , When weigh'd with Greece , with virtue , with Aspasia ?
-- A floating atom , dust that falls , unheeded , Into the adverse scale , nor shakes the balance .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
At least , this day be calm -- If we succeed , Aspasia 's thine , and all thy life is rapture .
-- See !
Mustapha , the tyrant 's minion , comes ; Invest Leontius with his new command ; And wait Abdalla 's unsuspected visits : Remember freedom , glory , Greece , and love .
[ Exeunt Demetrius and Leontius .
</p>
<p>
SCENE III .
</p>
<p>
CALI , MUSTAPHA .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
By what enchantment does this lovely Greek Hold in her chains the captivated sultan ?
He tires his fav ` rites with Irene 's praise , And seeks the shades to muse upon Irene ; Irene steals , unheeded , from his tongue , And mingles , unperceiv'd , with ev'ry thought .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Why should the sultan shun the joys of beauty , Or arm his breast against the force of love ?
Love , that with sweet vicissitude relieves The warriour 's labours and the monarch 's cares .
But , will she yet receive the faith of Mecca ?
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Those pow ` rful tyrants of the female breast , Fear and ambition , urge her to compliance ; Dress'd in each charm of gay magnificence , Alluring grandeur courts her to his arms , Religion calls her from the wish'd embrace , Paints future joys , and points to distant glories .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Soon will th ' unequal contest be decided .
Prospects , obscur'd by distance , faintly strike ; Each pleasure brightens , at its near approach , And ev'ry danger shocks with double horrour .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
How shall I scorn the beautiful apostate !
How will the bright Aspasia shine above her !
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Should she , for proselytes are always zealous , With pious warmth receive our prophet 's law --
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Heav'n will contemn the mercenary fervour , Which love of greatness , not of truth , inflames .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Cease , cease thy censures ; for the sultan comes Alone , with am ` rous haste to seek his love .
</p>
<p>
SCENE IV .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET , CALI , MUSTAPHA .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Hail !
terrour of the monarchs of the world ; Unshaken be thy throne , as earth 's firm base ; Live , till the sun forgets to dart his beams , And weary planets loiter in their courses !
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
But , Cali , let Irene share thy prayers ; For what is length of days , without Irene ?
I come from empty noise , and tasteless pomp , From crowds , that hide a monarch from himself , To prove the sweets of privacy and friendship , And dwell upon the beauties of Irene .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
O may her beauties last , unchang'd by time , As those that bless the mansions of the good !
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Each realm , where beauty turns the graceful shape , Swells the fair breast , or animates the glance , Adorns my palace with its brightest virgins ; Yet , unacquainted with these soft emotions , I walk'd superiour through the blaze of charms , Prais'd without rapture , left without regret .
Why rove I now , when absent from my fair , From solitude to crowds , from crowds to solitude , Still restless , till I clasp the lovely maid , And ease my loaded soul upon her bosom ?
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Forgive , great sultan , that intrusive duty Inquires the final doom of Menodorus , The Grecian counsellor .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Go , see him die ; His martial rhet ` rick taught the Greeks resistance ; Had they prevail'd , I ne'er had known Irene .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Mustapha .
</p>
<p>
SCENE V .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET , CALI .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Remote from tumult , in th ' adjoining palace , Thy care shall guard this treasure of my soul : There let Aspasia , since my fair entreats it , With converse chase the melancholy moments .
Sure , chill'd with sixty winter camps , thy blood , At sight of female charms , will glow no more .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
These years , unconquer'd Mahomet , demand Desires more pure , and other cares than love .
Long have I wish'd , before our prophet 's tomb , To pour my pray ` rs for thy successful reign , To quit the tumults of the noisy camp , And sink into the silent grave in peace .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
What !
think of peace , while haughty Scanderbeg , Elate with conquest , in his native mountains , Prowls o'er the wealthy spoils of bleeding Turkey !
While fair Hungaria 's unexhausted valleys Pour forth their legions ; and the roaring Danube Rolls half his floods , unheard , through shouting camps !
Nor could ` st thou more support a life of sloth Than Amurath --
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Still , full of Amurath !
[ Aside .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Than Amurath , accustom'd to command , Could bear his son upon the Turkish throne .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
This pilgrimage our lawgiver ordain'd --
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
For those , who could not please by nobler service .
-- Our warlike prophet loves an active faith .
The holy flame of enterprising virtue Mocks the dull vows of solitude and penance , And scorns the lazy hermit 's cheap devotion .
Shine thou , distinguish'd by superiour merit ; With wonted zeal pursue the task of war , Till ev'ry nation reverence the koran , And ev'ry suppliant lift his eyes to Mecca .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
This regal confidence , this pious ardour , Let prudence moderate , though not suppress .
Is not each realm , that smiles with kinder suns , Or boasts a happier soil , already thine ?
Extended empire , like expanded gold , Exchanges solid strength for feeble splendour .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Preach thy dull politicks to vulgar kings , Thou know ` st not yet thy master 's future greatness , His vast designs , his plans of boundless pow ` r .
When ev'ry storm in my domain shall roar , When ev'ry wave shall beat a Turkish shore ; Then , Cali , shall the toils of battle cease , Then dream of pray ` r , and pilgrimage , and peace .
[ Exeunt .
</p>
<p>
ACT II .
-- SCENE I. ASPASIA , IRENE .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Aspasia , yet pursue the sacred theme ; Exhaust the stores of pious eloquence , And teach me to repel the sultan 's passion .
Still , at Aspasia 's voice , a sudden rapture Exalts my soul , and fortifies my heart ; The glitt ` ring vanities of empty greatness , The hopes and fears , the joys and pains of life , Dissolve in air , and vanish into nothing .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Let nobler hopes and juster fears succeed , And bar the passes of Irene 's mind Against returning guilt .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
When thou art absent , Death rises to my view , with all his terrours ; Then visions , horrid as a murd ` rer 's dreams , Chill my resolves , and blast my blooming virtue : Stern torture shakes his bloody scourge before me , And anguish gnashes on the fatal wheel .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Since fear predominates in ev'ry thought , And sways thy breast with absolute dominion , Think on th ' insulting scorn , the conscious pangs , The future mis ` ries , that wait th ' apostate ; So shall timidity assist thy reason , And wisdom into virtue turn thy frailty .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Will not that pow ` r , that form'd the heart of woman , And wove the feeble texture of her nerves , Forgive those fears that shake the tender frame ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
The weakness we lament , ourselves create ; Instructed , from our infant years , to court , With counterfeited fears , the aid of man , We learn to shudder at the rustling breeze , Start at the light , and tremble in the dark ; Till , affectation ripening to belief , And folly , frighted at her own chimeras , Habitual cowardice usurps the soul .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Not all , like thee , can brave the shocks of fate .
Thy soul , by nature great , enlarg'd by knowledge , Soars unincumber'd with our idle cares , And all Aspasia , but her beauty 's man .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Each gen ` rous sentiment is thine , Demetrius , Whose soul , perhaps , yet mindful of Aspasia , Now hovers o'er this melancholy shade , Well pleas'd to find thy precepts not forgotten .
Oh !
could the grave restore the pious hero , Soon would his art or valour set us free , And bear us far from servitude and crimes .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
He yet may live .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Alas !
delusive dream !
Too well I know him ; his immoderate courage , Th ' impetuous sallies of excessive virtue , Too strong for love , have hurried him on death .
</p>
<p>
SCENE II .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA , IRENE , CALI , ABDALLA .
</p>
<p>
CALI to ABDALLA , as they advance .
Behold our future sultaness , Abdalla ; -- Let artful flatt ` ry now , to lull suspicion , Glide , through Irene , to the sultan 's ear .
Would ` st thou subdue th ' obdurate cannibal To tender friendship , praise him to his mistress .
</p>
<p>
[ To IRENE . ]
</p>
<p>
Well may those eyes , that view these heav ` nly charms , Reject the daughters of contending kings ; For what are pompous titles , proud alliance , Empire or wealth , to excellence like thine ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Receive th ' impatient sultan to thy arms ; And may a long posterity of monarchs , The pride and terrour of succeeding days , Rise from the happy bed ; and future queens Diffuse Irene 's beauty through the world !
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Can Mahomet 's imperial hand descend To clasp a slave ?
or can a soul , like mine , Unus'd to pow ` r , and form'd for humbler scenes , Support the splendid miseries of greatness ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
No regal pageant , deck'd with casual honours , Scorn'd by his subjects , trampled by his foes ; No feeble tyrant of a petty state , Courts thee to shake on a dependant throne ; Born to command , as thou to charm mankind , The sultan from himself derives his greatness .
Observe , bright maid , as his resistless voice Drives on the tempest of destructive war , How nation after nation falls before him .
</p>

ABDALLA .
At his dread name the distant mountains shake Their cloudy summits , and the sons of fierceness , That range uncivilized from rock to rock , Distrust th ' eternal fortresses of nature , And wish their gloomy caverns more obscure .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Forbear this lavish pomp of dreadful praise ; The horrid images of war and slaughter Renew our sorrows , and awake our fears .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Cali , methinks yon waving trees afford A doubtful glimpse of our approaching friends ; Just as I mark'd them , they forsook the shore , And turn'd their hasty steps towards the garden .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Conduct these queens , Abdalla , to the palace : Such heav ` nly beauty , form'd for adoration , The pride of monarchs , the reward of conquest !
Such beauty must not shine to vulgar eyes .
</p>
<p>
SCENE III .
</p>
<p>
CALI , solus .
</p>
<p>
How heav ` n , in scorn of human arrogance , Commits to trivial chance the fate of nations !
While , with incessant thought , laborious man Extends his mighty schemes of wealth and pow ` r , And towers and triumphs in ideal greatness ; Some accidental gust of opposition Blasts all the beauties of his new creation , O'erturns the fabrick of presumptuous reason , And whelms the swelling architect beneath it .
Had not the breeze untwin'd the meeting boughs , And , through the parted shade , disclos'd the Greeks , Th ' important hour had pass'd , unheeded , by , In all the sweet oblivion of delight , In all the fopperies of meeting lovers ; In sighs and tears , in transports and embraces , In soft complaints , and idle protestations .

<p>
SCENE IV .

<p>
CALI , DEMETRIUS , LEONTIUS .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Could omens fright the resolute and wise , Well might we fear impending disappointments .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Your artful suit , your monarch 's fierce denial , The cruel doom of hapless Menodorus --
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
And your new charge , that dear , that heav ` nly maid --
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
All this we know already from Abdalla .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Such slight defeats but animate the brave To stronger efforts and maturer counsels .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
My doom confirm'd establishes my purpose .
Calmly he heard , till Amurath 's resumption Rose to his thought , and set his soul on fire : When from his lips the fatal name burst out , A sudden pause th ' imperfect sense suspended , Like the dread stillness of condensing storms .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
The loudest cries of nature urge us forward ; Despotick rage pursues the life of Cali ; His groaning country claims Leontius ' aid ; And yet another voice , forgive me , Greece , The pow ` rful voice of love , inflames Demetrius ; Each ling ` ring hour alarms me for Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
What passions reign among thy crew , Leontius ?
Does cheerless diffidence oppress their hearts ?
Or sprightly hope exalt their kindling spirits ?
Do they , with pain , repress the struggling shout , And listen eager to the rising wind ?
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
All there is hope , and gaiety , and courage , No cloudy doubts , or languishing delays ; Ere I could range them on the crowded deck , At once a hundred voices thunder'd round me , And ev'ry voice was liberty and Greece .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Swift let us rush upon the careless tyrant , Nor give him leisure for another crime .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Then let us now resolve , nor idly waste Another hour in dull deliberation .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
But see , where destin'd to protract our counsels , Comes Mustapha .
-- Your Turkish robes conceal you .
Retire with speed , while I prepare to meet him With artificial smiles , and seeming friendship .

SCENE V .
</p>
<p>
CALI , MUSTAPHA .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
I see the gloom , that low ` rs upon thy brow ; These days of love and pleasure charm not thee ; Too slow these gentle constellations roll ; Thou long ` st for stars , that frown on human kind , And scatter discord from their baleful beams .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
How blest art thou , still jocund and serene , Beneath the load of business , and of years !
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Sure , by some wond ` rous sympathy of souls , My heart still beats responsive to the sultan 's ; I share , by secret instinct , all his joys , And feel no sorrow , while my sov ` reign smiles .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
The sultan comes , impatient for his love ; Conduct her hither ; let no rude intrusion Molest these private walks , or care invade These hours , assign'd to pleasure and Irene .

<p>
MAHOMET , MUSTAPHA .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Now , Mustapha , pursue thy tale of horrour .
Has treason 's dire infection reach'd my palace ?
Can Cali dare the stroke of heav ` nly justice , In the dark precincts of the gaping grave , And load with perjuries his parting soul ?
Was it for this , that , sick'ningin Epirus , My father call'd me to his couch of death , Join'd Cali 's hand to mine , and falt ` ring cried , Restrain the fervour of impetuous youth With venerable Cali 's faithful counsels ?
Are these the counsels , this the faith of Cali ?
Were all our favours lavish'd on a villain ?
Confest ?
--
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Confest by dying Menodorus .
In his last agonies , the gasping coward , Amidst the tortures of the burning steel , Still fond of life , groan'd out the dreadful secret , Held forth this fatal scroll , then sunk to nothing .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
examining the paper .
His correspondence with our foes of Greece !
His hand !
his seal !
The secrets of my soul , Conceal'd from all but him !
All , all conspire To banish doubt , and brand him for a villain !
Our schemes for ever cross'd , our mines discover'd , Betray'd some traitor lurking near my bosom .
Oft have I rag'd , when their wide-wasting cannon Lay pointed at our batt ` ries yet unform'd , And broke the meditated lines of war .
Detested Cali , too , with artful wonder , Would shake his wily head , and closely whisper , Beware of Mustapha , beware of treason .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
The faith of Mustapha disdains suspicion ; But yet , great emperour , beware of treason ; Th ' insidious bassa , fir'd by disappointment --
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Shall feel the vengeance of an injur'd king .
Go , seize him , load him with reproachful chains ; Before th ' assembled troops , proclaim his crimes ; Then leave him , stretch'd upon the ling ` ring rack , Amidst the camp to howl his life away .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Should we , before the troops , proclaim his crimes , I dread his arts of seeming innocence , His bland address , and sorcery of tongue ; And , should he fall , unheard , by sudden justice , Th ' adoring soldiers would revenge their idol .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Cali , this day , with hypocritick zeal , Implor'd my leave to visit Mecca 's temple ; Struck with the wonder of a statesman 's goodness , I rais'd his thoughts to more sublime devotion .
Now let him go , pursu'd by silent wrath , Meet unexpected daggers in his way , And , in some distant land , obscurely die .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
There will his boundless wealth , the spoil of Asia , Heap'd by your father 's ill-plac'd bounties on him , Disperse rebellion through the eastern world ; Bribe to his cause , and list beneath his banners , Arabia 's roving troops , the sons of swiftness , And arm the Persian heretick against thee ; There shall he waste thy frontiers , check thy conquests , And , though at length subdued , elude thy vengeance .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Elude my vengeance !
No -- My troops shall range Th ' eternal snows that freeze beyond Maeotis , And Africk 's torrid sands , in search of Cali .
Should the fierce north , upon his frozen wings , Bear him aloft , above the wond ` ring clouds , And seat him in the pleiads ' golden chariots , Thence shall my fury drag him down to tortures ; Wherever guilt can fly , revenge can follow .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Wilt thou dismiss the savage from the toils , Only to hunt him round the ravag'd world ?
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Suspend his sentence -- Empire and Irene Claim my divided soul .
This wretch , unworthy To mix with nobler cares , I 'll throw aside For idle hours , and crush him at my leisure .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Let not th ' unbounded greatness of his mind Betray my king to negligence of danger .
Perhaps , the clouds of dark conspiracy Now roll , full fraught with thunder , o'er your head .
Twice , since the morning rose , I saw the bassa , Like a fell adder swelling in a brake , Beneath the covert of this verdant arch , In private conference ; beside him stood Two men unknown , the partners of his bosom ; I mark'd them well , and trac'd in either face The gloomy resolution , horrid greatness , And stern composure , of despairing heroes ; And , to confirm my thoughts , at sight of me , As blasted by my presence , they withdrew , With all the speed of terrour and of guilt .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
The strong emotions of my troubled soul Allow no pause for art or for contrivance ; And dark perplexity distracts my counsels .
Do thou resolve : for , see , Irene comes !
At her approach each ruder gust of thought Sinks , like the sighing of a tempest spent , And gales of softer passion fan my bosom .

SCENE VII .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET , IRENE .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Wilt thou descend , fair daughter of perfection , To hear my vows , and give mankind a queen ?
Ah !
cease , Irene , cease those flowing sorrows , That melt a heart impregnable till now , And turn thy thoughts , henceforth , to love and empire .
How will the matchless beauties of Irene , Thus bright in tears , thus amiable in ruin , With all the graceful pride of greatness heighten'd , Amidst the blaze of jewels and of gold , Adorn a throne , and dignify dominion !
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Why all this glare of splendid eloquence , To paint the pageantries of guilty state ?
Must I , for these , renounce the hope of heav ` n , Immortal crowns , and fulness of enjoyment ?
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Vain raptures all -- For your inferiour natures , Form'd to delight , and happy by delighting , Heav'n has reserv'd no future paradise , But bids you rove the paths of bliss , secure Of total death , and careless of hereafter ; While heaven 's high minister , whose awful volume Records each act , each thought of sov ` reign man , Surveys your plays with inattentive glance , And leaves the lovely trifler unregarded .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Why then has nature 's vain munificence Profusely pour'd her bounties upon woman ?
Whence , then , those charms thy tongue has deign'd to flatter , That air resistless , and enchanting blush , Unless the beauteous fabrick was design'd A habitation for a fairer soul ?
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Too high , bright maid , thou rat ` st exteriour grace : Not always do the fairest flow ` rs diffuse The richest odours , nor the speckled shells Conceal the gem ; let female arrogance Observe the feather'd wand ` rers of the sky ; With purple varied , and bedrop'd with gold , They prune the wing , and spread the glossy plumes , Ordain'd , like you , to flutter and to shine , And cheer the weary passenger with musick .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Mean as we are , this tyrant of the world Implores our smiles , and trembles at our feet .
Whence flow the hopes and fears , despair and rapture , Whence all the bliss and agonies of love ?
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Why , when the balm of sleep descends on man , Do gay delusions , wand ` ring o'er the brain , Sooth the delighted soul with empty bliss ?
To want , give affluence ?
and to slav ` ry , freedom ?
Such are love 's joys , the lenitives of life , A fancy'd treasure , and a waking dream .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Then let me once , in honour of our sex , Assume the boastful arrogance of man .
Th ' attractive softness , and th ' endearing smile , And pow ` rful glance , 't is granted , are our own ; Nor has impartial nature 's frugal hand Exhausted all her nobler gifts on you .
Do not we share the comprehensive thought , Th ' enlivening wit , the penetrating reason ?
Beats not the female breast with gen ` rous passions , The thirst of empire , and the love of glory ?
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Illustrious maid , new wonders fix me thine ; Thy soul completes the triumphs of thy face .
I thought ( forgive , my fair , ) the noblest aim , The strongest effort of a female soul , Was but to choose the graces of the day ; To tune the tongue , to teach the eyes to roll , Dispose the colours of the flowing robe , And add new roses to the faded cheek .
Will it not charm a mind , like thine , exalted , To shine , the goddess of applauding nations ; To scatter happiness and plenty round thee , To bid the prostrate captive rise and live , To see new cities tow ` r , at thy command , And blasted kingdoms flourish , at thy smile ?
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Charm'd with the thought of blessing human kind , Too calm I listen to the flatt ` ring sounds .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
O !
seize the power to bless -- Irene 's nod Shall break the fetters of the groaning Christian ; Greece , in her lovely patroness secure , Shall mourn no more her plunder'd palaces .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Forbear -- O !
do not urge me to my ruin !
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
To state and pow ' r I court thee , not to ruin : Smile on my wishes , and command the globe .
Security shall spread her shield before thee , And love infold thee with his downy wings .
If greatness please thee , mount th ' imperial seat ; If pleasure charm thee , view this soft retreat ; Here ev'ry warbler of the sky shall sing ; Here ev'ry fragrance breathe of ev'ry spring : To deck these bow ` rs each region shall combine , And e ` en our prophet 's gardens envy thine : Empire and love shall share the blissful day , And varied life steal , unperceiv'd , away .

ACT III .
-- SCENE I .
</p>
<p>
CALI , ABDALLA .
</p>
<p>
[ CALI enters , with a discontented air ; to him enters ABDALLA . ]
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Is this the fierce conspirator , Abdalla ?
Is this the restless diligence of treason ?
Where hast thou linger'd , while th ' incumber'd hours Fly , lab ` ring with the fate of future nations , And hungry slaughter scents imperial blood ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Important cares detain'd me from your counsels .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Some petty passion !
some domestick trifle !
Some vain amusement of a vacant soul !
A weeping wife , perhaps , or dying friend , Hung on your neck , and hinder'd your departure .
Is this a time for softness or for sorrow ?
Unprofitable , peaceful , female virtues !
When eager vengeance shows a naked foe , And kind ambition points the way to greatness .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Must then ambition 's votaries infringe The laws of kindness , break the bonds of nature , And quit the names of brother , friend , and father ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
This sov ` reign passion , scornful of restraint , E'en from the birth , affects supreme command , Swells in the breast , and , with resistless force , O'erbears each gentler motion of the mind : As , when a deluge overspreads the plains , The wand ` ring rivulet , and silver lake , Mix undistinguish'd with the gen ` ral roar .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Yet can ambition , in Abdalla 's breast , Claim but the second place : there mighty love Has fix'd his hopes , inquietudes , and fears , His glowing wishes , and his jealous pangs .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Love is , indeed , the privilege of youth ; Yet , on a day like this , when expectation Pants for the dread event -- But let us reason --
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Hast thou grown old , amidst the crowd of courts , And turn'd th ' instructive page of human life , To cant , at last , of reason to a lover ?
Such ill-tim'd gravity , such serious folly , Might well befit the solitary student , Th ' unpractis'd dervis , or sequester'd faquir .
Know ` st thou not yet , when love invades the soul , That all her faculties receive his chains ?
That reason gives her sceptre to his hand , Or only struggles to be more enslav'd ?
Aspasia , who can look upon thy beauties ?
Who hear thee speak , and not abandon reason ?
Reason !
the hoary dotard 's dull directress , That loses all , because she hazards nothing !
Reason !
the tim ` rous pilot , that , to shun The rocks of life , for ever flies the port !
</p>
<p>
CALI .
But why this sudden warmth ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Because I love : Because my slighted passion burns in vain !
Why roars the lioness , distress'd by hunger ?
Why foam the swelling waves , when tempests rise ?
Why shakes the ground , when subterraneous fires Fierce through the bursting caverns rend their way ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Not till this day , thou saw ` st this fatal fair ; Did ever passion make so swift a progress ?
Once more reflect ; suppress this infant folly .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Gross fires , enkindled by a mortal hand , Spread , by degrees , and dread th ' oppressing stream ; The subtler flames , emitted from the sky , Flash out at once , with strength above resistance .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
How did Aspasia welcome your address ?
Did you proclaim this unexpected conquest ?
Or pay , with speaking eyes , a lover 's homage ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Confounded , aw'd , and lost in admiration , I gaz'd , I trembled ; but I could not speak ; When e ` en , as love was breaking off from wonder , And tender accents quiver'd on my lips , She mark'd my sparkling eyes , and heaving breast , And smiling , conscious of her charms , withdrew .
</p>
<p>
[ Enter Demetrius and Leontius .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Now be , some moments , master of thyself ; Nor let Demetrius know thee for a rival .
Hence !
or be calm -- To disagree is ruin .

<p>
SCENE II .
</p>
<p>
CALI , DEMETRIUS , LEONTIUS , ABDALLA .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
When will occasion smile upon our wishes , And give the tortures of suspense a period ?
Still must we linger in uncertain hope ?
Still languish in our chains , and dream of freedom , Like thirsty sailors gazing on the clouds , Till burning death shoots through their wither'd limbs ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Deliverance is at hand ; for Turkey 's tyrant , Sunk in his pleasures , confident and gay , With all the hero 's dull security , Trusts to my care his mistress and his life , And laughs , and wantons in the jaws of death .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
So weak is man , when destin'd to destruction !
-- The watchful slumber , and the crafty trust .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
At my command , yon iron gates unfold ; At my command , the sentinels retire ; With all the license of authority , Through bowing slaves , I range the private rooms , And of to-morrow 's action fix the scene .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
To-morrow 's action !
Can that hoary wisdom , Borne down with years , still dote upon to-morrow ?
That fatal mistress of the young , the lazy , The coward , and the fool , condemn'd to lose An useless life , in waiting for to-morrow , To gaze with longing eyes upon to-morrow , Till interposing death destroys the prospect !
Strange !
that this gen ` ral fraud , from day to day , Should fill the world with wretches undetected .
The soldier , lab ` ring through a winter 's march , Still sees to-morrow drest in robes of triumph ; Still to the lover 's long-expecting arms To-morrow brings the visionary bride .
But thou , too old to bear another cheat , Learn , that the present hour alone is man 's .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
The present hour , with open arms , invites ; Seize the kind fair , and press her to thy bosom .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Who knows , ere this important morrow rise , But fear or mutiny may taint the Greeks ?
Who knows , if Mahomet 's awaking anger May spare the fatal bowstring till to-morrow ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Had our first Asian foes but known this ardour , We still had wander'd on Tartarian hills .
Rouse , Cali ; shall the sons of conquer'd Greece Lead us to danger , and abash their victors ?
This night , with all her conscious stars , be witness , Who merits most , Demetrius or Abdalla .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Who merits most !
-- I knew not , we were rivals .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Young man , forbear -- the heat of youth , no more -- Well , -- 't is decreed -- This night shall fix our fate .
Soon as the veil of ev'ningclouds the sky , With cautious secrecy , Leontius , steer Th ' appointed vessel to yon shaded bay , Form'd by this garden jutting on the deep ; There , with your soldiers arm'd , and sails expanded , Await our coming , equally prepar'd For speedy flight , or obstinate defence .

DEMETRIUS .
Now pause , great bassa , from the thoughts of blood , And kindly grant an ear to gentler sounds .
If e'er thy youth has known the pangs of absence , Or felt th ' impatience of obstructed love , Give me , before th ' approaching hour of fate , Once to behold the charms of bright Aspasia , And draw new virtue from her heav ` nly tongue .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Let prudence , ere the suit be farther urg'd , Impartial weigh the pleasure with the danger .
A little longer , and she 's thine for ever .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Prudence and love conspire in this request , Lest , unacquainted with our bold attempt , Surprise o'erwhelm her , and retard our flight .
</p>

ABDALLA .
And this is my reward -- to burn , to languish , To rave , unheeded ; while the happy Greek , The refuse of our swords , the dross of conquest , Throws his fond arms about Aspasia 's neck , Dwells on her lips , and sighs upon her breast .
Is 't not enough , he lives by our indulgence , But he must live to make his masters wretched ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
What claim hast thou to plead ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .

ABDALLA .
Can then th ' assassin lift his treach ` rous hand Against his king , and cry , remember justice ?

MAHOMET .
My vows , 't is true , she hears with less aversion ; She sighs , she blushes , but she still denies .
</p>

CALI .
With warmer courtship press the yielding fair : Call to your aid , with boundless promises , Each rebel wish , each traitor inclination , That raises tumults in the female breast , The love of pow ` r , of pleasure , and of show .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
These arts I try'd , and , to inflame her more , By hateful business hurried from her sight , I bade a hundred virgins wait around her , Sooth her with all the pleasures of command , Applaud her charms , and court her to be great .

-- Our distant int ` rests , and our diff ` rent passions .
Now haste to mingle in one common centre .
And fate lies crowded in a narrow space .
Yet , in that narrow space what dangers rise !
-- Far more I dread Abdalla 's fiery folly , Than all the wisdom of the grave divan .
Reason with reason fights on equal terms ; The raging madman 's unconnected schemes We can not obviate , for we can not guess .
Deep in my breast be treasur'd this resolve , When Cali mounts the throne , Abdalla dies , Too fierce , too faithless , for neglect or trust .

</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
The soul , once tainted with so foul a crime , No more shall glow with friendship 's hallow'd ardour : Those holy beings , whose superiour care Guides erring mortals to the paths of virtue , Affrighted at impiety , like thine , Resign their charge to baseness and to ruin [ a ] .
</p>
<p>
[ a ] In the original copy of this tragedy , given to Mr. Langton , the above speech is as follows ; and , in Mr. Boswell 's judgment , is finer than in the present editions :
</p>
<p>
`` Nor think to say , here will I stop ; Here will I fix the limits of transgression , Nor farther tempt the avenging rage of heaven .
When guilt , like this , once harbours in the breast , Those holy beings , whose unseen direction Guides , through the maze of life , the steps of man .
Fly the detested mansions of impiety , And quit their charge to horrour and to ruin . ''

-- ED .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Upbraid me not with fancied wickedness ; I am not yet a queen , or an apostate .
But should I sin beyond the hope of mercy , If , when religion prompts me to refuse , The dread of instant death restrains my tongue ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Reflect , that life and death , affecting sounds !
Are only varied modes of endless being ; Reflect , that life , like ev'ry other blessing , Derives its value from its use alone ; Not for itself , but for a nobler end , Th ' Eternal gave it , and that end is virtue .
When inconsistent with a greater good , Reason commands to cast the less away : Thus life , with loss of wealth , is well preserv'd , And virtue cheaply say'd , with loss of life .

If built on settled thought , this constancy Not idly flutters on a boastful tongue , Why , when destruction rag'd around our walls , Why fled this haughty heroine from the battle ?
Why , then , did not this warlike amazon Mix in the war , and shine among the heroes ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Heav ` n , when its hand pour'd softness on our limbs , Unfit for toil , and polish'd into weakness , Made passive fortitude the praise of woman : Our only arms are innocence and meekness .
Not then with raving cries I fill'd the city ; But , while Demetrius , dear , lamented name !
Pour'd storms of fire upon our fierce invaders , Implor'd th ' eternal pow ' r to shield my country , With silent sorrows , and with calm devotion .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
O !
did Irene shine the queen of Turkey , No more should Greece lament those pray ` rs rejected ; Again , should golden splendour grace her cities , Again , her prostrate palaces should rise , Again , her temples sound with holy musick : No more should danger fright , or want distress The smiling widows , and protected orphans .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Be virtuous ends pursued by virtuous means , Nor think th ' intention sanctifies the deed : That maxim , publish'd in an impious age , Would loose the wild enthusiast to destroy , And fix the fierce usurper 's bloody title ; Then bigotry might send her slaves to war , And bid success become the test of truth : Unpitying massacre might waste the world , And persecution boast the call of heaven .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Shall I not wish to cheer afflicted kings , And plan the happiness of mourning millions ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Dream not of pow ` r , thou never canst attain : When social laws first harmoniz'd the world , Superiour man possess'd the charge of rule , The scale of justice , and the sword of power , Nor left us aught , but flattery and state .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
To me my lover 's fondness will restore Whate'er man 's pride has ravish'd from our sex .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
When soft security shall prompt the sultan , Freed from the tumults of unsettled conquest , To fix his court , and regulate his pleasures , Soon shall the dire seraglio 's horrid gates Close , like th ' eternal bars of death , upon thee .
Immur'd , and buried in perpetual sloth , That gloomy slumber of the stagnant soul , There shalt thou view , from far , the quiet cottage , And sigh for cheerful poverty in vain ; There wear the tedious hours of life away , Beneath each curse of unrelenting heav ` n , Despair and slav ` ry , solitude and guilt .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
There shall we find the yet untasted bliss Of grandeur and tranquillity combin'd .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Tranquillity and guilt , disjoin'd by heaven , Still stretch in vain their longing arms afar ; Nor dare to pass th ' insuperable bound .
Ah !
let me rather seek the convent 's cell ; There , when my thoughts , at interval of prayer , Descend to range these mansions of misfortune , Oft shall I dwell on our disastrous friendship , And shed the pitying tear for lost Irene .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Go , languish on in dull obscurity ; Thy dazzled soul , with all its boasted greatness , Shrinks at th ' o'erpow ` ring gleams of regal state , Stoops from the blaze , like a degen ` rate eagle , And flies for shelter to the shades of life .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
On me should providence , without a crime , The weighty charge of royalty confer ; Call me to civilize the Russian wilds , Or bid soft science polish Britain 's heroes ; Soon should ` st thou see , how false thy weak reproach , My bosom feels , enkindled from the sky , The lambent flames of mild benevolence , Untouch'd by fierce ambition 's raging fires .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Ambition is the stamp , impress'd by heav'n To mark the noblest minds ; with active heat Inform'd , they mount the precipice of pow ` r , Grasp at command , and tow ' r in quest of empire ; While vulgar souls compassionate their cares , Gaze at their height , and tremble at their danger : Thus meaner spirits , with amazement , mark The varying seasons , and revolving skies , And ask , what guilty pow ` r 's rebellious hand Rolls with eternal toil the pond ` rous orbs ; While some archangel , nearer to perfection , In easy state , presides o'er all their motions , Directs the planets , with a careless nod , Conducts the sun , and regulates the spheres .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Well may ` st thou hide in labyrinths of sound The cause that shrinks from reason 's pow ` rful voice .
Stoop from thy flight , trace back th ' entangled thought , And set the glitt ` ring fallacy to view .
Not pow ' r I blame , but pow ' r obtain'd by crime ; Angelick greatness is angelick virtue .
Amidst the glare of courts , the shout of armies , Will not th ' apostate feel the pangs of guilt , And wish , too late , for innocence and peace , Curst , as the tyrant of th ' infernal realms , With gloomy state and agonizing pomp ?

<p>
IRENE , ASPASIA , MAID .
</p>
<p>
MAID .
A Turkish stranger , of majestick mien , Asks at the gate admission to Aspasia , Commission'd , as he says , by Cali bassa .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Whoe'er thou art , or whatsoe'er thy message , [ Aside .
Thanks for this kind relief -- With speed admit him .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
He comes , perhaps , to separate us for ever ; When I am gone , remember , O !
remember , That none are great , or happy , but the virtuous .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Irene ; enter Demetrius .

SCENE X .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA , DEMETRIUS .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
'T is she -- my hope , my happiness , my love !
Aspasia !
do I , once again , behold thee ?
Still , still the same -- unclouded by misfortune !
Let my blest eyes for ever gaze --
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Demetrius !
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Why does the blood forsake thy lovely cheek ?
Why shoots this chilness through thy shaking nerves ?
Why does thy soul retire into herself ?
Recline upon my breast thy sinking beauties : Revive -- Revive to freedom and to love .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
What well-known voice pronounc'd the grateful sounds , Freedom and love ?
Alas !
I 'm all confusion ; A sudden mist o'ercasts my darken'd soul ; The present , past , and future swim before me , Lost in a wild perplexity of joy .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Such ecstasy of love , such pure affection , What worth can merit ?
or what faith reward ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
A thousand thoughts , imperfect and distracted , Demand a voice , and struggle into birth ; A thousand questions press upon my tongue , But all give way to rapture and Demetrius .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
O say , bright being , in this age of absence , What fears , what griefs , what dangers , hast thou known ?
Say , how the tyrant threaten'd , flatter'd , sigh'd !
Say , how he threaten'd , flatter'd , sigh'd in vain !
Say , how the hand of violence was rais'd !
Say, how thou call'dst in tears upon Demetrius !
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Inform me rather , how thy happy courage Stemm'd in the breach the deluge of destruction , And pass'd , uninjur'd , through the walks of death .
Did savage anger and licentious conquest Behold the hero with Aspasia 's eyes ?
And , thus protected in the gen ` ral ruin , O !
say , what guardian pow ' r convey'd thee hither .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Such strange events , such unexpected chances , Beyond my warmest hope , or wildest wishes , Concurr'd to give me to Aspasia 's arms , I stand amaz'd , and ask , if yet I clasp thee .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Sure heav ` n , ( for wonders are not wrought in vain ! )
That joins us thus , will never part us more .
</p>
<p>
SCENE XI .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS , ASPASIA , ABDALLA .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
It parts you now -- The hasty sultan sign'd The laws unread , and flies to his Irene .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Fix'd and intent on his Irene 's charms , He envies none the converse of Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Aspasia 's absence will inflame suspicion ; She can not , must not , shall not , linger here ; Prudence and friendship bid me force her from you .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Force her !
profane her with a touch , and die !
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
'T is Greece , 't is freedom , calls Aspasia hence ; Your careless love betrays your country 's cause .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
If we must part --
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
No !
let us die together .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
If we must part --
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Despatch ; th ' increasing danger Will not admit a lover 's long farewell , The long-drawn intercourse of sighs and kisses .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Then -- O !
my fair , I can not bid thee go .
Receive her , and protect her , gracious heav ` n !
Yet let me watch her dear departing steps ; If fate pursues me , let it find me here .
Reproach not , Greece , a lover 's fond delays , Nor think thy cause neglected , while I gaze ; New force , new courage , from each glance I gain , And find our passions not infus'd in vain .
[ Exeunt .
</p>
<p>
ACT IV .
-- SCENE I .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS , ASPASIA , enter as talking .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Enough -- resistless reason calms my soul -- Approving justice smiles upon your cause , And nature 's rights entreat th ' asserting sword .
Yet , when your hand is lifted to destroy , Think , but excuse a woman 's needless caution , -- Purge well thy mind from ev'ry private passion , Drive int ` rest , love , and vengeance , from thy thoughts ; Fill all thy ardent breast with Greece and virtue ; Then strike secure , and heav'n assist the blow !
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Thou kind assistant of my better angel , Propitious guide of my bewilder'd soul , Calm of my cares , and guardian of my virtue !
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
My soul , first kindled by thy bright example , To noble thought and gen ` rous emulation , Now but reflects those beams that flow'd from thee .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
With native lustre and unborrow'd greatness , Thou shin ` st , bright maid , superiour to distress ; Unlike the trifling race of vulgar beauties , Those glitt ` ring dewdrops of a vernal morn , That spread their colours to the genial beam , And , sparkling , quiver to the breath of May ; But , when the tempest , with sonorous wing , Sweeps o'er the grove , forsake the lab ` ring bough , Dispers'd in air , or mingled with the dust .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Forbear this triumph -- still new conflicts wait us , Foes unforeseen , and dangers unsuspected .
Oft , when the fierce besiegers ' eager host Beholds the fainting garrison retire , And rushes joyful to the naked wall , Destruction flashes from th ' insidious mine , And sweeps th ' exulting conqueror away .
Perhaps , in vain the sultan 's anger spar'd me , To find a meaner fate from treach ` rous friendship -- Abdalla !
--
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Can Abdalla then dissemble !
That fiery chief , renown'd for gen ` rous freedom , For zeal unguarded , undissembled hate , For daring truth , and turbulence of honour !
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
This open friend , this undesigning hero , With noisy falsehoods , forc'd me from your arms , To shock my virtue with a tale of love .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Did not the cause of Greece restrain my sword , Aspasia should not fear a second insult .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
His pride and love , by turns , inspir'd his tongue , And intermix'd my praises with his own ; His wealth , his rank , his honours , he recounted , Till , in the midst of arrogance and fondness , Th ' approaching sultan forc'd me from the palace ; Then , while he gaz'd upon his yielding mistress , I stole , unheeded , from their ravish'd eyes , And sought this happy grove in quest of thee .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Soon may the final stroke decide our fate , Lest baleful discord crush our infant scheme , And strangled freedom perish in the birth !
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
My bosom , harass'd with alternate passions , Now hopes , now fears --
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Th ' anxieties of love .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Think , how the sov ` reign arbiter of kingdoms Detests thy false associates ' black designs , And frowns on perjury , revenge , and murder .
Embark'd with treason on the seas of fate , When heaven shall bid the swelling billows rage , And point vindictive lightnings at rebellion , Will not the patriot share the traitor 's danger ?
Oh !
could thy hand , unaided , free thy country , Nor mingled guilt pollute the sacred cause !
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Permitted oft , though not inspir'd , by heaven , Successful treasons punish impious kings .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Nor end my terrours with the sultan 's death ; Far as futurity 's untravell'd waste Lies open to conjecture 's dubious ken , On ev'ry side confusion , rage , and death , Perhaps , the phantoms of a woman 's fear , Beset the treach ` rous way with fatal ambush ; Each Turkish bosom burns for thy destruction , Ambitious Cali dreads the statesman 's arts , And hot Abdalla hates the happy lover .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Capricious man !
to good and ill inconstant , Too much to fear or trust is equal weakness .
Sometimes the wretch , unaw'd by heav'n or hell , With mad devotion idolizes honour .
The bassa , reeking with his master 's murder , Perhaps , may start at violated friendship .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
How soon , alas !
will int ` rest , fear , or envy , O'erthrow such weak , such accidental virtue , Nor built on faith , nor fortified by conscience !
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
When desp ` rate ills demand a speedy cure , Distrust is cowardice , and prudence folly .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Yet , think a moment , ere you court destruction , What hand , when death has snatch'd away Demetrius , Shall guard Aspasia from triumphant lust .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Dismiss these needless fears -- a troop of Greeks , Well known , long try'd , expect us on the shore .
Borne on the surface of the smiling deep , Soon shalt thou scorn , in safety 's arms repos'd , Abdalla 's rage and Cali 's stratagems .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Still , still , distrust sits heavy on my heart .
Will e'er a happier hour revisit Greece ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Should heav ` n , yet unappeas'd , refuse its aid , Disperse our hopes , and frustrate our designs , Yet shall the conscience of the great attempt Diffuse a brightness on our future days ; Nor will his country 's groans reproach Demetrius .
But how canst thou support the woes of exile ?
Canst thou forget hereditary splendours , To live obscure upon a foreign coast , Content with science , innocence , and love ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Nor wealth , nor titles , make Aspasia 's bliss .
O'erwhelm'd and lost amidst the publick ruins , Unmov'd , I saw the glitt ` ring trifles perish , And thought the petty dross beneath a sigh .
Cheerful I follow to the rural cell ; Love be my wealth , and my distinction virtue .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Submissive , and prepar'd for each event , Now let us wait the last award of heav ` n , Secure of happiness from flight or conquest ; Nor fear the fair and learn'd can want protection .
The mighty Tuscan courts the banish'd arts To kind Italia 's hospitable shades ; There shall soft leisure wing th ' excursive soul , And peace , propitious , smile on fond desire ; There shall despotick eloquence resume Her ancient empire o'er the yielding heart ; There poetry shall tune her sacred voice , And wake from ignorance the western world .
</p>
<p>
SCENE II .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS , ASPASIA , CALI .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
At length th ' unwilling sun resigns the world To silence and to rest .
The hours of darkness , Propitious hours to stratagem and death , Pursue the last remains of ling ` ring light .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Count not these hours , as parts of vulgar time ; Think them a sacred treasure lent by heaven , Which , squander'd by neglect , or fear , or folly , No prayer recalls , no diligence redeems .
To-morrow 's dawn shall see the Turkish king Stretch'd in the dust , or tow ` ring on his throne ; To-morrow 's dawn shall see the mighty Cali The sport of tyranny , or lord of nations .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Then waste no longer these important moments In soft endearments , and in gentle murmurs ; Nor lose , in love , the patriot and the hero .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
'T is love , combin'd with guilt alone , that melts The soften'd soul to cowardice and sloth ; But virtuous passion prompts the great resolve , And fans the slumbering spark of heavenly fire .
Retire , my fair ; that pow ' r that smiles on goodness , Guide all thy steps , calm ev'ry stormy thought , And still thy bosom with the voice of peace !
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Soon may we meet again , secure and free , To feel no more the pangs of separation !
[ Exit .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS , CALI .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
This night alone is ours -- Our mighty foe , No longer lost in am ` rous solitude , Will now remount the slighted seat of empire , And show Irene to the shouting people : Aspasia left her , sighing in his arms , And list'ningto the pleasing tale of pow ` r ; With soften'd voice she dropp'd the faint refusal , Smiling consent she sat , and blushing love .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Now , tyrant , with satiety of beauty Now feast thine eyes ; thine eyes , that ne'er hereafter Shall dart their am ` rous glances at the fair , Or glare on Cali with malignant beams .

DEMETRIUS , CALI , LEONTIUS , ABDALLA .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Our bark , unseen , has reach'd th ' appointed bay , And , where yon trees wave o'er the foaming surge , Reclines against the shore : our Grecian troop Extends its lines along the sandy beach , Elate with hope , and panting for a foe .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
The fav ` ring winds assist the great design , Sport in our sails , and murmur o'er the deep .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
'T is well -- A single blow completes our wishes ; Return with speed , Leontius , to your charge ; The Greeks , disorder'd by their leader 's absence , May droop dismay'd , or kindle into madness .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Suspected still !
-- What villain 's pois ` nous tongue Dares join Leontius ' name with fear or falsehood ?
Have I for this preserv'd my guiltless bosom , Pure as the thoughts of infant innocence ?
Have I for this defy'd the chiefs of Turkey , Intrepid in the flaming front of war ?
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Hast thou not search'd my soul 's profoundest thoughts ?
Is not the fate of Greece and Cali thine ?
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Why has thy choice then pointed out Leontius , Unfit to share this night 's illustrious toils ?
To wait , remote from action , and from honour , An idle list ` ner to the distant cries Of slaughter'd infidels , and clash of swords ?
Tell me the cause , that while thy name , Demetrius , Shall soar , triumphant on the wings of glory , Despis'd and curs'd , Leontius must descend Through hissing ages , a proverbial coward , The tale of women , and the scorn of fools ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Can brave Leontius be the slave of glory ?
Glory , the casual gift of thoughtless crowds !
Glory , the bribe of avaricious virtue !
Be but my country free , be thine the praise ; I ask no witness , but attesting conscience , No records , but the records of the sky .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
Wilt thou then head the troop upon the shore , While I destroy th ' oppressor of mankind ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
What canst thou boast superiour to Demetrius ?
Ask , to whose sword the Greeks will trust their cause , My name shall echo through the shouting field : Demand , whose force yon Turkish heroes dread , The shudd ` ring camp shall murmur out Demetrius .
</p>
<p>
CALI Must Greece , still wretched by her children 's folly , For ever mourn their avarice or factions ?
Demetrius justly pleads a double title ; The lover 's int ` rest aids the patriot 's claim .
</p>
<p>
LEONTIUS .
My pride shall ne'er protract my country 's woes ; Succeed , my friend , unenvied by Leontius .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
I feel new spirit shoot along my nerves ; My soul expands to meet approaching freedom .
Now hover o'er us , with propitious wings , Ye sacred shades of patriots and of martyrs !
All ye , whose blood tyrannick rage effus'd , Or persecution drank , attend our call ; I And from the mansions of perpetual peace Descend , to sweeten labours , once your own !
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Go then , and with united eloquence Confirm your troops ; and , when the moon 's fair beam Plays on the quiv ` ring waves , to guide our flight , Return , Demetrius , and be free for ever .

How the new monarch , swell'd with airy rule , Looks down , contemptuous , from his fancy'd height , And utters fate , unmindful of Abdalla !
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Far be such black ingratitude from Cali !
When Asia 's nations own me for their lord , Wealth , and command , and grandeur shall be thine !
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Is this the recompense reserv'd for me ?
Dar ` st thou thus dally with Abdalla 's passion ?
Henceforward , hope no more my slighted friendship ; Wake from thy dream of power to death and tortures , And bid thy visionary throne farewell .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Name , and enjoy thy wish --
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
I need not name it ; Aspasia 's lovers know but one desire , Nor hope , nor wish , nor live , but for Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
That fatal beauty , plighted to Demetrius , Heaven makes not mine to give .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Nor to deny .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Obtain her , and possess ; thou know ` st thy rival .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Too well I know him , since , on Thracia 's plains , I felt the force of his tempestuous arm , And saw my scatter'd squadrons fly before him .
Nor will I trust th ' uncertain chance of combat ; The rights of princes let the sword decide , The petty claims of empire and of honour : Revenge and subtle jealousy shall teach A surer passage to his hated heart .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Oh !
spare the gallant Greek , in him we lose The politician 's arts , and hero 's flame .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
When next we meet , before we storm the palace , The bowl shall circle to confirm our league ; Then shall these juices taint Demetrius ' draught , [ Showing a phial .
And stream , destructive , through his freezing veins : Thus shall he live to strike th ' important blow , And perish , ere he taste the joys of conquest .

CALI .
Blest prince , for whom indulgent heav'n ordains , At once , the joys of paradise and empire , Now join thy people 's and thy Cali 's prayers ; Suspend thy passage to the seats of bliss , Nor wish for houries in Irene 's arms .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Forbear -- I know the long-try'd faith of Cali .
</p>
<p>
CALI .
Oh !
could the eyes of kings , like those of heav ` n , Search to the dark recesses of the soul , Oft would they find ingratitude and treason , By smiles , and oaths , and praises , ill disguis'd .
How rarely would they meet , in crowded courts , Fidelity so firm , so pure , as mine .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Yet , ere we give our loosen'd thoughts to rapture , Let prudence obviate an impending danger : Tainted by sloth , the parent of sedition , The hungry janizary burns for plunder , And growls , in private , o'er his idle sabre .

<p>
MAHOMET .
To still their murmurs , ere the twentieth sun Shall shed his beams upon the bridal bed , I rouse to war , and conquer for Irene .
Then shall the Rhodian mourn his sinking tow ` rs , And Buda fall , and proud Vienna tremble ; Then shall Venetia feel the Turkish pow ` r , And subject seas roar round their queen in vain .

Then seize fair Italy 's delightful coast , To fix your standard in imperial Rome .

Her sons malicious clemency shall spare , To form new legends , sanctify new crimes ; To canonize the slaves of superstition , And fill the world with follies and impostures , Till angry heav'n shall mark them out for ruin , And war o'erwhelm them in their dream of vice .
O !
could her fabled saints and boasted prayers Call forth her ancient heroes to the field , How should I joy , midst the fierce shock of nations , To cross the tow ` rings of an equal soul , And bid the master-genius rule the world !

Mahomet , Solus .

<p>
Whome'er the hope , still blasted , still renew'd , Of happiness lures on from toil to toil , Remember Mahomet , and cease thy labour .
Behold him here , in love , in war , successful ; Behold him , wretched in his double triumph !
His fav ` rite faithless , and his mistress base .
Ambition only gave her to my arms , By reason not convinc'd , nor won by love .
Ambition was her crime ; but meaner folly Dooms me to loathe , at once , and dote on falsehood , And idolize th ' apostate I contemn .
If thou art more than the gay dream of fancy , More than a pleasing sound , without a meaning , O happiness !
sure thou art all Aspasia 's .

<p>
CARAZA .
Close , as we might unseen , we watch'd his steps : His hair disorder'd , and his gait unequal , Betray'd the wild emotions of his mind .
Sudden he stops , and inward turns his eyes , Absorb'd in thought ; then , starting from his trance , Constrains a sullen smile , and shoots away .
With him Abdalla we beheld --
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Abdalla !

<p>
MAHOMET .
He wears , of late , resentment on his brow , Deny'd the government of Servia 's province .

</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
How guilt , once harbour'd in the conscious breast , Intimidates the brave , degrades the great ; See Cali , dread of kings , and pride of armies , By treason levell'd with the dregs of men !
Ere guilty fear depress'd the hoary chief , An angry murmur , a rebellious frown , Had stretch'd the fiery boaster in the grave .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Shall monarchs fear to draw the sword of justice , Aw'd by the crowd , and by their slaves restrain'd ?

Shall then the Greeks , unpunish'd and conceal'd , Contrive , perhaps , the ruin of our empire ; League with our chiefs , and propagate sedition ?

Whate'er their scheme , the bassa 's death defeats it , And gratitude 's strong ties restrain my tongue .

CARAZA .
In that black day , when slaughter'd thousands fell Around these fatal walls , the tide of war Bore me victorious onward , where Demetrius Tore , unresisted , from the giant hand Of stern Sebalias , the triumphant crescent , And dash'd the might of Asam from the ramparts .
There I became , nor blush to make it known , The captive of his sword .
The coward Greeks , Enrag'd by wrongs , exulting with success , Doom'd me to die with all the Turkish captains ; But brave Demetrius scorn'd the mean revenge , And gave me life .

</p>
<p>
HASAN .
Do thou repay the gift , Lest unrewarded mercy lose its charms .
Profuse of wealth , or bounteous of success , When heav'n bestows the privilege to bless , Let no weak doubt the gen ` rous hand restrain ; For when was pow ' r beneficent in vain ?

ASPASIA , sola .
</p>
<p>
In these dark moments of suspended fate , While yet the future fortune of my country Lies in the womb of providence conceal'd , And anxious angels wait the mighty birth ; O !
grant thy sacred influence , pow ` rful virtue !
Attentive rise , survey the fair creation , Till , conscious of th ' encircling deity , Beyond the mists of care thy pinion tow ` rs .
This calm , these joys , dear innocence !
are thine : Joys ill exchang'd for gold , and pride , and empire .

</p>
<p>
IRENE .
See how the moon , through all th ' unclouded sky , Spreads her mild radiance , and descending dews Revive the languid flow ` rs ; thus nature shone New from the maker 's hand , and fair array'd In the bright colours of primeval spring ; When purity , while fraud was yet unknown , Play'd fearless in th ' inviolated shades .
This elemental joy , this gen ` ral calm , Is , sure , the smile of unoffended heav ` n. Yet !
why --
</p>
<p>
MAID .
Behold , within th ' embow ` ring grove Aspasia stands --
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
With melancholy mien , Pensive , and envious of Irene 's greatness .
Steal , unperceiv'd , upon her meditations But see , the lofty maid , at our approach , Resumes th ' imperious air of haughty virtue .
Are these th ' unceasing joys , th ' unmingled pleasures , [ To Aspasia .
For which Aspasia scorn'd the Turkish crown ?
Is this th ' unshaken confidence in heav ` n ?
Is this the boasted bliss of conscious virtue ?
When did content sigh out her cares in secret ?
When did felicity repine in deserts ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Ill suits with guilt the gaieties of triumph ; When daring vice insults eternal justice , The ministers of wrath forget compassion , And snatch the flaming bolt with hasty hand .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Forbear thy threats , proud prophetess of ill , Vers'd in the secret counsels of the sky .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Forbear !
-- But thou art sunk beneath reproach ; In vain affected raptures flush the cheek , And songs of pleasure warble from the tongue , When fear and anguish labour in the breast , And all within is darkness and confusion .
Thus , on deceitful Etna 's flow ` ry side , Unfading verdure glads the roving eye ; While secret flames , with unextinguish'd rage , Insatiate on her wasted entrails prey , And melt her treach ` rous beauties into ruin .

</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Is Greece deliver'd ?
is the tyrant fall ` n ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Greece is no more ; the prosp ` rous tyrant lives , Reserv'd for other lands , the scourge of heav ` n .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Say , by what fraud , what force , were you defeated ?
Betray'd by falsehood , or by crowds o'erborne ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
The pressing exigence forbids relation .
Abdalla --
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Hated name !
his jealous rage Broke out in perfidy -- Oh !

Hide me , oh hide me from upbraiding Greece ; Oh , hide me from myself !
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Be fruitless grief The doom of guilt alone , nor dare to seize The breast , where virtue guards the throne of peace .
Devolve , dear maid , thy sorrows on the wretch , Whose fear , or rage , or treachery , betray'd us !
</p>

IRENE .

[ Withdraws
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Yet tell .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
To tell or hear were waste of life .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
The life , which only this design supported , Were now well lost in hearing how you fail'd .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Or meanly fraudulent or madly gay , Abdalla , while we waited near the palace , With ill tim'd mirth propos'd the bowl of love .
Just as it reach'd my lips , a sudden cry Urg'd me to dash it to the ground , untouch'd , And seize my sword with disencumber'd hand .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
What cry ?
The stratagem ?
Did then Abdalla --
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
At once a thousand passions fir'd his cheek !
Then all is past , he cry'd -- and darted from us ; Nor , at the call of Cali , deign'd to turn .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Why did you stay , deserted and betray'd ?
What more could force attempt , or art contrive ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Amazement seiz'd us , and the hoary bassa Stood , torpid in suspense ; but soon Abdalla Return'd with force that made resistance vain , And bade his new confed ` rates seize the traitors .
Cali , disarm'd , was borne away to death ; Myself escap'd , or favour'd , or neglected .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Oh Greece !
renown'd for science and for wealth , Behold thy boasted honours snatch'd away .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Though disappointment blast our general scheme , Yet much remains to hope .
I shall not call The day disastrous , that secures our flight ; Nor think that effort lost , which rescues thee .

</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
At length , the prize is mine -- The haughty maid , That bears the fate of empires in her air , Henceforth shall live for me ; for me alone Shall plume her charms , and , with attentive watch , Steal from Abdalla 's eye the sign to smile .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Cease this wild roar of savage exultation ; Advance , and perish in the frantick boast .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Forbear , Demetrius , 't is Aspasia calls thee ; Thy love , Aspasia , calls ; restrain thy sword ; Nor rush on useless wounds , with idle courage .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
What now remains ?
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
It now remains to fly !
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Shall , then , the savage live , to boast his insult ; Tell , how Demetrius shunn'd his single hand , And stole his life and mistress from his sabre ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Infatuate loiterer , has fate , in vain , Unclasp'd his iron gripe to set thee free ?
Still dost thou flutter in the jaws of death ; Snar'd with thy fears , and maz'd in stupefaction ?
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Forgive , my fair ; 't is life , 't is nature calls : Now , traitor , feel the fear that chills my hand .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
'T is madness to provoke superfluous danger , And cowardice to dread the boast of folly .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Fly , wretch , while yet my pity grants thee flight ; The pow ' r of Turkey waits upon my call .
Leave but this maid , resign a hopeless claim , And drag away thy life , in scorn and safety , Thy life , too mean a prey to lure Abdalla .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Once more I dare thy sword ; behold the prize , Behold , I quit her to the chance of battle .
[ Quitting Aspasia .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Well may ` st thou call thy master to the combat , And try the hazard , that hast nought to stake ; Alike my death or thine is gain to thee ; But soon thou shalt repent : another moment Shall throw th ' attending janizaries round thee .

<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Behold a boaster 's worth !
Now snatch , my fair , The happy moment ; hasten to the shore , Ere he return with thousands at his side .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
In vain I listen to th ' inviting call Of freedom and of love ; my trembling joints , Relax'd with fear , refuse to bear me forward .
Depart , Demetrius , lest my fate involve thee ; Forsake a wretch abandon'd to despair , To share the miseries herself has caus'd .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Let us not struggle with th ' eternal will , Nor languish o'er irreparable ruins ; Come , haste and live -- Thy innocence and truth Shall bless our wand ` rings , and propitiate heav ` n .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Press not her flight , while yet her feeble nerves Refuse their office , and uncertain life Still labours with imaginary woe ; Here let me tend her with officious care , Watch each unquiet flutter of the breast , And joy to feel the vital warmth return , To see the cloud forsake her kindling cheek , And hail the rosy dawn of rising health .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Oh !
rather , scornful of flagitious greatness , Resolve to share our dangers and our toils , Companion of our flight , illustrious exile , Leave slav ` ry , guilt , and infamy behind .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
My soul attends thy voice , and banish'd virtue Strives to regain her empire of the mind : Assist her efforts with thy strong persuasion ; Sure , 't is the happy hour ordain'd above , When vanquish'd vice shall tyrannise no more .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
Remember , peace and anguish are before thee , And honour and reproach , and heav'n and hell .
</p>
<p>
ASPASIA .
Content with freedom , and precarious greatness .

Now make thy choice , while yet the pow ' r of choice Kind heav'n affords thee , and inviting mercy Holds out her hand to lead thee back to truth .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Stay -- in this dubious twilight of conviction , The gleams of reason , and the clouds of passion , Irradiate and obscure my breast , by turns : Stay but a moment , and prevailing truth Will spread resistless light upon my soul .
</p>
<p>
DEMETRIUS .
But , since none knows the danger of a moment , And heav'n forbids to lavish life away , Let kind compulsion terminate the contest .
[ Seizing her hand .
Ye christian captives , follow me to freedom : A galley waits us , and the winds invite .

[ IRENE walks at a distance from her attendants . ]

After a pause .
Against the head , which innocence secures , Insidious malice aims her darts in vain , Turn'd backwards by the pow ` rful breath of heav ` n. Perhaps , e ` en now the lovers , unpursu'd , Bound o'er the sparkling waves .
Go , happy bark , Thy sacred freight shall still the raging main .
To guide thy passage shall th ' aerial spirits Fill all the starry lamps with double blaze ; Th ' applauding sky shall pour forth all its beams , To grace the triumph of victorious virtue ; While I , not yet familiar to my crimes , Recoil from thought , and shudder at myself .
How am I chang'd !
How lately did Irene Fly from the busy pleasures of her sex , Well pleas'd to search the treasures of remembrance , And live her guiltless moments o'er anew !
Come , let us seek new pleasures in the palace , [ To her attendants , going off .

Ask of thy heart ; attend the voice of conscience -- Who charges guilt !

<p>
IRENE .
Whate'er thy accusation , The sultan is my judge .
</p>
<p>

This day has prov'd my fondness for the sultan ; He knew Irene 's truth .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
The sultan knows it ; He knows , how near apostasy to treason -- But 't is not mine to judge -- I scorn and leave thee .

</p>
<p>
IRENE .
What wild mistake is this !
Take hence , with speed , Your robe of mourning , and your dogs of death .
Quick from my sight , you inauspicious monsters ; Nor dare , henceforth , to shock Irene 's walks .
</p>
<p>
HASAN .
Alas !
they come commanded by the sultan , Th ' unpitying ministers of Turkish justice , Nor dare to spare the life his frown condemns .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Are these the rapid thunderbolts of war , That pour with sudden violence on kingdoms , And spread their flames , resistless , o'er the world ?
What sleepy charms benumb these active heroes , Depress their spirits , and retard their speed ?
Beyond the fear of ling ` ring punishment , Aspasia now , within her lover 's arms , Securely sleeps , and , in delightful dreams , Smiles at the threat ` nings of defeated rage .
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
We come , bright virgin , though relenting nature Shrinks at the hated task , for thy destruction .
When summon'd by the sultan 's clam ` rous fury , We ask'd , with tim ` rous tongue , th ' offender 's name , He struck his tortur'd breast , and roar'd , Irene !
We started at the sound , again inquir'd ; Again his thund ` ring voice return'd , Irene !
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Whence is this rage ; what barb ` rous tongue has wrong'd me ?
What fraud misleads him ?
or what crimes incense ?

'T is ours , alas !
to punish , not to judge , Not call'd to try the cause , we heard the sentence , Ordain'd the mournful messengers of death .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
Some ill designing statesman 's base intrigue !
Some cruel stratagem of jealous beauty !
Perhaps , yourselves the villains that defame me : -- Now haste to murder , ere returning thought Recall th ' extorted doom .
-- It must be so : Confess your crime , or lead me to the sultan ; There dauntless truth shall blast the vile accuser ; Then shall you feel , what language can not utter , Each piercing torture , ev'ry change of pain , That vengeance can invent , or pow ' r inflict .

<p>
CARAZA .
Unhappy fair !
compassion calls upon me To check this torrent of imperious rage : While unavailing anger crowds thy tongue With idle threats and fruitless exclamation , The fraudful moments ply their silent wings , And steal thy life away .
Death 's horrid angel Already shakes his bloody sabre o'er thee .
The raging sultan burns , till our return , Curses the dull delays of ling ` ring mercy , And thinks his fatal mandates ill obey'd .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Is then your sov ` reign 's life so cheaply rated , That thus you parley with detected treason ?
Should she prevail to gain the sultan 's presence , Soon might her tears engage a lover 's credit ; Perhaps , her malice might transfer the charge ; Perhaps , her pois ` nous tongue might blast Abdalla .
</p>
<p>
IRENE .
O !
let me but be heard , nor fear from me Or flights of pow ` r , or projects of ambition .
My hopes , my wishes , terminate in life , A little life , for grief , and for repentance .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
I mark'd her wily messenger afar , And saw him sculking in the closest walks : I guess'd her dark designs , and warn'd the sultan , And bring her former sentence new-confirmed .
</p>
<p>
HASAN .
Then call it not our cruelty , nor crime ; Deem us not deaf to woe , nor blind to beauty , That , thus constrain'd , we speed the stroke of death .
[ Beckons the mutes .

<p>
IRENE .
O , name not death !
Distraction and amazement , Horrour and agony are in that sound !
Let me but live , heap woes on woes upon me ; Hide me with murd ` rers in the dungeon 's gloom ; Send me to wander on some pathless shore , Let shame and hooting infamy pursue me , Let slav ` ry harass , and let hunger gripe .
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
Could we reverse the sentence of the sultan , Our bleeding bosoms plead Irene 's cause .
But cries and tears are vain ; prepare , with patience , To meet that fate , we can delay no longer .
[ The mutes , at the sign , lay hold of her .
</p>
<p>

O !
grant me but a moment , And bounteous heav'n repay the mighty mercy , With peaceful death , and happiness eternal .

Guilt and despair , pale spectres !

Does not thy bosom ( for I know thee tender , A stranger to th ' oppressor 's savage joy , ) Melt at Irene 's fate , and share her woes ?
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
Her piercing cries yet fill the loaded air , Dwell on my ear , and sadden all my soul .
But let us try to clear our clouded brows , And tell the horrid tale with cheerful face ; The stormy sultan rages at our stay .
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Frame your report with circumspective art : Inflame her crimes , exalt your own obedience ; But let no thoughtless hint involve Abdalla .
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
What need of caution to report the fate Of her , the sultan 's voice condemn'd to die ?
Or why should he , whose violence of duty Has serv'd his prince so well , demand our silence ?
</p>
<p>
ABDALLA .
Perhaps , my zeal , too fierce , betray'd my prudence ; Perhaps , my warmth exceeded my commission ; Perhaps -- I will not stoop to plead my cause , Or argue with the slave that sav'd Demetrius .

HASAN .
Thine orders , mighty sultan , are perform'd , And all Irene now is breathless clay .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Your hasty zeal defrauds the claim of justice , And disappointed vengeance burns in vain .
I came to heighten tortures by reproach , And add new terrours to the face of death .
Was this the maid , whose love I bought with empire ?
True , she was fair ; the smile of innocence Play'd on her cheek -- So shone the first apostate -- Irene 's chamber !
Did not roaring Cali , Just as the rack forc'd out his struggling soul , Name for the scene of death , Irene 's chamber ?
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
His breath prolong'd , but to detect her treason , Then , in short sighs , forsook his broken frame .

MAHOMET .
Who ?
the dead Irene ?
Was she then guiltless !
Has my thoughtless rage Destroy'd the fairest workmanship of heav ` n !
Doom'd her to death , unpity'd and unheard , Amidst her kind solicitudes for me !
Ye slaves of cruelty , ye tools of rage , [ To Hasan and Caraza .
Ye blind , officious ministers of folly , Could not her charms repress your zeal for murder ?
Could not her pray ` rs , her innocence , her tears , Suspend the dreadful sentence for an hour ?
One hour had freed me from the fatal errour !
One hour had say'd me from despair and madness .
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
Your fierce impatience forc'd us from your presence , Urg'd us to speed , and bade us banish pity , Nor trust our passions with her fatal charms .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
What hadst thou lost , by slighting those commands ?
Thy life , perhaps -- Were but Irene spar'd , Well , if a thousand lives like thine had perish'd ; Such beauty , sweetness , love , were cheaply bought With half the grov ` ling slaves that load the globe .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
Great is thy woe !
But think , illustrious sultan , Such ills are sent for souls , like thine , to conquer .
Shake off this weight of unavailing grief , Rush to the war , display thy dreadful banners , And lead thy troops , victorious , round the world .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Robb'd of the maid , with whom I wish'd to triumph , No more I burn for fame , or for dominion ; Success and conquest now are empty sounds , Remorse and anguish seize on all my breast ; Those groves , whose shades embower'd the dear Irene , Heard her last cries , and fann'd her dying beauties , Shall hide me from the tasteless world for ever .
[ Mahomet goes back , and returns .
Yet , ere I quit the sceptre of dominion , Let one just act conclude the hateful day -- Hew down , ye guards , those vassals of destruction , [ Pointing to Hasan and Caraza .
Those hounds of blood , that catch the hint to kill , Bear off , with eager haste , th ' unfinished sentence , And speed the stroke , lest mercy should o'ertake them .

CARAZA .
Hear but a moment .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Hadst thou heard a moment , Thou might ` st have liv'd , for thou hadst spar'd Irene .
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
I heard her , pitied her , and wish'd to save her .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
And wish'd -- be still thy fate to wish in vain .
</p>
<p>
CARAZA .
I heard , and soften'd , till Abdalla brought Her final doom , and hurried her destruction .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
Abdalla brought her doom !
Abdalla brought it !
The wretch , whose guilt , declar'd by tortur'd Cali , My rage and grief had hid from my remembrance : Abdalla brought her doom !
</p>
<p>
HASAN .
Abdalla brought it , While yet she begg'd to plead her cause before thee .
</p>
<p>
MAHOMET .
O , seize me , madness -- Did she call on me !
I feel , I see the ruffian 's barb ` rous rage .
He seiz'd her melting in the fond appeal , And stopp'd the heav ` nly voice that call'd on me .
My spirits fail ; awhile support me , vengeance -- Be just , ye slaves ; and , to be just , be cruel ; Contrive new racks , imbitter ev'ry pang , Inflict whatever treason can deserve , Which murder'd innocence that call'd on me .
[ Exit Mahomet ; Abdalla is dragged off .

SCENE XIII .
</p>
<p>
HASAN , CARAZA , MUSTAPHA , MURZA .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA to MURZA .
What plagues , what tortures , are in store for thee , Thou sluggish idler , dilatory slave !
Behold the model of consummate beauty , Torn from the mourning earth by thy neglect .
</p>
<p>
MURZA .
Such was the will of heav ` n -- A band of Greeks , That mark'd my course , suspicious of my purpose , Rush'd out and seiz'd me , thoughtless and unarm'd , Breathless , amaz'd , and on the guarded beach Detain'd me , till Demetrius set me free .
</p>
<p>
MUSTAPHA .
So sure the fall of greatness , rais'd on crimes !
So fix'd the justice of all conscious heav ` n !
When haughty guilt exults with impious joy , Mistake shall blast , or accident destroy ; Weak man , with erring rage , may throw the dart , But heav'n shall guide it to the guilty heart .
</p>
<p>
EPILOGUE .
</p>
<p>
BY SIR WILLIAM YONGE .
</p>
<p>
Marry a Turk !
a haughty , tyrant king !
Who thinks us women born to dress and sing To please his fancy !
see no other man !
Let him persuade me to it -- if he can ; Besides , he has fifty wives ; and who can bear To have the fiftieth part , her paltry share ?
</p>
<p>
'T is true , the fellow 's handsome , straight , and tall , But how the devil should he please us all !
My swain is little -- true -- but , be it known , My pride 's to have that little all my own .
Men will be ever to their errours blind , Where woman 's not allow'd to speak her mind .
I swear this eastern pageantry is nonsense , And for one man -- one wife 's enough in conscience .
</p>
<p>
In vain proud man usurps what 's woman 's due ; For us , alone , they honour 's paths pursue : Inspir'd by us , they glory 's heights ascend ; Woman the source , the object , and the end .
Though wealth , and pow ` r , and glory , they receive , These are all trifles to what we can give .
For us the statesman labours , hero fights , Bears toilsome days , and wakes long tedious nights ; And , when blest peace has silenc'd war 's alarms ; Receives his full reward in beauty 's arms .
