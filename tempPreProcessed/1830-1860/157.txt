Act I Scene 1 [ Apartment at an inn at Versailles .
Enter Waiter shewing in Major de Burgh , L. ] Wai .
This way , Major .
This way , sir !
De B .
A strange gentleman - a fellow-countryman , enquiring for me , you say ?
Have you no conjecture of his name ?
Wai .
None , Major  never set eyes on him before !
he arrived only this morning at Versailles , after traveling in double quick time - with deference to your honourable cloth - from Vienna .
De B. From Vienna ?
[ Enter Arundel , R. ] Aru .
De Burgh !
my dear fellow !
[ Shakes hands . ]
De B. Ha !
Arundel !
Aru .
[ Stopping his mouth . ]
Hush !
[ He signs to the Waiter to quit the room .
Waiter exits L. ] De B .
A thousand welcomes .
[ Shakes his hand . ]
No mysteries  but honestly tell me what brings you to Versailles - a woman , or a place ?
Aru .
Both !
you may remember that , while still at college , I was contracted in marriage to my cousin , Helena Dillon .
De B. Daughter to the staunch old General , who commands our Irish Brigade ?
Aru .
Exactly .
We had never met !
Helena was sewing a sampler at a convent in Paris , while you and I ran riot at the Military College of Vienna .
De B. Whence the rumour of your wild exploits excited the vehement indignation of the General .
Aru .
Ah !
at that unlucky moment he married again  and the new Countess Dillon soon persuaded him to break off his engagements with me .
De B. Persuaded !
Aru .
For the advancement of her family interests , she united her step-daughter to the Marquis de Clermont , an infirm libertine , who , on the occasion of his marriage , was sent ambassador to the Court of Vienna .
De B. [ Significantly . ]
In order that his pretty bride might become acquainted with her wild cousin !
Eh , my dear Arundel ?
Aru .
[ Embarrassed . ]
Why , considering the relationship between us , it was but natural I should form a sort of humdrum-cousinly acquaintance with De Clermont 's wife .
De B. Or that you should travel post to Versailles to improve it with his widow !
Never deny it , man !
'T is no sin to love a young and handsome widow , though she be one 's cousin !
Since his Excellency 's death , Madame De Clermont has thrown aside her weeds , and appeared again at Court .
The whole world is at her feet !
Aru .
The devil it is .
3 De B. From His Majesty down to the smallest page in waiting  all bow the knee to the lovely Marchioness !
Aru .
[ Agitated . ]
No doubt !
't is mighty well !
The King , too !
[ Walks about . ]
De B. Louis himself - nay , even the all-conquering Richelieu is her slave .
Aru .
The profligate Richelieu !
Oh , woman !
woman !
De B. Further , 't is whispered that , aided by the intrigues of Countess Dillon , she is about to obtain an appointment in the Queen 's household !
Aru .
A place at Court ?
Never !
Of the designs of the King , rumours had already reached me  I had hoped to have found them groundless , but they are too palpable !
I will not hear of this place for her  I will die rather than consent to her accepting it .
De B. Your humdrum-cousinly acquaintance , appears to endow you with great authority ?
hem !
Aru .
Paha !
absurd !
[ Walks again . ]
She at Court !
De B .
You take the matter deucedly to heart .
Aru .
[ Stopping short . ]
To be frank , then , I do !
I am pledged , heart and hand , to my lovely cousin  but that Machiavel in petticoats , Countess Dillon , has already plotted another marriage for her !
And my uncle , who so peremptorily broke off our early betrothment , is not likely to favor my pretensions now , as , unhappily , I am still a stranger to him .
De B. And he is still so irritated against you , that were you to present yourself as a suitor to his daughter , he would dismiss you the house with as little ceremony as one of his own orderlies .
Aru .
For which reason , my dear fellow , I depend on you to introduce me as a candidate for the first vacant commission in his regiment .
Call me Fitzgerald .
Say I 'm a fellow-Conaught man .
Tell him - De B .
The imposture would still be useless  you are known to an officer who has lately joined our regiment .
Do you remember , at the Military College , a little fellow named Phaidrig O'Neil ?
Aru .
A right-hearted , wrong-headed Irishman !
as brave as his sword - who insists that he is linearly descended from the kings of Ulster - who never got a glass over his usual stint but he became every inch a king , and exercised his prerogative right royally .
De B .
The same !
A sabre cut on his head at the siege of Phillipsburg has not cooled either his courage or his pride .
And now , whenever an extra glass of Burgundy inflames his blood , our friend actually proclaims himself king .
Ha !
ha !
Aru .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Poor O'Neil !
Does he never get into mischief , when in these royal moods ?
De B. Why , his companions and brother-officers , who love him for his gaiety and his gallantry , in moments of frolic and wine usually keep a sharp eye upon him , whilst they humour his absurdity by doing all due homage to `` King O'Neil '' - till the fumes of the debauch leave his brain , when he lets his royal mantle slip quietly from his shoulders , and gracefully falls back on his troop in the Brigade .
Aru .
So cracked-brained an accomplice , I admit , would be the ruin of my plot .
De B .
But he will certainly recognize you !
4 Aru .
In that case I must trust to my own impudence , and protest I never beheld him in all my life : - unless campaigning has changed his character , he 's simple as a child .
De B .
He conserves his native simplicity unimpaired , but when sober is too sagacious to be duped easily .
[ Enter Waiter , L. ] Wai .
Captain O'Neil is below , sir .
O ` N. [ Heard without , L. ] What 's the Major 's billet ?
De B. By Jove , here he is !
I could swear to his brogue at half a league 's distance .
Show the Captain in .
[ Exit Servant , L. ] Aru .
Now to forswear my college chum , and halfcracked countryman , with the coolest possible countenance .
[ Enter O'Neil , with letters , L. ] O ` N. Beg pardon , my dear fellow , your ba ` tman at the barracks told me he did n't know which way you were gone , so I followed ye , till I met ye en face .
Orders !
[ Gives papers . ]
De B. Thank you , O'Neil , thank you !
Orders from the general ?
[ Reads , retiring up C. ] O ` N. [ Aside , eyeing Arundel . ]
Why the devil did n't he introduce me to his friend I wonder ?
Sir !
your most obedient !
[ Crosses from I. to R , when Arundel turns and bows stiffly , R. ] Aru .
Sir , your humble servant .
O ` N. [ Startled . ]
Eh !
blessed St. Patrick !
It is  but yet it ca n't be though - but it is !
I - sir - Arundle , my dear fellow !
[ Tries to take his hand . ]
Aru .
Sir !
I have not exactly the honour of - O ` N. [ Interrupting . ]
Och !
then - I ask yer pardon , sir  the fact is , I took you for a scapegrace of a countryman of mine , and a schoolfellow , one Sir Henry Arundel  but , of course , you know best , whether or no you 're yourself or somebody else  but , by my honour , you 're as like my friend ould Harry , as Arundel is himself  but he was always up to his ears in waggery and wickedness , so I christened him ould Harry .
Eh , do n't you remember ?
You 're not ould Harry , are you ?
Aru .
Sir , I - De B. [ Ceremoniously , C. ] This , my dear O'Neil , is my friend , Mr. Fitzgerald - Fitzgerald , my friend , Captain O'Neil .
O ` N .
At your service , my honey !
Fitzgerald !
De B .
A candidate for the first commission vacant in the regiment , O'Neil , and a fine fellow !
O ` N. [ Crosses to center . ]
He does us honour .
[ Shakes hands . ]
I trust we shall be better acquainted .
But you must know our Roster 's full just now , so that if you think to get easily in , you 'll be plaguily out , Mr. Fitzgibbon .
Aru .
and De B. [ Together . ]
Fitzpatrick , sir !
Fitzgerald , O'Neil .
De B .
You perceive there 's a difference .
O ` N. I do , and a distinction !
Only settle what I am to call your friend , Major .
Is it to be Fitzgerald or Fitzpatrick ?
Aru .
I am called Sir Fitzpatrick Fitzgerald .
You 've no objection to the names I hope ?
5 O ` N. None in life  only a couple of Fitz at a time might bother any man - no offense I hope to Mr. Fitzgerald Fitzpatrick .
Aru .
No offense if none be intended , Captain O'Neil .
O ` N. Harry Arundel 's voice all the world over !
Major , only look at the man 's voice !
Am I in my right senses ?
[ To De B. ] Are you in yours ?
[ Pointing to Arundel . ]
Is he in his ?
Or maybe this is one of ould Ovid 's metamorphoses .
De B. [ Aside . ]
If you persist , he will grow angry .
O ` N. Do you think there 's a chance of that  I 'd like to see how he looks when angry .
De B. Hush !
these orders , my dear O'Neil , acquaint me that we are to escort the King tomorrow to Court .
O ` N .
The devil we are !
Then I shall see the French King !
This is the first chance I 've had of beholding his Majesty 's gracious features since I joined the Brigade .
[ To Arundel . ]
You , I suppose , have seen the face of King Louis , Mr. Fitz - Fitz - excuse the observation .
Aru .
Oh yes  I have seen his face very often !
That is , upon a louis d'or .
O ` N. Often upon a louis d'or - you 're a lucky lad !
Aru .
Why , Captain , you receive his pay , and ought to look gratefully on his golden portraits .
O ` N. That 's true  but I 'm sorry to say my familiarity with the golden pictures of the King would not enable me to recognize the royal original .
Our pay 's not regular enough - eh , Major ?
De B. Prudence , Major !
remember , we are now in the limits of the royal Court , and must be delicate on the subject of our claims here .
O ` N. Oh , manners !
I know it would be the height of indelicacy to ask for your own at Court  but if I had a hold of the royal ear , I 'd - De B. Pray be silent , Captain , and have patience .
O ` N. Oh , mum !
I 'll be as patient as a pig under a grate , and as silent , if that 's manners !
De B. I must now lose no time in presenting Fitzgerald to the General .
Let us leave him to dress .
O ` N. [ Slaps Arundel on shoulder . ]
To be sure .
Full fig .
Mr. Fitz - De B. [ Endeavours to walk him to the door . ]
Good bye , then , for the present  remember that Fitzgerald dines with us at our barrack to-night .
O ` N. Bravo !
We 'll give him the `` Cead Mille faltha , '' for the honour of the corps .
De B. Go and give orders then .
O ` N. I 'll do that thing with all the veins of my heart !
And , I say , Major , we 'll make a Christian of this lad .
I 'll be his godmother !
Och , wo n't we make a night of it - and , maybe , a next day on it .
[ Exit L. ] Aru .
Success !
De Burgh !
Success !
O'Neil is all abroad !
Ha !
ha !
ha !
De B. Success beyond my hopes  and now to your toilet : the hour of the King 's levee approaches , we must lose no time with the General .
6 Aru .
Allons !
you shall equip me with the last swordknow , · la Richelieu !
and my first bold stroke shall be to rival myself , as our friend O'Neil would say , in the smiles of my sweet cousin Helena .
[ Exeunt R. ] Scene 2 [ A saloon richly furnished .
Count Dillon discovered writing , Orderly Officer waiting .
In front , Countess Dillon knitting . ]
Dil .
[ To Orderly . ]
This to Captain Jerningham .
This , to Quarter-master O'Grady .
[ Exit Orderly C. ] Cou .
Are you at leisure now to listen to me ?
Dil .
Not on the old chapter , madam  I must decline all further interference with the destinies of my daughter .
'T was at your suggestion I broke off her match with my nephew Harry , and united her to one who lived to make her wretched , and who died to leave her penniless .
Cou .
You talk , my dear General , as if the widow of one of our first nobles , were likely to be reduced to a workhouse .
Dil .
And so she might , had not her father 's home and heart been open to receive her !
Cou .
A word from you to the King would secure her a pension , and a place at Court .
Dil .
How often must I repeat to you , that 't is not in my nature to go cringing and begging to his Majesty .
It is not for an Irish gentleman , madam , to become a hanger-on in the antechambers of courts , hungering after ribbons and pensions , and soliciting for this grace , and for that favor .
Cou .
Yet , your daughter 's interests !
Consider your daughter 's interests .
Dil .
Never fear !
young and handsome as she is , Helena will marry again .
Cou .
She never will !
Dil .
And why not ?
Cou .
She wants the better half of widowhood - a jointure .
My kinsman , the Duke of Richelieu , indeed , is a disinterested suitor  but the Marchioness has made up her mind to a second marriage .
Dil .
Who says so ?
Cou .
Herself !
Ask her !
Apropos - here comes your daughter .
[ Enter Marchioness , L. ] Mar. .
Good morning , Countess .
[ Crosses to C. ] Good morning , my dear father !
Dil .
[ Kisses her forehead . ]
The Countess tells me , Helena , that you have decided against marrying again .
Mar. .
Yes , papa !
Dil.Your first marriage has prejudiced you against matrimony .
Mar. [ C. ] Yes , papa !
Dil .
Should , then , any noble of the Court tender proposals , I may , in short , decline his overtures .
Mar. .
Without a moment 's hesitation .
Dil .
Reflect - as a widow , you must remain obscure , neglected , poor - 7 Mar. [ Caressing him . ]
Dare you to say so - when you have once more received me into your arms  once more installed me as your daughter .
Dil .
These grey hairs , Helena , should remind you that your father is mortal .
Mar. .
Why remind me of that which it is my happiness to forget ?
Cou .
[ Aside . ]
A little crocodile !
Dil .
The sword of my ancestors constitutes my fortune .
When I am gone , my child , you will be friendless .
The Countess Dillon informs me that the Duke de Richelieu aspires to your hand .
Mar. .
Richelieu !
who made his first wife miserable , whose hotel is besieged by creditors , and whose dissipation and profligacy have made his name a proverb .
Suffer me , my dear father , to remain in retirement !
to live under your protection !
I have here a thousand avocations that will render me useful - to read to you - to write for you - to ride - to walk with you when you are well and cheerful .
And when the gout comes to render your winter evenings tedious , I will then nurse you , like a petted child , into your wonted good humour .
Let me remain with you , my dear father , if you love your Helena .
Dil .
[ Affected . ]
A gypsy !
Bless her !
[ Goes up R. ] Cou .
[ Aside . ]
Artful little hypocrite !
[ Aloud . ]
Are you quite sure , my dear Marchioness , that this passion for domestic life is not twin-brother to a tenderer passion ?
[ Servant enters C. , whispers to Dillon , and then goes off C. ] Mar. .
You have no grounds , Madam , for the supposition .
Cou .
Nor you , perhaps , a favored lover at Vienna .
Mar. .
Heavens !
Dil .
Ladies , I have a visitor coming up , who will amuse you .
Captain O'Neil , just arrived here from Phillipsburg , where he led the `` Forlorn Hope , '' and greatly distinguished himself .
[ Servant enters , ushering O'Neil , C. ] Ser .
Captain Patrick O'Neil !
O ` N. Phadrig , my dear .
Phadrig is the true classical pronunciation !
General , your humble servant !
Dil .
Captain - `` Caed Mille faltha ! ''
- I 'm glad to take you by the hand : Helena , child , let me present you to a countryman , a most loyal subject of King James , and one of the bravest soldiers in the pay of King Louis .
O ` N. My modesty , General !
consider my modesty !
Dil .
Captain Phadrig O'Neil , Countess - a lineal descendant of the old Kings of Ulster - eh , Captain ?
O ` N .
The poorest soldier in King James 's guards , and your servant always to the death .
Cou .
Are you , too , an Irishman , Captain ?
O ` N. I am , madam , every inch of me , though by accident a native of France  owing to my mother being away from home at the time of my birth .
Mar. .
But how came you by so pure an accent , Captain ?
O ` N. By inheritance , my lady !
His brogue and his sword were all my father brought with him from Ireland  these he bequeathed to me , and I hope to carry to the grave my sword and my brogue , as8 pure and untarnished as I received them , both the one and the other !
Dil .
Well said , Captain  and that you will do so , I will be your guarantee .
[ Servant enters L. ] Ser .
Major De Burgh and Mr. Fitzgerald .
Dil .
I 'll wait on them  but who is Mr. Fitzgerald ?
Do you know the gentleman , Captain ?
O ` N. Why , I thought I did  that is , I mistook him for somebody else , but he insists upon it he 's himself , and I presume he knows best .
Cou .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
what an amusing creature .
O ` N. Mighty diverting , is n't it , madam ?
I can tell you 't is himself , General : he comes to take service , and is as hopeful looking a recruit as ever shouldered a half-pike .
Cou .
Shall we retire , Count ?
Dil .
Oh , by no means  I desire to present De Burgh , who commands the regiment just arrived here .
No time like the present .
I regard my officers as a part of my family , since I feel they regard me as a father .
[ Exit L. ] O ` N .
That I 'll answer for , ladies !
and I only wish , madam , you could see the whole of your family under arms , horse and foot - by my soul you might feel proud of your children - for you 'd see ten thousand of the tightest boys ever manufactured in Ireland , and that 's saying a good deal for them .
Mar. .
Pity such faithful services should be lost to our country , Captain O'Neil .
O ` N. Not exactly lost , madam , since we will bequeath to our country the example of loyalty and fidelity to her sovereign , an example which I trust our latest posterity will ever be proud to recollect , and always be prompt to imitate .
[ Enter O'Dillon , De Burgh , and Arundel , L. ] Dil .
Ladies , I have the honour to present to your favour , my gallant friend Major de Burgh , and Mr. Fitzgerald .
Mar. .
Harry here !
Heavens !
What audacity !
What imprudence !
Dil .
[ To Arundel . ]
You have lately arrived from England ?
Aru .
[ L. ] I - I reached Versailles only this morning .
Dil .
[ L. C. , to De Burgh . ]
Has he been educated for the service ?
De B .
He has , General .
Dil .
And where , pray ?
Aru .
At the Military College of Vienna .
O ` N .
The devil you were !
Dil .
You must be about the same standing , Captain O'Neil .
O ` N. Within half an inch , General .
Dil .
Pooh !
pooh !
I mean at college , Captain .
O ` N .
As near as buds of the same sprig , General !
Dil .
You were acquainted , I presume , sir , with my wild , graceless nephew , Sir Harry Arundel !
9 O ` N. I knew him well , General .
I was on excellent terms with him , and the fun of the thing was , that when I met Mr. Fitzgerald here this morning , I thought - De B .
You thought you discovered an old schoolfellow , O'Neil !
Be silent !
[ Aside . ]
O ` N. Why , this is no treason !
[ Turns up L. ] Dil .
[ Takes De Burgh up the stage . ]
But allow me , Major , to ask you a question .
[ Retires up L. Arundel and the Marchioness gradually approach each other , the Countess watching them . ]
Mar. [ Aside to him . ]
Harry !
What madness has brought you hither ?
Aru .
Let your own heart suggest the answer : once more to look upon your face .
Mar. [ Aside to him . ]
And be once more rejected by my father !
Aru .
No !
Give me but time to - Mar. .
Hush !
the Countess is observant .
[ They approach the rest . ]
De B. [ Conversing with Dillon . ]
I fancy , General , these rumours belie poor Arundel !
They tell me that he has formed an honourable attachment - the best proof of amendment .
Dil .
On the contrary !
I learn from the Countess that my nephew still frequents the most dissipated society .
O ` N .
He was a little loose in his company , now and then , I remember .
Aru .
How , sir ?
Dil .
What , he was wild , eh , Captain ?
O ` N .
As a three-year old colt !
and is yet , I 'll answer for him !
Dil .
Aye - wilful and headstrong !
O ` N. Wilful as a woman , and headstrong as a buffalo !
Aru .
[ Aside . ]
Devil take this fellow !
De B. Ha !
ha !
ha !
Be quiet .
But a true fellow in the main , eh , O'Neil ?
O ` N. Oh , true as steel from poin to hilt , with the kindest spirit and the softest heart of any boy in the college , or out of it !
Mar. .
Your picture is , I fear , a flattering one , Captain  but thank you , for my cousin .
[ Servant enters , and announces , `` The Duke de Richelieu , '' and exits , C. ] Aru .
[ Aside . ]
Ha !
Richelieu here !
Dil .
Attend the Duke !
Gentlemen , you will excuse me .
I have to attend the levee of the King .
De B. General , we 'll take our leave .
Come away , man : do n't you see we are dismissed .
Ladies , your most obedient .
Dil .
Rely on my good services , Mr. Fitzgerald .
Your desire shall be laid before King James this day .
[ They exit , C. ] Captain O'Neil , I am glad to welcome you once more to Versailles .
O ` N. I desire no better , General !
Ladies , yours10 devotedly to the death , and a day further if I can serve you !
[ Exeunt O'Neil , De Burgh , and Arundel , C. ] Cou .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
what a strange creature !
Dil .
Poor O'Neil !
with the simplicity of a child , and the heart of a Bayard !
What say you to our King of Ulster , Helena , eh ?
Mar. .
Oh !
his Irish Majesty has quite won my heart !
Cou .
[ Aside . ]
What , by his eulogy on Arundel , child ?
[ Enter Servant , ushering the Duke de Richelieu .
The Duke enters , C. ] Ric .
[ Bows and crosses to Marchioness . ]
You deigned not , madam , last night , to grace the circle of the Queen .
Mar. .
Among so many attractions , was my absence noticed ?
Ric .
'T was attested by their very number  on moonless nights , a thousand stars are visible in the sky  but when the Queen of Heaven herself appears - Cou .
[ Sneering . ]
The world is struck with wonder at her charms !
Very gallant , my dear Duke !
bravo !
Ric .
I have news for you , ladies !
the Queen 's jealousy is appeased  the Cardinal silenced  and the favorite Duchess de Mailly is dismissed for ever !
Cou .
'T is said that the entertainment given this evening at Court , is intended to celebrate the departure of Madame de Mailly .
Ric .
[ To Marchioness . ]
At the ball of to-night , may I solicit , madam , the honour of your hand ?
Dil .
You must go to this ball , Helena !
Mar. .
At my father 's request , Duke , I shall attend the ball .
Ric .
Ever , madam , at your commands .
[ Crosses to her , and bows . ]
Dil .
We are forgetting the hour of his Majesty 's levee , my dear Richelieu !
[ Looks at his watch . ]
Ric .
[ Looking at the Marchioness . ]
Who could remember it , amid the attractions that surround us !
[ Bows the ladies off , R. ] General , you are happy in possessing such a daughter : I hope you will not find my selfishness unpardonable , if I seek to rob you of her .
Dil .
I should not merit her love , if I only consulted my own wishes - however , you will find me no mean rival , my Lord Duke .
We shall be late at the levee .
Ric .
His Majesty would excuse me , General , having so fair an excuse to plead for my delay .
[ Exeunt , C. ] Scene 3 [ Terrace in the Royal Gardens at Versailles .

Did I not request you , sir , to secure this terrace from intrusion ?
[ Soldiers present arms to the Duke . ]
Who were the ill-looking dogs with whom you were in conference ?
Rafe .
[ Bowing . ]
A select few of your excellent creditors !
I had not so much as a purse to fling at the beasts ' heads .
11 Ric .
[ Throws a purse , which Rafe catches . ]
This for your next occasion !
Be careful that it arrive not over soon .
Rafe .
[ Pockets it . ]
Long live my noble lord !
to be in debt , in favor , and in love !
Ric .

Rafe .
[ Affecting surprise . ]
She !
Ric .
The fair divinity at whose mysterious summons I am here .
Rafe .
Fair divinity !
I conceived it was a dark one your excellency came here to worship !
I thought the Cardinal - Ric .
[ Interrupting . ]
The Cardinal !
when did you know me so assiduous in waiting on an old woman ?
't is with the young ones , sirrah , my interest lies - the young ones , for whose dear sake - [ sighs ] I am about to rush upon destruction !
Rafe .
My lord - Ric .
And commit matrimony !
Yes , Rafe .
I am about to drive one fair creature into ingratitude , and a thousand to despair !
This very morning , on my way from the King , I tendered proposals to General Dillon for the hand of his daughter .
Rafe .
The Marchioness de Clermont .
[ Aside . ]
A woman without a single moral quality - Ric .
How , sirrah !
Rafe .
That is , my lord , without a single louis d'or in the world - Ric .
The old soldier referred me to his daughter , who , heaven reward her charity , appears no way backward in encouragement  for , as I quitted the house , a page whispered an assignation for this terrace at this hour .
Rafe .
The page of Madame de Clermont !
Ric .
He was too well taught to hazard the utterance of his lady 's name : but the place of our meeting , and my heart , assures me 't was from no other .
[ Crosses R. ] Rafe .
Apropos - a lady , masked and attended , is bending her steps this way .
Ric .
'T is herself !
Tis the fair Helena , doubtless !
Richelieu , thou art a happy man !

Ric .
You behold , madam , the most impatient of mankind .
Duc .
[ Hurriedly . ]
I have been intercepted by hundreds of importunate people .
Are we safe here from intrusion ?
Ric .
My people are in waiting yonder .
Rely on their vigilance !
[ The Duchess unmasks . ]
The Duchess de Mailly !!
Duc .
My page surely apprised you !
Ric .
Your page , was it !
Diable !
That is , madame , I scarcely esteemed myself so fortunate .
12 Duc .
You , at least , my dear Duke , do not desert me in my adversity  you have not plotted with my enemies .
You do not revel at the fête with which the Queen has resolved to celebrate my exile from Court .
Ric .
[ Embarrassed . ]
But are you wise , madam , to enhance the victory of your enemies , by thus remaining at Versailles in opposition to the mandate of the King ?
Duc .
What more have I to lose ?
The Queen , the Cardinal , are triumphant !
I am disgraced by him for whom I gave up all !
Ric .
Yet , surely the King will deign - Duc .
Not a word of consolation !
pity would , indeed , deride me !
The King has deceived , betrayed , deserted !
a newer face attracts him , and I am banished !
No matter - I deserve it !
Ric .
A newer face - yet you have ventured .
Duc .
All !
all !
to secure a parting interview with him I love !
to your gallantry , Duke , I appeal , to procure me a secret audience !
Ric .
But how can my poor services be rendered available against the King 's commands ?
Duc .
I have foreseen all !
To-night , during the ball , I shall present myself , masked , at the western door  a word from you to the usher in waiting will secure me admittance .
I implore it in the name of our former friendship .
I demand it in the name of all you love !
Ric .
You shall be obeyed , madame .
I accept the risk !
the door will open at your bidding  your own influence must effect the rest .
[ Enter Rafe , running from U.E.L. ] Rafe .
My lord !
my lord !
the King is seeking you , accompanied by my Lord Cardinal !
Duc .
The Cardinal here !
[ To Richelieu . ]
Whither shall I turn ?
I am lost !
Ric .
Compose yourself .
Resume your mask .
Leave the rest to me .
[ She resumes her mask .
Enter Usher , announcing `` the King . ''
Enter the King , four Pages , Courtiers , Ushers .
They range themselves in the background .
Richelieu bows . ]
King .
You are not easily to be met with , my dear Duke !
I have been in pursuit of you through half the avenues of the gardens .
[ Sees the Duchess . ]
Aha !
a lady !
your retirement is at once explained .
Pardon my intrusion .
[ Going . ]
Ric .
[ Respectfully detaining him . ]
Your Majesty 's gracious presence at this moment - King .
[ Lowering his voice . ]
Might , I fancy , at this moment , be very well dispensed with - [ Crosses R. ] eh , Richelieu ?
Ric .
You are in the mood , sire , for pleasantry .
King .
[ With spirit . ]
Have I not motive to be gay ?
Just emancipated from a chain long grown too heavy for my patience !
In dismissing the de Mailly , I have consulted only my inclinations , whilst I gain the credit of having sacrificed her to the prayers of Fleury , and the tears of the Queen !
Yes , Richelieu , the Cardinal is appeased , the peevish Duchess de Mailly gone , [ She starts . ]
and I am free as air - free to form lighter and happier ties .
Ric .
Yet , the Duchess de Mailly , sire - 13 King .
Name her not !
She has quitted Versailles forever .
Duc .
[ Aside . ]
Oh !
Heavens !
Ric .
[ Aside , approaching her . ]
Command yourself , madam .
King .
[ R. ] Ever complaining - her presence was like the ocean , a perpetual murmur - a frequent storm .
[ The Duchess raises her hands .
The King 's attention is attracted . ]
But I interfere with your engagement , Richelieu  your fair friend here seems to reproach my stay !
Ric .
[ Aside . ]
Permit the lady , sire , to retire unnoticed .
King .
Heaven forbid that I should play the spy upon the gallantries of my friends !
[ Crosses and leads the Duchess to the side . ]
Go , madam , and rely upon it none here will either follow or observe you .
[ To Courtiers . ]
Let no one stir from hence .
[ Bows gallantly on her hand and turns up the stage .
Duchess and servants exeunt .
L. ] Ric .
[ Aside . ]
What a hazard for her , and what an escape for me !
King .
[ Returning , aside . ]
And now , my dear Duke , a word for your private ear .
A mysterious billet was given me this very hour as I left the chapel , bidding me expect a visitor , this evening , in my private apartments .
Ric .
How , sire !
assign a rendezvous to your Majesty ?
King .
[ With affection . ]
To say the truth , I have some slight suspicions who the lady is .
Ric .
Indeed !
[ Aside . ]
Does he suspect the Duchess ?
King .
There is one , my dear duke , to whom my homage has long been silently devoted , one who has hitherto accorded me no grounds for hope .
One who , should she ever smile upon me , will , I feel , obtain a paramount influence over my heart .
Ric .
[ Cautiously . ]
May I presume to ask her name ?
King .
Can you not guess it ?
There is but one so fair - so bright - so lovely - so all commanding !
Ric .
[ Advancing anxiously . ]
And that is - King .
The Marchioness de Clermont !
[ Crosses to R. ] Ric .
Dillon 's daughter !
[ Aside . ]
Confusion !
King .
Prepare all , therefore , for this expected happiness .
Let Lebel be in waiting in the corridor , to escort a lady to my private closet of audience , who will present herself at the western door , as from the ball .
That corridor is obscure enough to enable me to hear her suit , and yet conceal her conscious blushes .
Ric .
Your Majesty commands it !
King .
I command it !
[ Turning to his suite . ]
And now , gentlemen , to the tennis court !
Richelieu !
[ As he goes out . ]
I commend my desires to your vigilance !
[ Exeunt R. , Gentlemen , Usher , King , two Pages , and four Courtiers , two and two . ]
Ric .
[ Solus . ]
If my good fortune waited on my diligence I should owe it a little I fear .
Umph !
The Duchess de Mailly 's influence is gone , that 's clear !
What sottise was it prompted me to promise to introduce her tonight .
However , I did14 not promise to keep her design a secret , so the King shall be informed of her neighborhood , in due time to meet or avoid her .
If she yet lives in his errant fancy , he will see her , her tears will prevail over his irresolution , and her gratitude be mine .
If not , my information will save him from a scene , and give me a new claim on his Majesty , which I 'll take care shall not grow stale in his recollection .
[ Exit . ]
End of Act I Act II Scene 1 [ An apartment at Count Dillon 's .
Enter the Marchioness de Clermont , and the Countess Dillon meeting . ]
Mar. .
You wished to speak to me , madam .
Cou .
I am anxious to learn your intentions towards the Duke of Richelieu .
Mar. .
Intentions !
Cou .
He has this morning proposed for you !
Mar. .
Proposed for me !
Cou .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
For you !
It certainly was not for me he was likely to make proposals .
Mar. .
And my father accepted them ?
Cou .
With submission always to the pleasure of the King , whose wish will be to the General a command .
Mar. .
Without even consulting me !
I know that my poverty is a burthen to him  but I know that he would not sacrifice his child from such a motive .
My father has not affianced me to Richelieu .
Cou .
It is your duty to spare him the alternative by appealing to the King !
Mar. .
True !
I ought not to be an incumbrance on my father-my generous-my noble father !
- by encroaching on his pittance .
I am robbing the soldier 's widow , the soldier 's orphan .
I will speak to the King !
[ Turns up R. ] Cou .
[ Aside . ]
All 's well then , let me but accomplish an interview , her influence is established , and fortune our own .
Mar. .
Were I openly to demand a private audience , my father would guess my motives , and refuse to let me become a suitor to his Majesty .
Cou .
Let all seem unpremeditated : as his majesty retires tonight from the ball , let him find us in the great gallery  he will not pass without addressing you .
Solicit a few minutes audiencethe gallery is obscure , to none other will you be known even .
Mar. .
Tonight !
So soon ?
[ R. ] Cou .
The Duke of Richelieu is urgent in his suit  the General will lose no time in addressing the Kinghis desire expressed in Richelieu 's favor - Mar. .
And I am again sacrificed !
It is too severe a fate !
Cou .
Consider that your interests are those of your father .
No excuses !
No idle apprehensions !
But away to your toilet !
[ Going . ]
Summon up all your charms , and my life on your success !
Expect me in an hour , to accompany you to the circle of the Queen !
15 Mar. .
I go , but still with a heavy heart !
Cou .
The King will prevent your marriage with the Duke .
Courage !
And success !

I 'll never omit the ladies .
Honour to the name of a petticoat !

O ` N. [ Tipsy . ]
As the only representative of royalty present - All .
Oh !
oh !
O ` N. Is myself , gentlemen , one Phaidrig O'Neil , a poor trooper in the Irish Brigade , I 'd be glad to know what king 's health you 're drinking ?
Is it the King of France , whose money you 'll get when he comes to his fortune ?
Or the King of Ulster 's , whose money you never did get , nor ever will get , for the best of all possible reasons-he never had any to give ?
De B. and the others .
Bravo , O'Neil .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Bravo , O'Neil !
O ` N. Speak out like true subjects .

De B .
You regard the reigning dynasties of Europe , then , as mere mushrooms , eh , O'Neil ?
O ` N. [ Heated with wine . ]
And so would you , was it the blood royal of Ulster was coursing through your veins .
Who ever heard , pray , of the16 Bourbons , and Hapsburgs , two thousand years back ?
All .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
O ` N. And was n't the ancient Kings of Ireland , reigning with their gould crowns upon their heads , in glory , ages and ages afore the flood ?
De B .
When their crowns did n't happen to be cracked !
O ` N .
They were too busy breaking bright swords , and broad axes , to be troubled with breaking heads !
Talk of chivalry , your golden eagles , and yer blue garters .
By St. Dennis , and that 's a big oath , the ouldest order of knighthood in the world is the royal Ulster order of the `` Guardians of Jorus , '' and that same was flourishing in all power and glory , according to the best heraldic authority , anno domino , according to the Christian Era , one hundred and one .
All .
One hundred and one !
ha !
ha !
ha !
Aru .
You despise such upstarts , then , as Charlemange , or your Bourbons  eh , O'Neil ?
O ` N. Seed , breed , and generation .
Did n't Gol Mac Moruil 's own cousin to Fin Mac Coul , bate the Danes to perpetual smithereens , when they became besaging him in his castle , in County Latrim  and was n't himself own cousin ancestor to O'Neil , the King of Ulster ?
From whose noble stem , as you all know , I am a broken twig-a scattered leaf , blown from the parent tree , and left to wither on some foreign soil , and be forgotten !
But no matter !
No matter for that !
De B. [ Aside to Arundel . ]
His humour is on him-the moon 's at full-don 't cross his mood .
O ` N. By the powers !
I 'd rather be as I am , of the blood royal of Ulster , with a sword for my sceptre , than reign here at Versailles , over a set of spangled courtiers , and furbelowed dowagers .

Come match me for fightin ' , for frolic , or freak , An Ulster man reigning in glory !
There 's Ajax , and Hector , and bould Agamemnon , Were up to the tricks of our trade !
But the rollikin boys for war , women , and noise , Are the boys of the Irish Brigade !
Chorus .
But the rollikin boys , c. O ` N .
What for should I sing you of Helen of Troy , Or the mischiefs that come of her flirtin '  Sure there 's Biddy O'Flanagan , pride of Fermoy , Twice as much of a Helen-that 's certain .
Then for Venus , Minerva , or Queen Cleopatra , Oh !
bad luck to the word , shall be said By the rollikin boys for war , women , and noise - The boys of the Irish Brigade !
Chorus .
By the rollikin boys , c. O ` N .
What for would I sing ye of classical fun , Of games , boys , Olympic or Partseon ?
Sure the Curragh 's the course , where the known ones done , And there 's Mallon that flogs for divarsion !
For fightin ' !

Here 's the health of King O'Neil !
[ Kneels , L. ] All .
[ Kneeling . ]
The health of King O'Neil !
Hurrah , hurrah !
hurrah !
O ` N. Now , ai n't I a king ?
Any way I 'd like to make that gentleman 's personal acquaintance , who would dispute my regality at this moment .
I 'd measure him for a crown he 'd find uneasy to wear  as Shakespeare , our Irish bard , beautifully expresses it - `` Uneasy is the head that wears a crown ! ''
So I 'd let him know .
Rise up boys , and keep on your legs , if it is quite convenient .
I 'll remit all taxes on pipe-clay  your tailor 's bills shall be recepted gratis  and that 'll be convenient18 to some o ' ye , I believe !
Your marchin ' money shall be doubled !
Ye shall have heaps o ' fightin ' for two-thirds o ' the year , and free quarters for the remaining six months .
All .
Bravo !

Will your majesty permit one of your faithful lieges to escort you to your palace ?
[ Officers go up , get their hats and swords , c..
One brings down O'Neil 's and assists him on with it . ]
O ` N. Will I permit ?
Will a cat eat fish ?
Go before !
Mac .
'T is for your majesty to go before .
O ` N. Never !
when the liquor 's behind me .
That 's a rule : Phaidrig O'Neil , first to advance , last to retire .
Ask the boys .
All .
Aye , aye , all true , your majesty .
O ` N. Write it on my tombstone  and when I 'm beneath it , let me hear any gentleman gainsay it , that 's all .

Well , good night , your majesty !
Good night , to King O'Neil !

As soon as they are off , O'Neil bolts the door and staggers forward . ]
O ` N. Whoo !
I have got all my subjects on the wrong side of the door , and his majesty will try the window .
It 's only one story high , I think  however , I 'll know better about it when I come to the bottom .
Those boys want to lade their master into mischief .
I 'll shew them O'Neil 's not a king to be led by his ministers .
Here goes O'Neil , aboo !
If I get to the ground with whole bones , I 'll drive the world before me this night !
[ Staggers up to the window , opens it , and gets on balcony .
A loud knocking is heard without , S.F.L. Cries of `` O'Neil . '' ]

O'Neil !
What keeps you ?
O'Neil !
O'Neil !
O ` N. Hark !
The populace is getting impatient .
No rioting , you villains !
Aru .
[ Without . ]
O'Neil !
Come along !
[ Coaxing . ]
Wo n't you ?
Wo n't you come with your people ?
O ` N. Indeed I wo n't come .
Familiarity breeds contempt .
I 'll make myself scarce , and my people will like me the better .
Here goes !
Luck 's all !
Look out below !
[ Drops from the window .
Crash and screams heard from below .
The door is burst open , and Arundel and Officers rush on in confusion . ]
Aru .
Where the devil is the king ?
[ Cries without : `` Murder !
Stop him !
Stop him ! '' ]
O ` N. [ Without . ]
Who 'll stop the king ?
Fague a Ballagh !
Mac .
[ Looking out of window . ]
'T is our royal master .
The streets are full of persons of quality thronging to the ball .
He has dropt on a sedan chair , and is off up the street in a gallop !
Ha !
ha !
ha !
O ` C. Drunk as he is , he 's running like a greyhound .
Aru .
We must follow and recover our mad king , or he 'll get into some royal scrape !
After him gentlemen !
Follow !
follow !
All .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Follow the king !
Ha !
ha !

Ric .

Sen. Pass .
King .
'T is most mysterious !
To propose an interview , induce me to quit the ball room  then fail to make her appearance .
Ric .
Be assured , sire , the billet was addressed to you by Madame de Mailly .
King .
To solve that question we have made enquiries at every entrance of the palace  yet you find no Duchess has presented herself .
No , Richelieu , I have still hopes .
Ric .
[ Irritated . ]
As your Majesty pleases .
King .
The lovely de Clermont may have been detained by the Queen-may still linger in the ballroom .
Ric .
Let us return then , sire , let us return to the palace , and clear your doubts .
Let us return to the fete .

What means this strange tumult at the palace gates ?
Ric .

Would he were there now .
King .
The humor of the soldier diverts me .
[ Music heard within the palace , U.E.L. Piano . ]
Discover yourself to the centinel , and bid him offer no opposition to my representative , for such we 'll make our brother king here .
[ Richelieu throws open his cloak , and discovers his blue ribbon to the sentry , who presents arm . ]
Aru .
His Majesty 's guests seem to be making merry .
O ` N. Not at my majesty 's expinse , more luck to the treasury .
Sure is n't it a murdering shame then , for the palace , here , there , and everywhere , to be guarded by a set of whiskered fellows , as big as Bryan Boru , with baggonets on their shoulders , and powdher in their pouches , and never a civil word in their mouths  instead of doors wide open , as in the rale ould ancient times of the King O'Neil , when every mother 's son was welcome , so long as there was a turf on the hearth , or a bite and sup on the board , or a hap ` orth in the bottle .
Aru .
Times are altered .
Times are hard .
O ` N .
You see , Fitz my boy , them ancient Kings O'Neil had never a meddling old woman of a Cardinal keeping them in leading strings , plundering them out of house and home like some I 've heard tell of-but-mum !
Ric .
You hear , sire !
O ` N. Nor tinsel-and-buckram lords in waiting , my darlin ' , to throw away the coin o ' the realm , at Ombre and Lasquenet , like others I 've heard tell of  but mum-again .
King .
You hear , Richelieu .
O ` N. Nor old Duchesses of ladies in waiting , bedizened with diamonds and brick dust , to drive them out of their senses  but mum-again .
Ric .
[ To the King . ]
It were well if Madame de Mailly could profit by this lesson , sire .
King .
I will accost him and promote this interview .
Ric .
I entreat your Majesty to consider .
King .
Nay , 't is my pleasure .
[ Takes off his hat and respectfully addresses O'Neil . ]
Your presence , sire , is impatiently expected at your palace .
O ` N .
At the where ?
King .
At your palace , sire , your majesty is expected .
O ` N .
The devil I am !
Where did he start from !
Faith there 's two of 'em , and two make a pair , as the devil said to shoe buckles King .
Is it your majesty 's pleasure that your chamberlain should announce you ?
[ Pointing to Richelieu . ]
O ` N .
You are a mighty civil gentleman  he shall do that .
[ To Richelieu . ]
Be off with you , my fine fellow , and tell 'em I 'm coming .

Sire , reflect-I - 21 King .
Not a word !
Do you not hear his majesty 's commands ?
O ` N. Yes , do n't you hear his majesty 's commands ?

Hurrah !
Come along , Fitz .
Sure , ai n't I acknowledged at last O'Neil , aboo !
Every inch a king from boot to bonnet !
- barrin ' the best crown I 've got to my head is a Connamara nightcap .
Aru .
For the love of heaven , my dear O'Neil , recollect yourself .
O ` N. Be aisy !
Be aisy !
If I recollect myself , I 'll forget I 'm a king , which everybody else seems to remember perfectly .
Aru .
These strangers are making a jest of you .
O ` N. Are they ?
I 'll see how far their impudence will carry them .
Get out of my way .
Aru .
Retire to your quarters .
O ` N. What !
abdicate before my coronation ?
I scorn it !
Bah !
[ About to enter the palace . ]
Aru .
Surely you 're not thinking ofO'N .
Thinking !
Is it thinking ?
A king to be thinking ?
What for do I pay my ministers ?
So begins the reign of Phaidrig O'Neil , of the fifty-first of the name .
Aru .
One moment 's deliberation .
O ` N. Deliberate for yourself !
See here !
I 'll make you my lord chancellor , and then you 'll have nothing else to do but to deliberate .

Ric .
I am certain , sire , 't is her design to waylay you in the private passage , leading from the Salle de Mars to your own closet .
Will your Majesty have courage to resists her tears ?
King .
I 've too much policy to trust my courage .
She evidently intends to surprise me with a parting scene , so faith she shall have the full benefit of it .
Hark ye , Richelieu , see that the passage is completely darkened , let me be informed when a lady wants me , my Irish representative here shall be ushered towards the private apartments , and on him shall fall her whole battery of tears and reproaches .
[ Crosses to L. ] 'T is fitting , as he shares the honours , that he takes his portion of the penalties of royalty .

It will suffice to shew this ring  a signet given by the late king to your father , to grant him access at all hours to the royal presence .
Mar. [ Taking ring . ]
It will insure admittance ?
Cou .
At every door of the palace .
Go !
[ Looks back . ]
Mar. .
Alone !
I dare not seek the King alone .
Cou .
Remain here then , my dear , and let Richelieu claim you tomorrow .
The alliance is a noble one .
I have no motive to oppose this suit .
Mar. .
Become the wife of the Duke of Richelieu ?
Never !
[ Going  aside . ]
Harry-my hopes-my happiness upon the hazard !
[ Exit , R. ] Cou .
[ Panting as if relieved . ]
At last !
What a waste of eloquence to effect that which every other woman of the Court burns to accomplish-an interview with the King !
Well , the first step is taken  now triumph the impoverished house of Dillon !
[ Exit , L. ] Scene 5 [ Ante-chamber of the private apartments .
On either side , a door , guarded by Pages .
The King 's chair , C. O'Neil , seated  the King attending him as chamberlain .
A suit of Courtiers , Officers , etc. , etc. ] O ` N. [ Rises pompously . ]
Thanks , my good lords !
thanks for loyal civility !
[ Familiarly . ]
I 'd say as much to the ladies , only in this Court the faymale half of the craytion 's wantin '  and in my mind , that half is more than the whole put together !
King .
Your majesty 's household , sire , wait your commands .
O ` N. Let a dinner of superlative magnificence be prepared for tomorrow .
[ Familiarly . ]
Fish , soup , and patties-roasting pig , and everything illegant .
Ush .
[ R. ] For how many guests , your majesty ?
O ` N. Is it for how many , spalpeen ?
For too many to be sure , of course !
Am I such a skinflint as to count my company , like my troop horses ?
Ush .
But the table may be too full , your majesty .
O ` N. Och , my honey !
there never was an Irish table too full yet , while a single guest wanted a corner .
King .
For how many nobles of the Court , sire , shall we issue invitations ?
O ` N. Not to a butterfly of them , I invite General Dillon , and as many as are left of the veterans who fought in the breach at Phillipsbury : and , for once , let the gallant fellows be nobly feasted , within the walls of the king they have bled for .
King .
[ To Usher . ]
You hear this order ?
23 Ush .
The Irish soldiery will doubtless be made welcome within the King 's walls !
[ Sneeringly . ]
O ` N. And why not , Powder Puff , why not ?
The Irish soldiers have made freer than welcome , within the highest walls that encircle the King 's enemies .
King .
Has your majesty no further commands ?
O ` N. Not at present , I 'm intirely obliged to you .
That 's the civilest fellow among them , and very much of a gentleman .
Stay , now I think o n't , there 's a big thief of a Cardinal , somewhere among the ministers .
King .
[ Embarrassed . ]
Sire-I-I-I - O ` N. Aye , aye , aye !
I know he keeps your face to the grindstone  but the first time his Eminence comes with a full claw out of the pocket of the people , grip a hould of his wrist , and squeeze a big pension out of him for ould Count Dillon-too much of a soldier to be rich-too much of a gentleman to own himself poor .
King .
Ha !
O ` N. Ha !
yes .
Next , to Major Francis de Burgh , promotion to a regiment , and the cross of St. Louis .
He won it fairly in the trenches of Phillipsbury .
King .
Major de Burgh .
Who is Major de Burgh ?
O ` N. Oh , ho !
and who the devil 's yourself not to know Major de Burgh ?
Och !
the country is well served by you here .
Not know Major de Burgh .
Why where have you been all your life , man alive ?
To be sure it is not every man alive ought to know everybody that serves him , as well as the King , whose business it is indeed never to lose sight of bravery and merit .
King .
[ R. ] Any other name suggested itself to your majesty ?
O ` N. [ L. ] Bushels o ' names  but we must not make promotion chape .
Stay , I 'd almost forgot  give my-that is-I mean give Sergeant Major Dolan , B troop , second regiment , a cornetcy .
I owe him that turn .
King .
A Sergeant Dolan .
Was his father a gentleman ?
O ` N. That 's hard to answer for  but his mother was , I 'll swear .
She was a Finch , of Rathnadudderygentleman 's blood for seven hundred years , anyway .
There 's not a man in the brigade will carry a standard farther , or kape it better , than Sergeant Dolan , on foot , or on horseback .
King .
There 's one name I would suggest , with your leave , sire .
O ` N .
What name is that now ?
King .
One Captain O'Neil , sire .
O ` N. Who !
who did you say ?
King .
Captain Phaidrig O'Neil .
O ` N. I never heard tell of the fellow-don 't know him from Adam .
Where the devil now did you ever hear tell of his name ?
Eh ?
King .
It has become mentioned with honour in the Gazette , more than once .
O ` N. Aha !
Serve him right !
it 's more than he deserved .
It 's a royal old Milasian name that 's on him any way .
But I say , between you and I , the name is the best of that rascal , and I know him .
24 King .
Your majesty surely accords him some mark of distinction .
O ` N. Well , well , I 'll consult my council o ' war .
Devil a man shall say that King O'Neil 's charity begins at home .
King .
Are we to understand then , sire - O ` N. Oh !
bother-no more understanding or misunderstanding , my chancellor will tell you the rest-and where is my chancellor ?
[ Goes up .
Enter Usher , who whispers to the King , R.C. ] King .
And closely veiled ?
'T is the Duchess de Mailly  bid her await in the small saloon .
My representative shall hear her complaint-he shall legislate in her case .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
[ Enter Richelieu , R.D.F.  Rafe attending with domino and mask . ]
Ric .
[ Comes down C. , bowing . ]
All is prepared for your Majesty in the private gallery .
King .
Have the lights been sufficiently subdued ?
Ric .
They have , sire .
King .
Permit us , sire , to escort you to the ballroom .
O ` N. With all my heart , I love a dance .
Allons !
Ric .
Your majesty 's domino .
O ` N. Oh , aye !
Ric .
Your mask , sire .
O ` N. No , I do n't need it  I 'm not ashamed to shew my own face , or to look in the faces of my subjects .
That 's more than all kings can say , eh ?
King .
Very true , sire .
This way .
O ` N .
A mighty civil man this , I 'll do something for him before I go !
Come , come , let 's go and see the butler , I 've got as dry as a cartridge box .
Lade the way .
[ Richelieu marshals the way for O'Neil and the King , who exeunt ceremoniously , R.D.F. ] Ric .
[ As they exit . ]
Ha !
ha !
ha !
The Irish trooper kings it , as rarely as the true King fools it .
And now , sir , your business ?
Why did you pluck me by sleeve as I crossed the guard room ?
Rafe .
Strange news-rare news for your Excellency .
You may remember , my gracious lord , how eloquently I represented to you the folly of sacrificing your noble person , and ignoble creditors , to the Irish widow .
Ric .
[ Impatiently . ]
Well , sir ?
Rafe .
Know then , my lord , know it with pain and grief , that - [ Enter Arundel , L. ] Ric .
[ Surprised . ]
Your pleasure , sir ?
Aru .
I am in search , my lord , of a gallant officer of the Irish Brigade , whom you and others have made the sport of a frolic , that may lead him into serious trouble here .
Ric .
Fear nothing .
All that has been practiced on Captain O'Neil , has been by order of the King .
Aru .
The King !
Impossible !
25 Ric .
His Majesty and his representative will be back here anon .
You are at liberty to stay and witness the result .
[ Impatiently to Rafe . ]
Now what of the Marchioness de Clermont ?
[ Arundel starts , and seems to retire . ]
Rafe .
[ R. ] While waiting with the domino your lordship ordered on the vestibule , I myself beheld the Marchioness enter from the ballroom , and take her stand within the door of the King 's apartment .
Ric .
[ Aloud . ]
Alone ?
Rafe .
Alone .
Ric .
Without a rendevouz , she would not have been admitted to that gallery .
Are you sure it was the Marchioness de Clermont ?
Rafe .
Certain , the strong light from the outer door shone full on her as she entered .
She is still in that dark gallery , waiting the passing of his Majesty , I imagine , my Lord .
Aru .
Ha !
[ Points to the door of the private apartments , through which exit Arundel . ]
Ric .
So I have escaped the honour of bestowing my name and fortune - Rafe .
Fortune !
say debts !
[ Aside . ]
Ric .
Upon the successor of the de Mailly .
Richelieu , my friend , thy stars have better care of thee than thou deservest .
Rafe .
The stars !
the stars had left your Excellency to your destinies , had not your humble servant watched them and you .
Ric .
The Marchioness !
the prudish Marchioness .
Dupe that I have been .
Rafe .
Hush !
my lord !
her father .
[ Enter Count Dillon , L. ] Dil .
[ Cheerfully . ]
You have been missed , my lord , from the ball room .
We looked for more alacrity in so gallant a lover .
[ Exit Rafe , R.D.F. ] Ric .
[ Coldly . ]
You did me much honour .
Dil .
I had announced to my daughter that your lordship 's homage would be laid this evening at her feet .
Ric .
[ Ironically . ]
Among the numberless votaries of the Marchioness de Clermont , 't is unlikely that a suit , so humble as mine , should have obtained attention .
[ Takes snuff . ]
Dil .
Since when , my dear duke , have you been so diffident ?
Do you suppose I undervalue the honour of your alliance .
Ric .
The honour ?
[ Sneers . ]
Oh !
pardon me !
a poor noble of the realm-a simple subject , like myself .
Dil .
A subject ?
[ Regards him intently . ]
You are facetious , my lord duke !
Reflect that I am past the age of jesting .
Ric .
Indeed !
allow me to condole with you !
I mean to go laughing to my grave  this wicked world affords such food for mirth-ha !
ha !
- for scorn .
Dil .
Again my lord !
Have a care !
This ill-timed merriment seems to connect itself to my daughter .
Ric .
In truth my laughter is ill-timed !
Matrimony is a26 serious business : and now that I am compelled to withdraw my pretensions to the hand of Madame de Clermont - Dil .
Decline my daughter 's hand ?
You will have at least the courtesy to assign a cause for your change of sentiment .
Ric .
To what end ?
Choose any cause you please !
Suppose my affairs embarrassed , my creditors untractable , or say my humility prompts me to resign alliance with the house of Dillon .
[ Takes snuff . ]
Your daughter , sir , has soared too high above me .
Dil .
[ Aside , agitated . ]
Let not his insolence provoke me beyond my self control !
Let me not - [ Aloud . ]
Richelieu , if you are a man , speak out !
no more of these hints , these black , these damnable implications !
speak out .
Ric .
Permit me to refer you , for an explanation , to the Marchioness your aspiring daughter .
Dil .
Presume to name her in that tone again  and I shall forget the sacred place we stand in !
She is my only child , my lord  good , virtuous , fair  I watched over her motherless youth .
I saw her grow to womanhood , pure as the flower fresh opening into beauty !
No cloud has ever rested on her name .
Beware , my lord !
A sneer from lips like yours is fatal .
Beware !
I am old  but when my only child is made a victim [ Raising his arm . ]
there is nerve left here to - [ Gasps . ]
Why do I suffer this thing so to move me !
Ric .
Nay , Count , if you approve her assignations with his Majesty .
Dil .
My lord .
Ric .
Are you aware that this very hour the Marchioness waits yonder [ Points to private apartment . ]
the homage of the King ?
Dil .
[ Draws . ]
Defend yourself .
Ric .
Not while those grey hairs - Dil .
You have insulted them  repair the injury !
Draw , coward .
Ric .
[ Soothingly . ]
Count Dillon .
Count .
Draw !
or I will kill you where I stand .
Ric .
[ Draws . ]
Nay then to my defense !
[ They fight .
Enter the King and Usher , R.D.F. .
They are separated . ]
King .
Richelieu !
What means this outrage ?
Ric .
[ Putting up his sword . ]
Address yourself , my liege , to General Dillon  I drew but in self defense .
King .
Is this your respect for the roof of your sovereign ?
Dil .
The Duke of Richelieu , sire , asserts , my child , my daughter , to be concealed in your apartments .
Have I leave to prove the falsehood of this charge ?
[ About to enter door . ]
King .
Stay !
[ Aside . ]
If it were true !
The billet-my representative is now hearing her appeal .
Dil .
Sire , my honour .
King .
Richelieu is deceived , I fancy .
There is a lady yonder , but 't is the Duchess de Mailly who-27 Dil .
The Duchess de Mailly-so !
You hear my lord !
The Duchess de Mailly .
Ric .
[ Aside . ]
Could Rafe have so blundered ?
Dil .
Sire , you would not trifle with the fame of your oldest soldier 's only child .
King .
You shall be satisfied , Count .
Lead forth the lady , now occupied with my representative .
[ Exit Usher , C.D. ] Dil .
Thanks , sire !
I 'll answer for my Helena with my life .
[ Enter De Burgh , L. ] De B. On the part of Cardinal Fleury , sire - King .
What now ?
speak .
De B. I am charged by his eminence to acquaint your Majesty that , the Duchess de Mailly having been detected in an attempt to intrude herself under sanction of the Duke de Richelieu , she has been this night arrested , and is now on her way into Touraine .
Dil .
Ha !
What do I hear ?
[ In great agitation . ]
Ric .
[ Smiling . ]
Your Majesty , it appears , was mistaken in supposing the Duchess de Mailly to be your guest tonight .
King .
This mystery is inexplicable !
Can he be right ?
Ric .
I have to regret that the petulance of General Dillon should have rendered the whole court witnesses of your Majesty 's good fortune .
Dil .
I defy you , duke .
Forgive me , sire , but my daughter 's fame must not be thus vilely suspected .
King .
'T is just , my lord  you shall be satisfied of our faith .
Lead forth the lady .
Be she whom she may !
[ During these speeches , the Usher enters the private apartments , and leads forth the Marchioness , who unveils , surprised . ]
Mar. .
The King here !
To whom , then , have I pleaded ?
All .
The Marchioness de Clermont .
[ The Marchioness kneels to Dillon . ]
Dil .
[ Throwing her off . ]
Out of my sight !
Go !
Quit this place , and hide your shame for ever !
[ Frantically to the King . ]
What have I done , that you should thus dishonour me ?
I who defended your infancy  I who could have served you with my heart 's blood !
Heaven pardon you !
Heaven pity me that I should be thus wronged in my desolate old age-and by you !
King .
Believe me , my General , IDil .
Your General !
I disclaim the title , and your service !
[ Draws his sword and throws it at the King 's feet . ]
I shall never see my gallant veterans more !
this arm is nerveless now !
[ Sobs . ]
Mar. [ Whose face has been hidden in her hands . ]
Father !
father !
If you ever loved me , only hear me .
Dil .
[ Throwing her off . ]
Away !
your voice is torture to me .
Mar. .
I have a witness  who if a true man will answer for my purpose with the King .
Where is he ?
[ Looking round . ]
I am innocent .
Father , I am innocent .
[ Enter O'Neil , Arundel , Courtiers , c. , R.D.F. ] 28 O ` N. [ Entering . ]
That you are-innocent as I am myself .
All .
[ On seeing Louis . ]
The king !
O ` N .
How well I 'm known .
One would think they 'd seen my coronation !
Now , General , you are welcome  you 're the man of all others-I wanted to see you here .
Dil .
What means this mummery , Captain ?
O ` N .
It means , General , that your daughter here has been on her knees to me in the passage beyond where I could see my nose , and has asked me to intercede for your consent to her marriage with my schoolfellow there , Sir Harry Arundel , who had the assurance to pass himself on me for a Fitzgerald , tho ' I knew the voice the moment I saw it .
Dil .
My nephew , Sir Henry Arundel , a suitor to my daughter ?
Explain these mysteries .
Arun .
Suffice it , my dear uncle , that they entail no disgrace upon you .
Give me your daughter 's hand , and you will confer on me an honour , kings might be proud of .
O ` N. Spoken like a lover and an Irishman , and you shall have my vote .
King .
[ After a word apart with the Usher , comes down , C. ] I see it all !
The lovely Marchioness has made my representative her confidant .
And now , O'Dillon , what excuse can you offer your King ?
O ` N. Aye , General , what can you say to your King ?
Dil .
[ To the King . ]
Sire I confess my fault .
[ Bows . ]
King .
Be it expiated by your consent to the union of your children .
O ` N. Hollo !
My worthy friend , you 're makin ' over free here  not but I must own , you took the very word out of my mouth .
Dil .
[ Kneels . ]
Sire , may I hope for pardon .
O ` N .
Now I 'm bothered !
I say , do you help me out here : you seem to have the speechifying gift .
Say something civil and kind to the ould General .
King .
[ Crossing to General , R. ] Then let me say-the loyal service of fifty years must not be effaced by a single error-let me replace the sword , so long devoted to my defense [ Taking off his sword . ]
by one that will acquire lustre in your hands .
[ Gives it .
King raises Dillon .
All go up C .
He bows on the King 's hand . ]
O ` N. Very well !
My chamberlain seems quite easy in my office  does it as if he 'd been used to it .
Well , we 'll all be king 's in our turn , and turn about 's fair play , as the devil said to the smoke jack .
It 's all right , but now where 's my - [ During this , the King puts on his hat and seats himself .
All form a circle .
Arundel and Marchioness kneeling . ]
King .
Versailles I find can not longer sustain two monarchs .
Either King O'Neil or Louis XV must now lay down the sceptre .
O ` N. [ Looks a moment , then kneels . ]
Och !
Murder !
King Louis himself , by the pope !
I 'll abdicate , and all the retiring pension I ask is-your gracious pardon .
The reign of King O'Neil never before extended beyond our mess-room , and never shall again , for I find the affairs of a Court much too puzzling for any honest man .
King .
Rise , my brave friend  this jest was of my own imagination , but the lesson I have received is29 yours .
I herewith confirm , without reserve , all the just decrees of my honest representative which at once reprove , and repair my own neglects .
Major O'Neil accept my thanks for - O ` N. Major !
Captain O'Neil , sire , at your service .
King .
In my service , Major from this hour , and with the cross of St. Louis .
[ Louis takes cross off his neck and puts it on O'Neil .
Then brings him forward . ]
But , hark ye , Major , no more royal adventures-you comprehend ?
O ` N. [ Kissing the King 's hand . ]
Oh mum !
I 've abdicated entirely .
By the powers , I feel I 'm no longer a king , for I 'm the happiest man alive - [ Sings . ]
Bryan O'Lyn , hem !
King .
[ To Dillon . ]
Count Dillon , let the marriage of your fair daughter be solemnized in the royal chapel .
I charge myself with the dowry of the bride .
But some punishment is due here : Richelieu , you will this night quit Paris .
[ Looks at him .
Richelieu kneels , L. corner . ]
O ` N. Will your Majesty allow me another word .
King .
Oh , by all means , Major .
O ` N .
As your Majesty seems in the height of good humour and I seem in high favour , will you allow me to speak a word for Pilgarlick in the corner here .
King .
Ha !
ha !
Richelieu approach .
You have his Majesty 's pardon .
[ Richelieu kneels and kisses the King 's hands . ]
O ` N. Bless your royal clemency , may you live a thousand years , and I live to bury you , and now if the great Public will but imitate the example of the King , I shall be the happiest monarch that ever laid down a sceptre .
For I shall fall back into the ranks of private life with the conviction that it will be written in history , and go down to my ancestors , that every man , woman , or child , was content under the reign of poor King O'Neil .
[ The King smiles assentingly .
Richelieu kisses his hands .
All form towards the throne bowing .
Picture as curtain falls .

The End
