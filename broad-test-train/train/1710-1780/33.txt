O !
for a few short Moments to tell you how my Heart bleeds for you . ]


PREFACE .


It having been objected to this tragedy , that its language is prose , and its catastrophe too horrible , I shall entreat the reader 's patience for a minute , that I may say a word or two to these objections .


The play of the GAMESTER was intended to be a natural picture of that kind of life , of which all men are judges  and as it struck at a vice so universally prevailing , it was thought proper to adapt its language to the capacities and feelings of every part of the audience : that as some of its characters were of no higher rank than Sharpers , it was imagined that ( whatever good company they may find admittance to in the world ) their speaking blank verse upon the stage would be unnatural , if not ridiculous .
But though the more elevated characters also speak prose , the judicious reader will observe , that it is a species of prose which differs very little from verse : in many of the most animated scenes , I can truly say , that I often found it a much greater difficulty to avoid , than to write , measure .
I shall only add , in answer to this objection , that I hoped to be more interesting , by being more natural  and the event , as far as I have been a witness of it , has more than answered my expectations .


As to the other objection , the horror of its catastrophe , if it be considered simply what that catastrophe is , and compared with those of other tragedies , I should humbly presume that the working it up to any uncommon degree of horror , is the merit of the play , and not its reproach .
Nor should so prevailing and destructive a vice as GAMING be attacked upon the theatre , without impressing upon the imagination all the horrors that may attend it .


I shall detain the reader no longer than to inform him , that I am indebted for many of the most popular passages in this play to the inimitable performer , who , in the character of the Gamester , exceeded every idea I had conceived of it in the writing .


PROLOGUE .


Written and spoken by Mr. GARRICK .


Like fam'd La Mancha 's knight , who launce in hand , Mounted his steed to free th ' enchanted land , Our Quixote bard sets forth a monster-taming , Arm'd at all points , to fight that hydra -- GAMING .
Aloft on Pegasus he waves his pen , And hurls defiance at the caitiff 's den .
The First on fancy'd giants spent his rage , But This has more than windmills to engage : He combats passion , rooted in the soul , Whose pow ` rs , at once delight ye , and controul  Whose magic bondage each lost slave enjoys , Nor wishes freedom , though the spell destroys .
To save our land from this MAGICIAN 's charms , And rescue maids and matrons from his arms , Our knight poetic comes .
And Oh !
ye fair !
This black ENCHANTER 's wicked arts beware !
His subtle poison dims the brightest eyes , And at his touch , each grace and beauty dies : Love , gentleness and joy to rage give way , And the soft dove becomes a bird of prey .
May this our bold advent ` rer break the spell , And drive the demon to his native hell .
Ye slaves of passion , and ye dupes of chance , Wake all your pow ` rs from this destructive trance !
Shake off the shackles of this tyrant vice : Hear other calls than those of cards and dice : Be learn'd in nobler arts , than arts of play , And other debts , than those of honour pay : No longer live insensible to shame , Lost to your country , families and fame .
Could our romantic muse this work atchieve , Would there one honest heart in Britain grieve ?
Th ' attempt , though wild , would not in vain be made , If every honest hand would lend its aid .

THE GAMESTER .


A TRAGEDY .


ACT I. SCENE I .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , and CHARLOTTE .


Mrs. Beverley .
Be comforted , my dear  all may be well yet .
And now , methinks , the lodgings begin to look with another face .
O sister !
sister !
if these were all my hardships  if all I had to complain of were no more than quitting my house , servants , equipage and show , your pity would be weakness .


Char .
Is poverty nothing then ?


Mrs. Bev .
Nothing in the world , if it affected only Me .
While we had a fortune , I was the happiest of the rich : and now 't is gone , give me but a bare subsistance , and my husband 's smiles , and I 'll be the happiest of the poor .
To Me now these lodgings want nothing but their master .
Why d'you look so at me ?


Char .
That I may hate my brother .


Mrs. Bev .
Do n't talk so , Charlotte .


Char .
Has he not undone you ?
Oh !
this pernicious vice of gaming !
But methinks his usual hours of four or five in the morning might have contented him  't was misery enough to wake for him till then : need he have staid out all night ?
I shall learn to detest him .


Mrs. Bev .
Not for the first fault .
He never slept from me before .


Char .
Slept from you !
No , no  his nights have nothing to do with sleep .
How has this one vice driven him from every virtue !
nay , from his affections too !
-- The time was , sister --


Mrs. Bev .
And is .
I have no fear of his affections .
Would I knew that he were safe !


Char .
From ruin and his companions .
But that 's impossible .
His poor little boy too !
What must become of Him ?


Mrs. Bev .
Why , want shall teach him industry .
From his father 's mistakes he shall learn prudence , and from his mother 's resignation , patience .
Poverty has no such terrors in it as you imagine .
There 's no condition of life , sickness and pain excepted , where happiness is excluded .
The needy peasant , who rises early to his labour , enjoys more welcome rest at night for ` t. His bread is sweeter to him  his home happier  his family dearer  his enjoyments surer .
The sun that rouses him in the morning , sets in the evening to release him .
All situations have their comforts , if sweet contentment dwell in the heart .
But my poor Beverley has none .
The thought of having ruined those he loves , is misery for ever to him .
Would I could ease his mind of That !


Char .
If He alone were ruined , ` twere just he should be punished .
He is my brother , 't is true  but when I think of what he has done  of the fortune You brought him  of his own large estate too , squandered away upon this vilest of passions , and among the vilest of wretches !
O !
I have no patience !
My own little fortune is untouched , he says : would I were sure o n't !


Mrs. Bev .
And so you may  'twould be a sin to doubt it .


Char .
I will be sure o n't .
'T was madness in me to give it to his management .
But I 'll demand it from him this morning .
I have a melancholy occasion for ` t .


Mrs. Bev .
What occasion ?


Char .
To support a sister .


Mrs. Bev .
No  I have no need o n't .
Take it , and reward a lover with it .
The generous Lewson deserves much more .
Why wo n't you make him happy ?


Char .
Because my sister 's miserable .


Mrs. Bev .
You must not think so .
I have my jewels left yet .
I 'll sell them to supply our wants  and when all 's gone these hands shall toil for our support .
The poor should be industrious -- Why those tears , Charlotte ?


Char .
They flow in pity for you .


Mrs. Bev .
All may be well yet .
When he has nothing to lose , I shall fetter him in these arms again  and then what is it to be poor ?


Char .
Cure him but of this destructive passion , and my uncle 's death may retrieve all yet .


Mrs. Bev .
Ay , Charlotte , could we cure him .
But the disease of play admits no cure but poverty  and the loss of another fortune would but encrease his shame and his affliction .
Will Mr. Lewson call this morning ?


Char .
He said so last night .
He gave me hints too , that he had suspicions of our friend Stukely .


Mrs. Bev .
Not of treachery to your Brother ?
That he loves play I know  but surely he is honest .


Char .
He would fain be thought so  therefore I doubt him .
Honesty needs no pains to set itself off .


Mrs. Bev .
What now , Lucy ?


SCENE II .


Enter LUCY .


Lucy .
Your old steward , madam .
I had not the heart to deny him admittance , the good old man begged so hard for it .
[ Exit .


SCENE III .


Enter JARVIS .


Mrs. Bev .
Is this well , Jarvis ?
I desired you to avoid me .


Jar .
Did you , madam ?
I am an old man , and had forgot .
Perhaps too you forbad my tears  but I am old , madam , and age will be forgetful .


Mrs. Bev .
The faithful creature !
how he moves me !
[ To Charlotte .


Char .
Not to have seen him had been cruelty .


Jar .
I have forgot these apartments too .
I remember none such in my young master 's house  and yet I have lived i n't these five and twenty years .
His good father would not have dismissed me .


Mrs. Bev .
He had no reason , Jarvis .


Jar .
I was faithful to him while he lived , and when he died , he bequeathed me to his son .
I have been faithful to Him too .


Mrs. Bev .
I know it , I know it , Jarvis .


Char .
We both know it .


Jar .
I am an old man , madam , and have not a long time to live .
I asked but to have died with him , and he dismissed me .


Mrs. Bev .
Prithee no more of this !
'T was his poverty that dismissed you .


Jar .
Is he indeed so poor then ?
Oh !
he was the joy of my old heart .
But must his creditors have all ?
And have they sold his house too ?
His father built it when He was but a prating boy .
The times I have carried him in these arms !
And , Jarvis , says he , when a beggar has asked charity of me , why should people be poor ?
You sha n't be poor , Jarvis  if I was a king , nobody should be poor .
Yet He is poor .
And then he was so brave !
-- O , he was a brave little boy !
And yet so merciful , he 'd not have killed the gnat that stung him .


Mrs. Bev .
Speak to him , Charlotte  for I can not .


Char .
When I have wiped my eyes .


Jar .
I have a little money , madam  it might have been more , but I have loved the poor .
All that I have is yours .


Mrs. Bev .
No , Jarvis  we have enough yet .
I thank you though , and will deserve your goodness .


Jar .
But shall I see my master ?
And will he let me attend him in his distresses ?
I 'll be no expence to him : and ` twill kill me to be refused .
Where is he , madam ?


Mrs. Bev .
Not at home , Jarvis .
You shall see him another time .


Char .
To-morrow , or the next day .
O , Jarvis !
what a change is here !


Jar .
A change indeed , madam !
My old heart akes at it .
And yet methinks -- But here 's somebody coming .


SCENE IV .


Enter LUCY with STUKELY .


Lucy .
Mr. Stukely , Madam .
[ Exit .


Stu .
Good morning to you , Ladies .
Mr. Jarvis , your servant .
Where 's my friend , madam ?
[ To Mrs. Beverley .


Mrs. Bev .
I should have asked that question of You .
Have not you seen him to-day ?


Stu .
No , madam .


Char .
Nor last night ?


Stu .
Last night !
Did not he come home then ?


Mrs. Bev .
No .
Were not you together ?


Stu .
At the beginning of the evening  but not since .
Where can he have staid ?


Char .
You call yourself his friend , Sir  why do you encourage him in this madness of gaming ?


Stu .
You have asked me that question before , madam  and I told you my concern was that I could not save him .
Mr. Beverley is a man , madam  and if the most friendly entreaties have no effect upon him , I have no other means .
My purse has been his , even to the injury of my fortune .
If That has been encouragement , I deserve censure  but I meant it to retrieve him .


Mrs. Bev .
I do n't doubt it , Sir  and I thank you .
But where did you leave him last night ?


Stu .
At Wilson 's , madam , if I ought to tell  in company I did not like .
Possibly he may be there still .
Mr. Jarvis knows the house , I believe .


Jar .
Shall I go , madam ?


Mrs. Bev .
No  he may take it ill .


Char .
He may go as from himself .


Stu .
And if he pleases , madam , without naming Me .
I am faulty myself , and should conceal the errors of a friend .
But I can refuse nothing here .
[ Bowing to the ladies .


Jar .
I would fain see him , methinks .


Mrs. Bev .
Do so then .
But take care how you upbraid him .
I have never upbraided him .


Jar .
Would I could bring him comfort !
[ Exit .


Stu .
Do n't be too much alarmed , madam .
All men have their errors , and their times of seeing them .
Perhaps my friend 's time is not come yet .
But he has an uncle  and old men do n't live for ever .
You should look forward , madam : we are taught how to value a second fortune by the loss of a first .
[ A knocking at the door .


Mrs. Bev .
Hark !
-- No  that knocking was too rude for Mr. Beverley .
Pray heaven he be well !


Stu .
Never doubt it , madam .
You shall be well too : every thing shall be well .
[ Knocking again .


Mrs. Bev .
The knocking is a little loud though .
Who waits there ?
Will none of you answer ?
-- None of you , did I say ?
Alas !
I thought myself in my own house , surrounded with servants .


Char .
I 'll go , sister -- But do n't be alarmed so .
[ Exit .


Stu .
What extraordinary accident have you to fear , madam ?


Mrs. Bev .
I beg your pardon  but 't is ever thus with me in Mr. Beverley 's absence .
No one knocks at the door , but I fancy 't is a messenger of ill news .


Stu .
You are too fearful , madam  't was but one night of absence  and if ill thoughts intrude ( as love is always doubtful ) think of your worth and beauty , and drive them from your breast .


Mrs. Bev .
What thoughts ?
I have no thoughts that wrong my husband .


Stu .
Such thoughts indeed would wrong him .
The world is full of slander  and every wretch that knows himself unjust , charges his neighbour with like passions  and by the general frailty , hides his own .
If you are wise , and would be happy , turn a deaf ear to such reports : 't is ruin to believe them .


Mrs. Bev .
Ay , worse than ruin .
` Twould be to sin against conviction .
Why was it mentioned ?


Stu .
To guard you against rumour .
The sport of half mankind is mischief  and for a single error they make men devils .
If their tales reach you , disbelieve them .


Mrs. Bev .
What tales ?
By whom ?
Why told ?
I have heard nothing  or if I had , with all his errors , my Beverley 's firm faith admits no doubt .
It is my safety  my seat of rest and joy , while the storm threatens round me .
I 'll not forsake it .
( Stukely sighs , and looks down ) Why turn you from me ?
And why that sigh ?


Stu .
I was attentive , madam  and sighs will come we know not why .
Perhaps I have been too busy .
If it should seem so , impute my zeal to friendship , that meant to guard you against evil tongues .
Your Beverley is wronged  slandered most vilely .
My life upon his truth .


Mrs. Bev .
And mine too .
Who is 't that doubts it ?
But no matter -- I am prepared , Sir .
-- Yet why this caution ?
-- You are my husband 's friend  I think you mine too  the common friend of both .
( Pauses ) I had been unconcerned else .


Stu .
For heaven 's sake , madam , be so still !
I meant to guard you against suspicion , not to alarm it .


Mrs. Bev .
Nor have you , Sir .
Who told you of suspicion ?
I have a heart it can not reach .


Stu .
Then I am happy -- I would say more , but am prevented .


SCENE V .


Re-enter CHARLOTTE .


Mrs. Bev .
Who was it , Charlotte ?


Char .
What a heart has that Jarvis !
-- A creditor , sister .
But the good old man has taken him away .
Do n't distress his wife !
Do n't distress his sister !
I could hear him say .
'T is cruel to distress the afflicted .
And when he saw me at the door , he begged pardon that his friend had knocked so loud .


Stu .
I wish I had known of this .
Was it a large demand , madam ?


Char .
I heard not that  but visits such as these , we must expect often .
Why so distressed , sister ?
This is no new affliction .


Mrs. Bev .
No , Charlotte  but I am faint with watching 


quite sunk and spiritless .
Will you excuse me , Sir ?
I 'll to my chamber , and try to rest a little .


Stu .
Good thoughts go with you , madam .
[ Exit Mrs. Beverley .
My bait is taken then .
( Aside . )
Poor Mrs. Beverley !
How my heart grieves to see her thus !


Char .
Cure her , and be a friend then .


Stu .
How cure her , madam ?


Char .
Reclaim my brother .


Stu .
Ay  give him a new creation  or breathe another soul into him .
I 'll think o n't , madam .
Advice , I see , is thankless .


Char .
Useless I am sure it is , if through mistaken friendship , or other motives , you feed his passion with your purse , and sooth it by example .
Physicians , to cure fevers , keep from the patient 's thirsty lip the cup that would inflame him  You give it to his hands .
( A knocking . )
Hark , Sir !
These are my brother 's desperate symptoms .
Another creditor .


Stu .
One not so easily got rid of -- What , Lewson !


SCENE VI .


Enter LEWSON .


Lew .
Madam , your servant .
Yours , Sir .
I was enquiring for you at your lodgings .


Stu .
This morning ?
You had business then ?


Lew .
You 'll call it by another name , perhaps .
Where 's Mr. Beverley , madam ?


Char .
We have sent to enquire for him .


Lew .
Is he abroad then ?
He did not use to go out so early .


Char .
No  nor to stay out so late .


Lew .
Is that the case ?
I am sorry for it .
But Mr. Stukely , perhaps , may direct you to him .


Stu .
I have already , Sir .
But what was your business with Me ?


Lew .
To congratulate you upon your late successes at play .
Poor Beverley !
But You are his friend  and there 's a comfort in having successful friends .


Stu .
And what am I to understand by this ?


Lew .
That Beverley 's a poor man , with a rich friend  that 's all .


Stu .
Your words would mean something , I suppose .
Another time , Sir , I shall desire an explanation .


Lew .
And why not now ?
I am no dealer in long sentences .
A minute or two will do for me .


Stu .
But not for Me , Sir .
I am slow of apprehension , and must have time and privacy .
A lady 's presence engages my attention .
Another morning I may be found at home .


Lew .
Another morning then , I 'll wait upon you .


Stu .
I shall expect you , Sir .
Madam , your servant .
[ Exit .


Char .
What mean you by this ?


Lew .
To hint to him that I know him .


Char .
How know him ?
Mere doubt and supposition !


Lew .
I shall have proof soon .


Char .
And what then ?
Would you risk your life to be his punisher ?


Lew .
My life , madam !
Do n't be afraid .
And yet I am happy in your concern for me .
But let it content you that I know this Stukely .
` Twould be as easy to make him honest as brave .


Char .
And what d'you intend to do ?


Lew .
Nothing , till I have proof .
Yet my suspicions are well-grounded .
But methinks , madam , I am acting here without authority .
Could I have leave to call Mr. Beverley brother , his concerns would be my own .
Why will you make my services appear officious ?


Char .
You know my reasons , and should not press me .
But I am cold , you say : and cold I will be , while a poor sister 's destitute .
My heart bleeds for her !
and till I see her sorrows moderated , love has no joys for me .
Lew .
Can I be less a friend by being a brother ?
I would not say an unkind thing  but the pillar of your house is shaken .
Prop it with another , and it shall stand firm again .
You must comply .


Char .
And will , when I have peace within myself .
But let us change the subject .
Your business here this morning is with my sister .
Misfortunes press too hard upon her : yet till to day she has borne them nobly .


Lew .
Where is she ?


Char .
Gone to her chamber .
Her spirits failed her .


Lew .
I hear her coming .
Let what has passed with Stukely be a secret .
She has already too much to trouble her .


SCENE VII .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY .


Mrs. Bev .
Good morning , Sir .
I heard your voice , and , as I thought , enquiring for me .
Where 's Mr. Stukely , Charlotte ?


Char .
This moment gone .
You have been in tears , sister  but here 's a friend shall comfort you .


Lew .
Or if I add to your distresses , I 'll beg your pardon , madam .
The sale of your house and furniture was finished yesterday .


Mrs. Bev .
I know it , Sir .
I know too your generous reason for putting me in mind of it .
But you have obliged me too much already .


Lew .
There are trifles , madam , which you have set a value on : those I have purchased , and will deliver .
I have a friend too that esteems you  he has bought largely , and will call nothing his , till he has seen you .
If a visit to him would not be painful , he has begged it may be this morning .


Mrs. Bev .
Not painful in the least .
My pain is from the kindness of my friends .
Why am I to be obliged beyond the power of return ?


Lew .
You shall repay us at your own time .
I have a coach waiting at the door .
Shall we have Your company , madam ?
[ To Charlotte .


Char .
No .
My brother may return soon  I 'll stay and receive him .


Mrs. Bev .
He may want a comforter , perhaps .
But do n't upbraid him , Charlotte .
We sha n't be absent long .
Come , Sir , since I must be so obliged .


Lew .
'T is I that am obliged .
An hour or less will be sufficient for us .
We shall find you at home , madam ?
( To Charlotte . )
[ Exit with Mrs. Beverley .


Char .
Certainly .
I have but little inclination to appear abroad .
O !
this brother !
this brother !
to what wretchedness has he reduced us !
[ Exit .


SCENE VIII .
Changes to STUKELY 'S lodgings .


Enter STUKELY .


Stu .
That Lewson suspects me , 't is too plain .
Yet why should he suspect me ?
I appear the friend of Beverley as well as he .
But I am rich it seems : and so I am  thanks to another 's folly and my own wisdom .
To what use is wisdom , but to take advantage of the weak ?
This Beverley 's my fool : I cheat him , and he calls me friend .
But more business must be done yet .
His wife 's jewels are unsold 


so is the reversion of his uncle 's estate .
I must have these too .
And then there 's a treasure above all .
I love his wife .
Before she knew this Beverley , I loved her  but like a cringing fool , bowed at a distance , while He stept in and won her .
Never , never will I forgive him for it .
My pride , as well as love , is wounded by this conquest .
I must have vengeance .
Those hints , this morning , were well thrown in .
Already they have fastened on her .
If jealousy should weaken her affections , want may corrupt her virtue .
My hate rejoyces in the hope .
These jewels may do much .
He shall demand them of her  which , when mine , shall be converted to special purposes .
-- What now , Bates ?


SCENE IX .


Enter BATES .


Bates .
Is it a wonder then to see me ?
The forces are in readiness , and only wait for orders .
Where 's Beverley ?


Stu .
At last night 's rendezvous , waiting for Me .
Is Dawson with you ?


Bates .
Dressed like a nobleman  with money in his pocket , and a set of dice that shall deceive the devil .


Stu .
That fellow has a head to undo a nation .
But for the rest , they are such low-mannered , ill-looking dogs , I wonder Beverley has not suspected them .


Bates .
No matter for manners and looks : do You supply them with money , and they are gentlemen by profession .
The passion of gaming casts such a mist before the eyes , that the nobleman shall be surrounded with sharpers , and imagine himself in the best company .


Stu .
There 's that Williams too : it was He , I suppose , that called at Beverley 's with the note this morning .
What directions did you give him ?


Bates .
To knock loud , and be clamorous .
Did not you see him ?


Stu .
No .
The fool sneaked off with Jarvis .
Had he appeared within-doors , as directed , the note had been discharged .
I waited there on purpose .
I want the women to think well of me  for Lewson 's grown suspicious  he told me so himself .


Bates .
What answer did you make him ?


Stu .
A short one .
That I would see him soon , for farther explanation .


Bates .
We must take care of him .
But what have we to do with Beverley ?
Dawson and the rest are wondering at you .


Stu .
Why let them wonder .
I have designs above Their narrow reach .
They see me lend him money  and they stare at me .
But they are fools .
I want him to believe me beggared by him .


Bates .
And what then ?


Stu .
Ay , there 's the question  but no matter .
At night you may know more .
He waits for me at Wilson 's .
I told the women where to find him .


Bates .
To what purpose ?


Stu .
To save suspicion .
It looked friendly  and they thanked me .
Old Jarvis was dispatched to him .


Bates .
And may intreat him home .


Stu .
No  he experts money from me : but I 'll have none .
His wife 's jewels must go .
Women are easy creatures , and refuse nothing where they love .
Follow me to Wilson 's  but besure he sees you not .
You are a man of character , you know  of prudence and discretion .
Wait for me in an outer room  I shall have business for you presently .
Come , Sir .


Let drudging fools by honesty grow great  The shorter road to riches is deceit .


[ Exeunt .


ACT II .


SCENE a gaming house , with a table , box , dice , c..


BEVERLEY is discovered sitting .


Beverley .
Why , what a world is this !
The slave that digs for gold , receives his daily pittance , and sleeps contented  while those , for whom he labours , convert their good to mischief  making abundance the means of want .
O shame !
shame !
Had fortune given me but a little , that little had been still my own .
But plenty leads to waste  and shallow streams maintain their currents , while swelling rivers beat down their banks , and leave their channels empty .
What had I to do with play ?
I wanted nothing .
My wishes and my means were equal .
The poor followed me with blessings  love scattered roses on my pillow , and morning waked me to delight .
-- O , bitter thought !
that leads to what I was , by what I am !
I would forget both -- Who 's there ?


SCENE II .


Enter a WAITER .


Wait .
A gentleman , Sir , enquires for you .


Bev .
He might have used less ceremony .
Stukely I suppose ?


Wait .
No , Sir  a stranger .


Bev .
Well , shew him in .
( Exit Waiter . )
A messenger from Stukely then .
From Him that has undone me !
Yet all in friendship  and now he lends me from his little , to bring back fortune to me .


SCENE III .


Enter JARVIS .


Jarvis !
Why this intrusion ?
-- Your absence had been kinder .


Jar .
I came in duty , Sir .
If it be troublesome --


Bev .
It is .
I would be private  hid even from myself .
Who sent you hither ?


Jar .
One that would persuade you home again .
My mistress is not well  her tears told me so .


Bev .
Go with thy duty there then .
But does she weep ?
I am to blame to let her weep .
Prithee begone  I have no business for thee .


Jar .
Yes , Sir  to lead you from this place .
I am your servant still .
Your prosperous fortune blessed my old age .
If That has left you , I must not leave you .


Bev .
Not leave me !
Recall past time then  or through this sea of storms and darkness , shew me a star to guide me .
But what can ` st Thou ?


Jar .
The little that I can , I will .
You have been generous to me .
I would not offend you , Sir -- but --


Bev .
No .
Think ` st thou I 'd ruin Thee too ?
I have enough of shame already .
My wife !
my wife !
Would ` st thou believe it , Jarvis ?
I have not seen her all this long night  I , who have loved her so , that every hour of abscence seemed as a gap in life .
But other bonds have held me .
O !
I have played the boy  dropping my counters in the stream , and reaching to redeem them , have lost Myself .
Why wilt Thou follow misery ?
Or if thou wilt , go to thy mistress -- She has no guilt to sting her , and therefore may be comforted .


Jar .
For pity 's sake , Sir !
I have no heart to see this change .


Bev .
Nor I to bear it .
How speaks the world of me , Jarvis ?


Jar .
As of a good man dead .
Of one , who walking in a dream , fell down a precipice .
The world is sorry for you .


Bev .
Ay , and pities me .
Says it not so ?
But I was born to infamy .
I 'll tell thee what it says .
It calls me villain  a treacherous husband  a cruel father  a false brother  one lost to nature and her charities -- Or to say all in one short word , it calls me -- Gamester .
Go to thy mistress  I 'll see her presently .


Jar .
And why not now ?
Rude people press upon her  loud , bawling creditors  wretches , who know no pity .
I met one at the door  he would have seen my mistress -- I wanted means of present payment , so promised it to-morrow .
But others may be pressing  and she has grief enough already .
Your absence hangs too heavy on her .


Bev .
Tell her I 'll come then .
I have a moment 's business .
But what hast Thou to do with My distresses ?
Thy honesty has left thee poor  and age wants comfort .
Keep what thou hast for cordials  left between thee and the grave , misery steal in .
I have a friend shall counsel me -- This is that friend .


SCENE IV .


Enter STUKELY .


Stu .
How fares it , Beverley ?
Honest Mr. Jarvis , well met  I hoped to find you here .
That viper Williams !
Was it not He that troubled you this morning ?


Jar .
My mistress heard him then ?
I am sorry that she heard him .


Bev .
And Jarvis promised payment .


Stu .
That must not be .
Tell him I 'll satisfy him .


Jar .
Will you , Sir ?
Heaven will reward you for ` t .


Bev .
Generous Stukely !
Friendship like yours , had it ability like will , would more than ballance the wrongs of fortune .


Stu .
You think too kindly of me .
Make haste to Williams  his clamours may be rude else .
[ To Jarvis .


Jar .
And my master will go home again .
Alas !
Sir , we know of hearts there breaking for his absence .
[ Exit .


Bev .
Would I were dead !


Stu .
Or turned hermit  counting a string of beads in a dark cave  or under a weeping willow , praying for mercy on the wicked .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Prithee be a man , and leave dying to disease and old age .
Fortune may be ours again  at least , we 'll try for ` t .


Bev .
No , it has fooled us on too far .


Stu .
Ay , ruined us  and therefore we 'll sit down contented .
These are the despondings of men without money  but let the shining ore chink in the pocket , and folly turns to wisdom .
We are fortune 's children .
True , she 's a fickle mother  but shall We droop because She 's peevish ?
No  she has smiles in store .
And these her frowns are meant to brighten them .


Bev .
Is this a time for levity ?
But You are single in the ruin , and therefore may talk lightly of it .
With Me 't is complicated misery .


Stu .
You censure me unjustly .
I but assumed these spirits to chear my friend .
Heaven knows he wants a comforter .


Bev .
What new misfortune ?


Stu .
I would have brought you money  but lenders want securities .
What 's to be done ?
All that was mine is yours already .


Bev .
And there 's the weight that sinks me .
I have undone my friend too  one , who to save a drowning wretch , reached out his hand , and perished with him .


Stu .
Have better thoughts .


Bev .
Whence are they to proceed ?
I have nothing left .


Stu .
( Sighing ) Then we 're indeed undone .
What , nothing ?
No moveables ?
nor useless trinkets ?
Bawbles , locked up in caskets , to starve their owners ?
I have ventured deeply for you .


Bev .
Therefore this heart-ake  for I am lost beyond all hope .


Stu .
No : means may be found to save us .
Jarvis is rich .
Who made him so ?
This is no time for ceremony .


Bev .
And is it for dishonesty ?
The good old man !
Shall I rob Him too ?
My friend would grieve for ` t. No  let the little that he has , buy food and cloathing for him .


Stu .
Good morning then .
[ Going .


Bev .
So hasty !
Why , then good morning .


Stu .
And when we meet again , upbraid me .
Say it was I that tempted you .
Tell Lewson so  and tell him I have wronged you : he has suspicions of me , and will thank you .


Bev , No  we have been companions in a rash voyage , and the same storm has wrecked us both .
Mine shall be self-upbraidings .


Stu .
And will they feed us ?
You deal unkindly by me .
I have sold and borrowed for you , while land or credit lasted  and now , when fortune should be tried , and my heart whispers me success , I am deserted  turned loose to beggary , while You have hoards .


Bev .
What hoards ?
Name them , and take them .


Stu .
Jewels .


Bev .
And shall this thriftless hand seize Them too ?
My poor , poor wife !
Must she lose all ?
I would not wound her so .


Stu .
Nor I , but from necessity .
One effort more , and fortune may grow kind .
I have unusual hopes .


Bev .
Think of some other means then .


Stu .
I have  and you rejected them .


Bev .
Prithee let me be a man .


Stu .
Ay , and your friend a poor one .
But I have done .
And for these trinkets of a woman , why , let her keep them to deck out pride with , and shew a laughing world that she has finery to starve in .


Bev .
No  she shall yield up all .
My friend demands it .
But need he have talked lightly of her ?
The jewels that She values are truth and innocence : those will adorn her ever  and for the rest , she wore them for a husband 's pride , and to his wants will give them .
Alas !
you know her not .
Where shall we meet ?


Stu .
No matter .
I have changed my mind .
Leave me to a prison  't is the reward of friendship .


Bev .
Perish mankind first !
Leave you to a prison !
No : fallen as you see me , I 'm not that wretch .
Nor would I change this heart , overcharged as 't is with folly and misfortune , for one most prudent and most happy , if callous to a friend 's distresses .


Stu .
You are too warm .


Bev .
In such a cause , not to be warm is to be frozen .
Farewell .
I 'll meet you at your lodgings .


Stu .
Reflect a little .
The jewels may be lost .
Better not hazard them .
I was too pressing .


Bev .
And I ungrateful .
Reflection takes up time .
I have no leisure for ` t. Within an hour expect me .
[ Exit .


Stu .
The thoughtless , shallow prodigal !
We shall have sport at night then -- But hold -- the jewels are not ours yet .
The lady may refuse them .
The husband may relent too .
'T is more than probable -- I 'll write a note to Beverley , and the contents shall spur him to demand them .
But am I grown this rogue through avarice ?
No  I have warmer motives : love and revenge .
Ruin the husband , and the wife 's virtue may be bid for .
'T is of uncertain value , and sinks , or rises in the purchase , as want , or wealth , or passion governs .
The poor part cheaply with it  rich dames , though pleased with selling , will have high prices for ` t  your love-sick girls give it for oaths and lying  but wives , who boast of honour and affections , keep it against a famine .
Why , let the famine come then  I am in haste to purchase .


SCENE V .


Enter BATES .


Look to your men , Bates  there 's money stirring .
We meet to-night upon this spot .
Hasten and tell them so .
Beverley calls upon me at my lodgings , and we return together .
Hasten , I say  the rogues will scatter else .


Bates .
Not till their leader bids them .


Stu .
Come on then .
Give them the word , and follow me  I must advise with you .
This is a day of business .
[ Exeunt .


SCENE VI .
changes to BEVERLEY 'S lodgings .


Enter BEVERLEY , and CHARLOTTE .


Char .
Your looks are changed too  there 's wildness in them .
My wretched sister !
how will it grieve her to see you thus !


Bev .
No , no  a little rest will ease me .
And for your Lewson 's kindness to her , it has my thanks : I have no more to give him .


Char .
Yes  a sister and her fortune .
I trifle with him  and he complains .
My looks , he says , are cold upon him .
He thinks too --


Bev .
That I have lost your fortune -- He dares not think so .


Char .
Nor does he -- You are too quick at guessing .
He cares not if you had .
That care is mine .
I lent it you to husband  and now I claim it .


Bev .
You have suspicions then ?


Char .
Cure them , and give it me .


Bev .
To stop a sister 's chiding .


Char .
To vindicate her brother .


Bev .
How if he needs it not ?


Char .
I would fain hope so .


Bev .
Ay , would and can not .
Leave it to time then  ` twill satisfy all doubts .


Char .
Mine are already satisfied .


Bev .
'T is well .
And when the subject is renewed , speak to me like a sister , and I will answer like a brother .


Char .
To tell me I 'm a beggar .
Why , tell it now .
I that can bear the ruin of those dearer to me , the ruin of a sister and her infant , can bear that too .


Bev .
No more of this -- You wring my heart .


Char .
Would that the misery were all your own !
But innocence must suffer .
Unthinking rioter !
whose home was heaven to him : an angel dwelt there , and a little cherub , that crowned his days with blessings -- How has he lost this heaven , to league with devils !


Bev .
Forbear , I say  reproaches come too late  they search , but cure not .
And for the fortune you demand , we 'll talk to-morrow o n't  our tempers may be milder .


Char .
Or if 't is gone , why , farewel all .
I claimed it for a sister .
She holds my heart in hers  and every pang She feels , tears it in pieces -- But I 'll upbraid no more .
What heaven permits , it may ordain  and sorrow then is sinful .
Yet that the husband !
father !
brother !
should be its instrument of vengeance !
-- 'T is grievous to know that .


Bev .
If you 're my sister , spare the remembrance -- It wounds too deeply .
To-morrow shall clear all  and when the worst is known , it may be better than your fears .
Comfort my wife  and for the pains of absence , I 'll make atonement .
The world may yet go well with us .


Char .
See where she comes !
-- Look chearfully upon her .
Affections , such as hers , are prying  and lend those eyes that read the soul .


SCENE VII .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , and LEWSON .


Mrs. Bev .
My life !


Bev .
My love !
How fares it ?
I have been a truant husband .


Mrs. Bev .
But we meet now , and that heals all .
Doubts and alarms I have had  but in this dear embrace I bury and forget them .
My friend here ( pointing to Lewson ) has been indeed a friend .
Charlotte , 't is You must thank him : your brother 's thanks and mine are of too little value .


Bev .
Yet what we have , we 'll pay .
I thank , you , Sir , and am obliged .
I would say more , but that your goodness to the wife , upbraids the husband 's follies .
Had I been wise , She had not trespassed on your bounty .


Lew .
Nor has she trespassed .
The little I have done , acceptance over-pays .


Char .
So friendship thinks --


Mrs. Bev .
And doubles obligations , by striving to conceal them -- We 'll talk another time o n't .
You are too thoughtful , love .


Bev .
No  I have reason for these thoughts .


Char .
And hatred for the cause .
Would you had that too !


Bev .
I have .
The cause was avarice .


Char .
And who the tempter ?


Bev .
A ruined friend .
Ruined by too much kindness ,


Lew .
Ay , worse than ruined  stabbed in his fame  mortally stabbed .
Riches ca n't cure him .


Bev .
Or if they could , those I have drained him of .
Something of this he hinted in the morning -- that Lewson had suspicions of him -- Why these suspicions ?
[ Angrily .


Lew .
At school we knew this Stukely .
A cunning plodding boy he was , sordid and cruel .
Slow at his talk , but quick at shifts and tricking .
He schemed out mischief , that others might be punished  and would tell his tale with so much art , that for the lash he merited , rewards and praise were given him .
Shew me a boy with such a mind , and time that ripens manhood in him , shall ripen vice too .
I 'll prove him , and lay him open t ` you .
Till then be warned .
I know him , and therefore shun him .


Bev .
As I would those that wrong him .
You are too busy , Sir .


Mrs. Bev .
No , not too busy -- Mistaken perhaps -- That had been milder .


Lew .
No matter , madam .
I can bear this , and praise the heart that prompts it .
Pity such friendship should be so placed !


Bev .
Again , Sir !
-- But I 'll bear too .
You wrong him , Lewson , and will be sorry for ` t .


Char .
Ay , when 't is proved he wrongs him .
The world is full of hypocrites .


Bev .
And Stukely one -- So you 'd infer , I think .
I 'll hear no more of this -- My heart akes for him -- I have undone him .


Lew .
The world says otherwise .


Bev .
The world is false then .
I have business with you , love .
( To Mrs. Beverley . )
We 'll leave them to their rancour .
[ Going .


Char .
No .
We shall find room within for ` t. Come this way , Sir .
[ To Lewson .


Lew .
Another time my friend will thank me  that time is hastening too .
[ Exit with Charlotte .


Bev .
They hurt me beyond bearing .
Is Stukely false ?
Then honesty has left us !


` Twere sinning against heaven to think so .


Mrs. Bev .
I never doubted him .


Bev .
No  You are charity .
Meekness and ever-during patience live in that heart , and love that knows no change -- Why did I ruin you ?


Mrs. Bev .
You have not ruined me .
I have no wants when You are present , nor wishes in your absence , but to be blest with your return .
Be but resigned to what has happened , and I am rich beyond the dreams of avarice .


Bev .
My generous girl !
-- But memory will be busy  still crowding on my thoughts , to sour the present by the past .
I have another pang too .


Mrs. Bev .
Tell it , and let me cure it .


Bev .
That friend , that generous friend , whose fame they have traduced -- I have undone Him too .
While he had means , he lent me largely  and now a prison must be his portion .


Mrs. Bev .
No  I hope otherwise .


Bev .
To hope must be to act .
The charitable wish feeds not the hungry .
Something must be done .


Mrs. Bev .
What ?


Bev .
In bitterness of heart he told me , just now he told me , I had undone him .
Could I hear that , and think of happiness ?
No  I have disclaimed it , while He is miserable .


Mrs. Bev .
The world may mend with us , and then we may be grateful .
There 's comfort in that hope .


Bev .
Ay  't is the sick man 's cordial , his promised cure  while in preparing it , the patient dies .
-- What now ?


SCENE VIII .


Enter LUCY .


Lucy .
A letter , Sir .
[ Delivers it , and exit .


Bev .
The hand is Stukely 's .
[ Opens , and reads it to himself .


Mrs. Bev .
And brings good news -- at least I 'll hope so -- What says he , love ?


Bev .
Why , this -- too much for patience .
Yet he directs me to conceal it from you .
[ Reads .


Let your haste to see me be the only proof of your esteem for me .
I have determined , since we parted , to bid adieu to England  chusing rather to forsake my country , than to owe my freedom in it to the means we talked of .
Keep this a secret at home , and hasten to the ruined R. STUKELY


Ruined by friendship !
I must relieve , or follow him .


Mrs. Bev .
Follow him , did you say ?
Then I am lost indeed !


Bev .
O this infernal vice !
how has it sunk me !
A vice , whose highest joy was poor to my domestic happiness .
Yet how have I pursued it !
Turned all my comforts to bitterest pangs !
and all Thy smiles to tears .
Damned , damned infatuation !


Mrs. Bev .
Be cool , my life !
What are the means the letter talks of ?
Have You , have I those means ?
Tell me , and ease me .
I have no life while You are wretched .


Bev .
No , no  it must not be .
'T is I alone have sinned  't is I alone must suffer .
You shall reserve those means , to keep my child and his wronged mother from want and wretchedness .


Mrs. Bev .
What means ?


Bev .
I came to rob you of them  but can not -- dare not  those jewels are your sole support -- I should be more than monster to request them .


Mrs. Bev .
My jewels !
Trifles , not worth the speaking of , if weighed against a husband 's peace  but let them purchase That , and the world 's wealth is of less value .


Bev .
Amazing goodness !
How little do I seem before such virtues !


Mrs. Bev .
No more , my love .
I kept them till occasion called to use them  now is the occasion , and I 'll resign them chearfully .


Bev .
Why , we 'll be rich in love then -- But this excess of kindness melts me .
Yet for a friend one would do much .
He has denied Me nothing .


Mrs. Bev .
Come to my closet -- But let him manage wisely .
We have no more to give him .


Bev .
Where learnt my love this excellence ?
'T is heaven 's own teaching  that heaven , which to an angel 's form , has given a mind more lovely .
I am unworthy of you , but will deserve you better .


Henceforth my follies and neglects shall cease , And all to come be penitence and peace  Vice shall no more attract me with her charms , Nor pleasure reach me , but in these dear arms .


[ Exeunt .


ACT III .


SCENE I. STUKELY 'S lodgings .


Enter STUKELY , and BATES .


Stukely .
So runs the world , Bates .
Fools are the natural prey of knaves  nature designed them so , when she made lambs for wolves .
The laws that fear and policy have framed , nature disclaims : she knows but two  and those are force and cunning .
The nobler law is force  but then there 's danger i n't  while cunning , like a skilful miner , works safely and unseen .


Bat .
And therefore wisely .
Force must have nerves and sinews  cunning wants neither .
The dwarf that has it , shall trip the giant 's heels up .


Stu .
And bind him to the ground .
Why , we 'll erect a shrine for nature , and be her oracles .
Conscience is weakness  fear made , and fear maintains it .
The dread of shame , inward reproaches , and fictitious burnings , swell out the phantom .
Nature knows none of this  Her laws are freedom .


Bat .
Sound doctrine , and well delivered !


Stu .
We are sincere too , and practice what we teach .
Let the grave pedant say as much -- But now to business .
The jewels are disposed of  and Beverley again worth money .
He waits to count his gold out , and then comes hither .
If my design succeeds , this night we finish with him .
Go to your lodgings , and be busy .
You understand conveyances , and can make ruin sure .


Bat .
Better stop here .
The sale of this reversion may be talked of  there 's danger i n't .


Stu .
No  't is the mark I aim at .
We 'll thrive , and laugh .
You are the purchaser , and there 's the payment .
( Giving a pocket book . )
He thinks you rich  and so you shall be .
Enquire for titles , and deal hardly  ` twill look like honesty .


Bat .
How if he suspects us ?


Stu .
Leave it to Me .
I study hearts , and when to work upon them .
Go to your lodgings  and if we come , be busy over papers .
Talk of a thoughtless age , of gaming and extravagance , you have a face for ` t .


Bat .
A feeling too that would avoid it .
We push too far  but I have cautioned you .
If it ends ill , you 'll think of me  and so adieu .
[ Exit .


Stu .
This fellow sins by halves  his fears are conscience to him .
I 'll turn these fears to use .
Rogues that dread shame , will still be greater rogues to hide their guilt -- This shall be thought of .
Lewson grows troublesome -- we must get rid of him -- he knows too much .
I have a tale for Beverley  part of it truth too .
He shall call Lewson to account .
If it succeeds , 't is well  if not , we must try other means -- But here he comes -- I must dissemble .


SCENE II .


Enter BEVERLEY .


Look to the door there !
( In a seeming fright . )
-- My friend !
-- I thought of other visitors .


Bev .
No : these shall guard you from them .
( Offering notes ) Take them , and use them cautiously .
The world deals hardly by us .


Stu .
And shall I leave you destitute ?
No : Your wants are greatest .
Another climate may treat me kinder .
The shelter of to-night takes me from this .


Bev .
Let these be your support then .
Yet is there need of parting ?
I may have means again  we 'll share them , and live wisely .


Stu .
No .
I should tempt you on .
Habit is nature in me  ruin ca n't cure it .
Even now I would be gaming .
Taught by experience as I am , and knowing this poor sum is all that 's left us , I am for venturing still .
And say I am to blame  yet will this little supply our wants ?
No  we must put it out to usury .
Whether 't is madness in me , or some resistless impulse of good fortune , I yet am ignorant  but --


Bev .
Take it , and succeed then .
I 'll try no more .


Stu .
'T is surely impulse  it pleads so strongly -- But You are cold -- we 'll e ` en part here then .
And for this last reserve , keep it for better uses  I 'll have none o n't .
I thank you though , and will seek fortune singly -- One thing I had forgot --


Bev .
What is it ?


Stu .
Perhaps , ` twere best forgotten .
But I am open in my nature , and zealous for the honour of my friend -- Lewson speaks freely of you .


Bev .
Of You I know he does .


Stu .
I can forgive him for ` t  but for my friend I 'm angry .


Bev .
What says he of me ?


Stu .
That Charlotte 's fortune is embezzled .
He talks o n't loudly .


Bev .
He shall be silenced then -- How heard you of it ?


Stu .
From many .
He questioned Bates about it .
You must account with him , he says .


Bev .
Or He with Me -- and soon too .


Stu .
Speak mildly to him .
Cautions are best .


Bev .
I 'll think o n't -- But whither go you ?


Stu .
From poverty and prisons -- No matter whither .
If fortune changes you may hear from me .


Bev .
May these be prosperous then .
( Offering the notes , which he refuses ) Nay , they are yours  I have sworn it , and will have nothing .
Take them and use them .


Stu .
Singly I will not .
My cares are for my friend  for his lost fortune , and ruined family .
All separate interests I disclaim .
Together we have fallen  together we must rise .
My heart , my honour , both will have it so .


Bev .
I am weary of being fooled .


Stu .
And so am I .
Here let us part then .
These bodings of good-fortune shall be stifled  I 'll call them folly , and forget them .
This one embrace , and then farewel .
[ Offering to embrace .


Bev .
No  stay a moment -- How my poor heart 's distracted !
I have these bodings too  but whether caught from You , or prompted by my good or evil genius , I know not -- The trial shall determine -- And yet , my wife --


Stu .
Ay , ay , she 'll chide .


Bev .
No  My chidings are all here .
[ Pointing to his heart .


Stu .
I 'll not persuade you .


Bev .
I am persuaded  by reason too  the strongest reason -- necessity .
Oh !
could I once regain the height I have fallen from , heaven should forsake me in my latest hour , if I again mixed in these scenes , or sacrificed the husband 's peace , his joy and best affections to avarice and infamy !


Stu .
I have resolved like You  and since our motives are so honest , why should we fear success ?


Bev .
Come on then .
Where shall we meet ?


Stu , At Wilson 's -- Yet if it hurts you , leave me : I have misled you often .


Bev .
We have misled each other -- But come !
Fortune is fickle , and may be tired with plaguing us .
There let us rest our hopes .


Stu .
Yet think a little .


Bev .
I can not -- Thinking but distracts me .


When desperation leads , all thoughts are vain  Reason would lose , what rashness may obtain .


[ Exeunt .


SCENE III .
BEVERLEY 'S lodgings .
Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , and CHARLOTTE .


Char .
'T was all a scheme , a mean one  unworthy of my brother .


Mrs. Bev .
No , I am sure it was not .
Stukely is honest too  I know he is .
This madness has undone them both .


Char .
My brother irrecoverably .
You are too spiritless a wife -- A mournful tale , mixt with a few kind words , will steal away your soul .
The world 's too subtle for such goodness .
Had I been by , he should have asked your life sooner than those jewels .


Mrs. Bev .
He should have had it then .
( Warmly ) I live but to oblige him .
She who can love , and is beloved like Me , will do as much .
Men have done more for mistresses , and women for a base deluder .
And shall a wife do less ?
Your chidings hurt me , Charlotte .


Char .
And come too late  they might have saved you else .
How could he use you so ?


Mrs. Bev .
'T was friendship did it .
His heart was breaking for a friend .


Char .
The friend that has betrayed him .


Mrs. Bev .
Prithee do n't think so .


Char .
To-morrow he accounts with Me .


Mrs. Bev .
And fairly : I will not doubt it .


Char .
Unless a friend has wanted -- I have no patience -- Sister !
sister !
we are bound to curse this friend .


Mrs. Bev .
My Beverley speaks nobly of him .


Char .
And Lewson truly -- But I displease you with this talk -- To-morrow will instruct us .


Mrs. Bev .
Stay till it comes then .
I would not think so hardly .


Char .
Nor I , but from conviction .
Yet we have hope of better days .
My uncle is infirm , and of an age that threatens hourly .
Or if he lives , You never have offended him  and for distresses so unmerited , he will have pity .


Mrs. Bev .
I know it , and am chearful .
We have no more to lose  and for what 's gone , if it brings prudence home , the purchase is well made .


Char .
My Lewson will be kind too .
While he and I have life and means , You shall divide with us -- And see , he 's here .


SCENE IV .


Enter LEWSON .


We were just speaking of you .


Lew .
'T is best to interrupt you then .
Few characters will bear a scrutiny  and where the bad out-weighs the good , he 's safest that 's least talked of .
What say you , madam ?
[ To Charlotte .


Char .
That I hate scandal , though a woman  therefore talk seldom of you .


Mrs. Bev .
Or , with more truth , that , though a woman , she loves to praise  therefore talks always of you .
I 'll leave you to decide it .
[ Exit .


Lew .
How good and amiable !
I came to talk in private with you  of matters that concern you .


Char .
What matters ?


Lew .
First answer me sincerely to what I ask .


Char .
I will -- But you alarm me .


Lew .
I am too grave , perhaps  but be assured of this , I have no news that troubles Me , and therefore should not You .


Char .
I am easy then .
Propose your question .


Lew .
'T is now a tedious twelve-month , since with an open and kind heart , you said you loved me .


Char .
So tedious , did you say ?


Lew .
And when in consequence of such sweet words , I pressed for marriage , you gave a voluntary promise , that you would live for Me .


Char .
You think me changed then ?
[ Angrily .


Lew .
I did not say so .
A thousand times I have pressed for the performance of this promise  but private cares , a brother 's and a sister 's ruin , were reasons for delaying it .


Char .
I had no other reasons -- Where will this end ?


Lew .
It shall end presently .


Char .
Go on , Sir .


Lew .
A promise , such as this , given freely , not extorted , the world thinks binding  but I think otherwise .


Char .
And would release me from it ?


Lew .
You are too impatient , madam .


Char .
Cool , Sir -- quite cool -- Pray go on .


Lew .
Time , and a near acquaintance with my faults , may have brought change : if it be so  or , for a moment , if you have wished this promise were unmade , here I acquit you of it .
This is my question then  and with such plainness as I ask it , I shall entreat an answer .
Have you repented of this promise ?


Char .
Stay , Sir .
The man that can suspect me , shall find me changed .
Why am I doubted ?


Lew .
My doubts are of myself .
I have my faults , and You have observation .
If from my temper , my words or actions , you have conceived a thought against me , or even a wish for separation , all that has passed is nothing .


Char .
You startle me -- But tell me -- I must be answered first .
Is it from honour you speak this ?
or do you wish me changed ?


Lew .
Heaven knows I do not .
Life and my Charlotte are so connected , that to lose one , were loss of both .
Yet for a promise , though given in love , and meant for binding  if time , or accident , or reason should change opinion , with Me that promise has no force .


Char .
Why , now I 'll answer you .
Your doubts are prophecies -- I am really changed .


Lew .
Indeed !


Char .
I could torment You now , as You have Me  but 't is not in my nature .
That I am changed I own  for what at first was inclination , is now grown reason in me  and from that reason , had I the world -- nay , were I poorer than the poorest , and You too wanting bread  with but a hovel to invite me to -- I would be yours , and happy .


Lew .
My kindest Charlotte !
( Seizing her hand ) Thanks are too poor for this , and words too weak !
But if we love so , why should our union be delayed ?


Char .
For happier times .
The present are too wretched .


Lew .
I may have reasons , that press it now .


Char .
What reasons ?


Lew .
The strongest reasons  unanswerable ones .


Char .
Be quick and name them .


Lew .
No , madam  I am bound in honour to make conditions first  I am bound by inclination too .
This sweet profusion of kind words pains while it pleases .
I dread the losing you .


Char .
Astonishment !
What mean you ?


Lew .
First promise , that to-morrow , or the next day , you will be mine for ever .


Char .
I do -- though misery should succeed .


Lew .
Thus then I seize you !
and with you every joy on this side heaven !
[ Embracing her .


Char .
And thus I seal my promise .
( Returning his embrace . )
Now , Sir , your secret ?


Lew .
Your fortune 's lost .


Char .
My fortune lost !
-- I 'll study to be humble then .
But was my promise claimed for this ?
How nobly generous !
Where learnt you this sad news ?


Lew .
From Bates , Stukely 's prime agent .
I have obliged him , and he 's grateful .
He told it me in friendship , to warn me from my Charlotte .


Char .
'T was honest in him  and I 'll esteem him for ` t .


Lew .
He knows much more than he has told .


Char .
For Me it is enough .
And for your generous love , I thank you from my soul .
If you 'd oblige me more , give me a little time .


Lew .
Why time ?
It robs us of our happiness .


Char .
I have a task to learn first .
The little pride this fortune gave me , must be subdued .
Once we were equal  and might have met obliging and obliged .
But now 't is otherwise  and for a life of obligations , I have not learnt to bear it .


Lew .
Mine is that life .
You are too noble .


Char .
Leave me to think o n't .


Lew .
To-morrow then you 'll fix my happiness ?


Char .
All that I can , I will .


Lew .
It must be so  we live but for each other .
Keep what you know a secret  and when we meet to-morrow , more may be known .
Farewell .
[ Exit .


Char .
My poor , poor sister !
how would this wound her !
But I 'll conceal it , and speak comfort to her .
Exit .


SCENE V. changes to a room in the gaming-house .


Enter BEVERLEY , and STUKELY .


Bev .
Whither would you lead me ?
[ Angrily .


Stu .
Where we may vent our curses .


Bev .
Ay , on yourself , and those damned counsels that have destroyed me .
A thousand fiends were in that bosom , and all let loose to tempt me -- I had resisted else .


Stu .
Go on , Sir .
I have deserved this from you .


Bev .
And curses everlasting .
Time is too scanty for them .


Stu .
What have I done ?


Bev .
What the arch-devil of old did -- soothed with false hopes , for certain ruin .


Stu .
Myself unhurt  nay , pleased at your destruction -- So your words mean .
Why , tell it to the world : I am too poor to find a friend i n't .


Bev .
A friend !
What 's he ?
I had a friend .


Stu .
And have one still .


Bev .
Ay  I 'll tell you of this friend .
He found me happiest of the happy  fortune and honour crowned me  and love and peace lived in my heart .
One spark of folly lurked there  That too he found  and by deceitful breath , blew it to flames that have consumed me .
This friend were You to Me .


Stu .
A little more perhaps -- The friend who gave his all to save you  and not succeeding , chose ruin with you .
But no matter -- I have undone you , and am a villain .


Bev .
No  I think not .
The villains are within .


Stu .
What villains ?


Bev .
Dawson and the rest -- We have been dupes to sharpers .


Stu .
How know you this ?
I have had doubts , as well as You  yet still as fortune changed , I blushed at my own thoughts .
But You have proofs , perhaps ?


Bev .
Ay , damned ones .
Repeated losses : night after night , and no reverse .
Chance has no hand in this .


Stu .
I think more charitably  yet I am peevish in my nature , and apt to doubt .
The world speaks fairly of this Dawson  so does it of the rest .
We have watched them closely too .
But 't is a right usurped by losers , to think the winners knaves .
We 'll have more manhood in us .


Bev .
I know not what to think .
This night has stung me to the quick -- blasted my reputation too .
I have bound my honour to these vipers  played meanly upon credit , till I tired them  and now they shun me , to rifle one another .
What 's to be done ?


Stu .
Nothing .
My counsels have been fatal .


Bev .
By heaven !
I 'll not survive this shame -- Traitor !
't is You have brought it on me .
( Taking hold of him . )
Shew me the means to save me , or I 'll commit a murder here , and next upon myself .


Stu .
Why , do it then , and rid me of ingratitude .


Bev .
Prithee , forgive this language -- I speak I know not what .
Rage and despair are in my heart , and hurry me to madness .
My home is horror to me -- I 'll not return to ` t. Speak quickly  tell me , if in this wreck of fortune , one hope remains ?
Name it , and be my oracle .


Stu .
To vent your curses on -- You have bestowed them liberally .
Take your own counsel : and should a desperate hope present itself , ` twill suit your desperate fortune .
I 'll not advise you .


Bev .
What hope ?
By heaven !
I 'll catch at it , however desperate .
I am so sunk in misery , it can not lay me lower .


Stu .
You have an uncle .


Bev .
Ay .
What of Him ?


Stu .
Old men live long by temperance  while their heirs starve on expectation .


Bev .
What mean you ?


Stu .
That the reversion 's yours  and will bring money to pay debts with -- nay , more  it may retrieve what 's past .


Bev .
Or leave my child a beggar .


Stu .
And what 's his father ?
A dishonourable one  engaged for sums , he can not pay .
That should be thought of .


Bev .
It is my shame  the poison that inflames me .
Where shall we go ?
To whom ?
I am impatient till all 's lost .


Stu .
All may be yours again .
Your man is Bates .
He has large funds at his command , and will deal justly by you .


Bev .
I am resolved -- Tell them , within , we 'll meet them presently  and with full purses too -- Come , follow me .


Stu .
No .
I 'll have no hand in this  nor do I counsel it .
Use your discretion , and act from that .
You 'll find me at my lodgings .


Bev .
Succeed what will , this night I 'll dare the worst -- 'T is loss of fear , to be compleatly curs'd .
[ Exit .


Stu .
Why , lose it then for ever .
Fear is the mind 's worst evil  and 't is a friendly office to drive it from the bosom .
Thus far has fortune crowned me -- Yet Beverley is rich  rich in his wife 's best treasure  her honour and affections .
I would supplant him there too .
But 't is the curse of thinking minds , to raise up difficulties .
Fools only conquer women : fearless of dangers which they see not , they press on boldly , and by persisting , prosper .
Yet may a tale of art do much .
Charlotte is sometimes absent .
The seeds of jealousy are sown already : If I mistake not , they have taken root too .
Now is the time to ripen them , and reap the harvest .
The softest of her sex , if wronged in love , or thinking that she 's wronged , becomes a tygress in revenge .
I 'll instantly to Beverley 's -- No matter for the danger -- When beauty leads us on , 't is indiscretion to reflect , and cowardice to doubt .
[ Exit .


SCENE VI .
changes to BEVERLEY 'S lodgings .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , and Lucy .


Mrs. Bev .
Did Charlotte tell you any thing ?


Lucy .
No , madam .


Mrs. Bev .
She looked confused methought  said she had business with her Lewson  which , when I pressed to know , tears only were her answer .


Lucy .
She seemed in haste too : yet her return may bring you comfort .


Mrs. Bev .
No , my kind girl  I was not born for ` t .
But why do I distress thee ?
Thy sympathizing heart bleeds for the ills of others .
What pity that thy mistress ca n't reward thee !
But there 's a power above , that sees , and will remember all .
Prithee , sooth me with the song thou sung ` st last night : it suits this change of fortune  and there 's a melancholy i n't that pleases me .


Lucy .
I fear it hurts you , madam .
Your goodness too draws tears from me : but I 'll dry them , and obey you .


SONG .


When Damon languish'd at my feet , And I believ'd him true , The moments of delight how sweet !
But ah !
how swift they flew !
The sunny hill , the flow ` ry vale , The garden and the grove , Have echoed to his ardent tale , And vows of endless love .


II .


The conquest gain'd , he left his prize , He left her to complain  To talk of joy with weeping eyes , And measure time by pain .
But heav'n will take the mourner 's part , In pity to despair  And the last sigh that rends the heart , Shall waft the spirit there .


Mrs. Bev .
I thank thee , Lucy  I thank heaven too my griefs are none of these .
Yet Stukely deals in hints -- He talks of rumours -- I 'll urge him to speak plainly -- Hark ?
-- There 's some one entering .


Lucy .
Perhaps my master , madam .
[ Exit .


Mrs. Bev .
Let him be well too , and I am satisfied .
( Goes to the door , and listens . )
No  't is another 's voice  his had been music to me .
Who is it , Lucy ?


SCENE VII .


Re-enter LUCY with STUKELY .


Lucy .
Mr. Stukely , madam .
[ Exit .


Stu .
To meet you thus alone , madam , was what I wished .
Unseasonable visits , when friendship warrants them , need no excuse  therefore I make none .


Mrs. Bev .
What mean you , Sir ?
And where 's your friend ?


Stu .
Men may have secrets , madam , which their best friends are not admitted to .
We parted in the morning , not soon to meet again .


Mrs. Bev .
You mean to leave us then ?
To leave your country too ?
I am no stranger to your reasons , and pity your misfortunes .


Stu .
Your pity has undone you .
Could Beverley do this ?
That letter was a false one  a mean contrivance , to rob you of your jewels .
I wrote it not .


Mrs. Bev .
Impossible !
Whence came it then ?


Stu .
Wronged as I am , madam , I must speak plainly --


Mrs. Bev .
Do so , and ease me .
Your hints have troubled me .
Reports , you say , are stirring -- Reports of whom ?
You wished me not to credit them .
What , Sir , are these reports ?


Stu .
I thought them slander , madam  and cautioned you in friendship  left from officious tongues the tale had reached you , with double aggravation .


Mrs. Bev .
Proceed , Sir .


Stu .
It is a debt due to my fame , due to an injured wife too -- We both are injured .


Mrs. Bev .
How injured ?
and who has injured us ?


Stu .
My friend , your husband .


Mrs. Bev .
You would resent for both then ?
But know , Sir , My injuries are my own , and do not need a champion .


Stu .
Be not too hasty , madam .
I come not in resentment , but for acquittance .
You thought me poor  and to the feigned distresses of a friend gave up your jewels .


Mrs. Bev .
I gave them to a husband .


Stu .
Who gave them to a --


Mrs. Bev .
What ?
Whom did he give them to ?


Stu .
A mistress .


Mrs. Bev .
No  on my life he did not .


Stu .
Himself confessed it , with curses on her avarice .


Mrs. Bev .
I 'll not believe it .
He has no mistress -- or if he has , why is it told to Me ?


Stu .
To guard you against insults .
He told me , that to move you to compliance , he forged that letter , pretending I was ruined  ruined by Him too .
The fraud succeeded  and what a trusting wife bestowed in pity , was lavished on a wanton .


Mrs. Bev .
Then I am lost indeed  and my afflictions are too powerful for me .
His follies I have borne without upbraiding , and saw the approach of poverty without a tear .
My affections , my strong affections supported me through every trial .


Stu .
Be patient , madam .


Mrs. Bev .
Patient !
The barbarous man !
And does he think my tenderness of heart is his security for wounding it ?
But he shall find that injuries such as these , can arm my weakness for vengeance and redress .


Stu .
Ha !
then I may succeed .
( Aside . )
Redress is in your power .


Mrs. Bev .
What redress ?


Stu .
Forgive me , madam , if in my zeal to serve you , I hazard your displeasure .
Think of your wretched state .
Already want surrounds you .
Is it in patience to bear That ?
To see your helpless little one robbed of his birth-right ?
A sister too , with unavailing tears , lamenting her lost fortune ?
No comfort left you , but ineffectual pity from the Few , out-weighed by insults from the Many ?


Mrs. Bev .
Am I so lost a creature ?
Well , Sir , my redress ?


Stu .
To be resolved is to secure it .
The marriage vow , once violated , is in the sight of heaven dissolved -- Start not , but hear me !
'T is now the summer of your youth  time has not cropt the roses from your cheek , though sorrow long has washed them .
Then use your beauty wisely  and , freed by injuries , fly from the cruellest of men , for shelter with the kindest .


Mrs. Bev .
And who is He ?


Stu .
A friend to the unfortunate  a bold one too  who while the storm is bursting on your brow , and lightening flashing from your eyes , dares tell you that he loves you .


Mrs. Bev .
Would that these eyes had heaven 's own lightening !
that with a look , thus I might blast thee !
Am I then fallen so low ?
Has poverty so humbled me , that I should listen to a hellish offer , and sell my soul for bread ?
O , villain !
villain !
-- But now I know thee , and thank thee for the knowledge .


Stu .
If you are wife , you shall have cause to thank me .


Mrs. Bev .
An injured husband too shall thank thee .


Stu .
Yet know , proud woman , I have a heart as stubborn as your own  as haughty and imperious : and as it loves , so can it hate .


Mrs. Bev .
Mean , despicable villain !
I scorn thee , and thy threats .
Was it for this that Beverley was false ?
That his too credulous wife should in despair and vengeance give up her honour to a wretch ?
But he shall know it , and vengeance shall be his .


Stu .
Why send him for defiance then .
Tell him I love his wife  but that a worthless husband forbids our union .
I 'll make a widow of you , and court you honourably .


Mrs. Bev .
O , coward !
coward !
thy soul will shrink at him .
Yet in the thought of what may happen , I feel a woman 's fears .
Keep thy own secret , and begone .
Who 's there ?


SCENE VIII .


Enter LUCY .


Your absence , Sir , would please me .


Stu .
I 'll not offend you , madam .
[ Exit with Lucy .


Mrs. Bev .
Why opens not the earth to swallow such a monster ?
Be conscience then his punisher , till heaven in mercy gives him penitence , or dooms him in its justice .


SCENE IX .


Re-enter LUCY .


Come to my chamber , Lucy  I have a tale to tell thee , shall make thee weep for thy poor mistress .


Yet heav'n the guiltless sufferer regards , And whom it most afflicts , it most rewards .


[ Exeunt .


ACT IV .


SCENE , BEVERLEY 'S lodgings .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , CHARLOTTE , and LEWSON .


Charlotte .
The smooth-tongued hypocrite !


Lew .
But we have found him , and will requite him .
Be chearful , madam  ( To Mrs. Beverley ) and for the insults of this ruffian , you shall have ample retribution .


Mrs. Bev .
But not by violence -- Remember you have sworn it : I had been silent else .


Lew .
You need not doubt me  I shall be cool as patience .


Mrs. Bev .
See him to-morrow then .


Lew .
And why not now ?
By heaven , the veriest worm that crawls is made of braver spirit than this Stukely .
Yet for my promise , I 'll deal gently with him .
I mean to watch his looks : from those , and from his answers to my charge , much may be learnt .
Next I 'll to Bates , and sift him to the bottom .
If I fail there , the gang is numerous , and for a bribe will each betray the other .
Good night  I 'll lose no time .
[ Exit .


Mrs. Bev .
These boisterous spirits !
how they wound me !
But reasoning is in vain .
Come , Charlotte  we 'll to our usual watch .
The night grows late .


Char .
I am fearful of events  yet pleased -- To-morrow may relieve us .
[ Going .


SCENE II .


Enter JARVIS .


Char .
How now , good Jarvis ?


Jar .
I have heard ill news , madam .


Mrs. Bev .
What news ?
Speak quickly .


Jar .
Men are not what they seem .
I fear me , Mr. Stukely is dishonest .


Char .
We know it , Jarvis .
But what 's your news ?


Jar .
That there 's an action against my master , at his friend 's suit .


Mrs. Bev .
O , villain !
villain !
't was this he threatened then .
Run to that den of robbers , Wilson 's -- Your master may be there .
Entreat him home , good Jarvis .
Say I have business with him -- But tell him not of Stukely -- It may provoke him to revenge -- Haste !
haste !
good Jarvis .
[ Exit Jarvis .


Char .
This minister of hell !
O , I could tear him piece-meal !


Mrs. Bev .
I am sick of such a world .
Yet heaven is just  and in its own good time , will hurl destruction on such monsters .
[ Exeunt .


SCENE III .
changes to STUKELY 'S lodgings .


Enter STUKELY , and BATES , meeting .


Bates .
Where have you been ?


Stu .
Fooling my time away : playing my tricks , like a tame monkey , to entertain a woman -- No matter where -- I have been vext and disappointed .
Tell me of Beverley .
How bore he his last shock ?


Bates .
Like one ( so Dawson says ) whose senses had been numbed by misery .
When all was lost , he fixed his eyes upon the ground , and stood some time , with folded arms , stupid and motionless .
Then snatching his sword , that hung against the wainscot , he sat him down  and with a look of fixt attention , drew figures on the floor .
At last he started up , looked wild , and trembled  and like a woman , seized with her sex 's fits , laughed out aloud , while the tears trickled down his face -- so left the room .


Stu .
Why , this was madness .


Bates .
The madness of despair .


Stu .
We must confine him then .
A prison would do well .
( A knocking at the door . )
Hark !
that knocking may be his .
Go that way down .
( Exit Bates . )
Who 's there ?


SCENE IV .


Enter LEWSON .


Lew .
An enemy .
An open and avowed one .


Stu .
Why am I thus broke in upon ?
This house is mine , Sir  and should protect me from insult and ill-manners .


Lew .
Guilt has no place of sanctuary  wherever found , 't is virtue 's lawful game .
The fox 's hold , and tyger 's den , are no security against the hunter .


Stu .
Your business , Sir ?


Lew .
To tell you that I know you -- Why this confusion ?
That look of guilt and terror ?
Is Beverley awake ?
Or has his wife told tales ?
The man that dares like You , should have a soul to justify his deeds , and courage to confront accusers .
Not with a coward 's fear to shrink beneath reproof .


Stu .
Who waits there ?
[ Aloud , and in confusion .


Lew .
By heaven , he dies that interrupts us .
( Shutting the door . )
You should have weighed your strength , Sir  and then , instead of climbing to high fortune , the world had marked you for what you are , a little paultry villain .


Stu .
You think I fear you .


Lew .
I know you fear me .
This is to prove it .
( Pulls him by the sleeve . )
You wanted privacy !
A lady 's presence took up your attention !
Now we are alone , Sir .
-- Why , what a wretch !
( Flings him from him . )
The vilest insect in creation will turn when trampled on  yet has this Thing undone a man -- by cunning and mean arts undone him .
But we have found you , Sir  traced you through all your labyrinths .
If you would save yourself , fall to confession : no mercy will be shewn else .


Stu .
First prove me what you think me .
Till then , your threatenings are in vain .
And for this insult , vengeance may yet be mine .


Lew .
Infamous coward !
Why , take it now then -- ( Draws , and Stukely retires . )
Alas !
I pity thee .
Yet that a wretch like this should overcome a Beverley !
it fills me with astonishment !
A wretch , so mean of soul , that even desperation can not animate him to look upon an enemy .
You should not thus have soared , Sir , unless , like others of your black profession , you had a sword to keep the fools in awe , your villainy has ruined .


Stu .
Villainy !
` Twere best to curb this licence of your tongue  for know , Sir , while there are laws , this outrage on my reputation will not be borne with .


Lew .
Laws !
Dar ` st Thou seek shelter from the laws ?
those laws , which thou and thy infernal crew live in the constant violation of ?
Talk ` st thou of reputation too ?
when under friendship 's sacred name , thou hast betrayed , robbed , and destroyed ?


Stu .
Ay , rail at gaming  't is a rich topic , and affords noble declamation .
Go , preach against it in the city : you 'll find a congregation in every tavern .
If they should laugh at you , fly to my lord , and sermonize it there : he 'll thank you and reform .


Lew .
And will example sanctify a vice ?
No , wretch  the custom of my lord , or of the Cit that apes him , can not excuse a breach of law , or make the gamester 's calling reputable .


Stu .
Rail on , I say .
But is this zeal for beggared Beverley ?
Is it for Him that I am treated thus ?
No  He and His might all have groaned in prison , had but the sister 's fortune escaped the wreck , to have rewarded the disinterested love of honest Mr. Lewson .


Lew .
How I detest thee for the thought !
But thou art lost to every human feeling .
Yet let me tell thee , and may it wring thy heart !
that though my friend is ruined by thy snares , thou hast unknowingly been kind to Me .


Stu .
Have I ?
It was indeed unknowingly .


Lew .
Thou hast assisted me in love  given me the merit that I wanted  since but for Thee , my Charlotte had not known 't was her dear self I sighed for , and not her fortune .


Stu .
Thank me , and take her then .


Lew .
And as a brother to poor Beverley , I will pursue the robber that has seized him , and snatch him from his gripe .


Stu .
Then know , imprudent man , he is within my gripe  and should my friendship for him be slandered once again , the hand that has supplied him , shall fall and crush him .


Lew .
Why , now there 's spirit in thee !
This is indeed to be a villain !
But I shall reach thee yet .
Fly where thou wilt , my vengeance shall pursue thee -- and Beverley shall yet be saved , be saved from thee , thou monster  nor owe his rescue to his wife 's dishonour .
[ Exit .


Stu .
( Pausing ) Then ruin has enclosed me .
Curse on my coward heart !
I would be bravely villainous  but 't is my nature to shrink at danger , and he has found me .
Yet fear brings caution , and That security .
More mischief must be done , to hide the past .
Look to yourself , officious Lewson -- there may be danger stirring -- How now , Bates ?


SCENE V .


Enter BATES .


Bates .
What is the matter ?
'T was Lewson , and not Beverley , that left you .
I heard him loud : you seem alarmed too .


Stu .
Ay , and with reason .
We are discovered .


Bates .
I feared as much , and therefore cautioned you  but You were peremptory .


Stu .
Thus fools talk ever  spending their idle breath on what is past  and trembling at the future .
We must be active .
Beverley , at worst , is but suspicious  but Lewson 's genius , and his hate to Me , will lay all open .
Means must be found to stop him .


Bates .
What means ?


Stu .
Dispatch him -- Nay , start not -- Desperate occasions call for desperate deeds .
We live but by his death .


Bates .
You can not mean it ?


Stu .
I do , by heaven .


Bates .
Good night then .
[ Going .


Stu .
Stay .
I must be heard , then answered .
Perhaps the motion was too sudden  and human nature starts at murder , though strong necessity compels it .
I have thought long of this  and my first feelings were like yours  a foolish conscience awed me , which soon I conquered .
The man that would undo me , nature cries out , undo .
Brutes know their foes by instinct  and where superior force is given , they use it for destruction .
Shall man do less ?
Lewson pursues us to our ruin  and shall we , with the means to crush him , fly from our hunter , or turn and tear him ?
'T is folly even to hesitate .


Bates .
He has obliged me , and I dare not .


Stu .
Why , live to shame then , to beggary and punishment .
You would be privy to the deed , yet want the soul to act it .
Nay more  had my designs been levelled at his fortune , you had stept in the foremost .
And what is life without its comforts ?
Those you would rob him of  and by a lingering death , add cruelty to murder .
Henceforth adieu to half-made villains -- there 's danger in them .
What you have got is your 's  keep it , and hide with it : I 'll deal my future bounty to those who merit it .


Bates .
What 's the reward ?


Stu .
Equal division of our gains .
I swear it , and will be just .


Bates .
Think of the means then .


Stu .
He 's gone to Beverley 's -- Wait for him in the street -- 't is a dark night , and fit for mischief .
A dagger would be useful .


Bates .
He sleeps no more .


Stu .
Consider the reward !
When the deed 's done , I have farther business with you .
Send Dawson to me .


Bates .
Think it already done -- and so farewel .
[ Exit .


Stu .
Why , farewel Lewson then  and farewel to my fears .
This night secures me .
I 'll wait the event within .
[ Exit .


SCENE VI .
changes to the street .
Stage darkened .


Enter BEVERLEY .


Bev .
How like an out-cast do I wander !
Loaded with every curse , that drives the soul to desperation !
The midnight robber , as he walks his rounds , sees by the glimmering lamp my frantic looks , and dreads to meet me .
Whither am I going ?
My home lies there  all that is dear on earth it holds too  yet are the gates of death more welcome to me .
I 'll enter it no more -- Who passes there ?
Tis Lewson .
He meets me in a gloomy hour  and memory tells me , he has been meddling with my fame .


SCENE VII .


Enter LEWSON .


Lew .
Beverley !
Well met .
I have been busy in your affairs .


Bev .
So I have heard , Sir  and now must thank you for ` t .


Lew .
To-morrow I may deserve your thanks .
Late as it is , I go to Bates .
Discoveries are making that an arch villain trembles at .


Bev .
Discoveries are made , Sir , that You shall tremble at .
Where is this boasted spirit ?
this high demeanour , that was to call me to account ?
You say I have wronged my sister -- Now say as much .
But first be ready for defence , as I am for resentment .
[ Draws .


Lew .
What mean you ?
I understand you not .


Bev .
The coward 's stale acquittance .
Who , when he spreads foul calumny abroad , and dreads just vengeance on him , cries out , what mean you , I understand you not .


Lew .
Coward , and calumny !
Whence are these words ?
But I forgive , and pity you .


Bev .
Your pity had been kinder to my fame .
But you have traduced it  told a vile story to the public ear , that I have wronged my sister .


Lew .
'T is false .
Shew me the man that dares accuse me .


Bev .
I thought you brave , and of a soul superior to low malice  but I have found you , and will have vengeance .
This is no place for argument .


Lew .
Nor shall it be for violence .
Imprudent man !
who in revenge for fancied injuries , would pierce the heart that loves him !
But honest friendship acts from itself , unmoved by slander , or ingratitude .
The life you thirst for , shall be employed to serve you .


Bev .
'T is thus you would compound then !
First do a wrong beyond forgiveness  and to redress it , load me with kindness unsolicited .
I 'll not receive it .
Your zeal is troublesbme .


Lew .
No matter .
It shall be useful .


Bev .
It will not be accepted .


Lew .
It must .
You know me not .


Bev .
Yes  for the slanderer of my fame : who under shew of friendship , arraigns me of injustice  buzzing in every ear foul breach of trust , and family dishonour .


Lew .
Have I done this ?
Who told you so ?


Bev .
The world .
'T is talked of everywhere .
It pleased you to add threats too : you were to call me to account -- Why , do it now then  I shall be proud of such an arbiter .


Lew .
Put up your sword , and know me better .
I never injured you .
The base suggestion comes from Stukely : I see him and his aims .


Bev .
What aims ?
I 'll not conceal it  't was Stukely that accused you .


Lew .
To rid him of an enemy : perhaps of two .
He fears discovery , and frames a tale of falsehood , to ground revenge and murder on .


Bev .
I must have proof of this .


Lew .
Wait till to-morrow then .


Bev .
I will .


Lew .
Good night .
I go to serve you .
Forget what 's past , as I do  and chear your family with smiles .
To-morrow may confirm them , and make all happy .
[ Exit .


Bev .
( Pausing ) How vile , and how absurd is man !
His boasted honour is but another name for pride  which easier bears the consciousness of guilt , than the world 's just reproofs .
But 't is the fashion of the times  and in defence of falsehood and false honour , men die martyrs .
I knew not that my nature was so bad .
[ Stands musing .


SCENE VIII .


Enter BATES , and JARVIS .


Jar .
This way the noise was -- and yonder 's my poor master .


Bates .
I heard him at high words with Lewson .
The cause I know not .


Jar .
I heard him too .
Misfortunes vex him .


Bates .
Go to him , and lead him home -- But he comes this way -- I 'll not be seen by him .
[ Exit .


Bev .
( Starting . )
What fellow 's that ?
( Seeing Jarvis ) .
Art thou a murderer , friend ?
Come , lead the way  I have a hand as mischievous as thine  a heart as desperate too -- Jarvis !
-- To bed , old man , the cold will chill thee .


Jar .
Why are you wandering at this late hour ?
-- Your sword drawn too !
-- For heav 'n' s sake sheath it , Sir  the sight distracts Me .


Bev .
Whose voice was that ?
[ Wildly .


Jar .
'T was mine , Sir .
Let me intreat you to give the sword to me .


Bev .
Ay , take it  quickly take it -- Perhaps I am not so curst , but heav'n may have sent thee at this moment to snatch me from perdition .


Jar .
Then I am blest .


Bev .
Continue so , and leave me .
My sorrows are contagious .
No one is blest that 's near me .


Jar .
I came to seek you , Sir .


Bev .
And now thou hast found me , leave me .
My thoughts are wild , and will not be disturbed .


Jar .
Such thoughts are best disturbed .


Bev .
I tell thee that they will not .
Who sent thee hither ?


Jar .
My weeping mistress .


Bev .
Am I so meek a husband then ?
that a commanding wife prescribes my hours , and sends to chide me for my absence ?


Tell her , I 'll not return .


Jar .
Those words would kill her .


Bev .
Kill her !
Would they not be kind then ?
But she shall live to curse me -- I have deserved it of her .
Does she not hate me , Jarvis ?


Jar .
Alas , Sir !
Forget your griefs , and let me lead you to her .
The streets are dangerous .


Bev .
Be wise , and leave me then .
The night 's black horrors are suited to my thoughts .
These stones shall be my resting-place .
( Lies down . )
Here shall my soul brood o'er its miseries  till with the fiends of hell , and guilty of the earth , I start and tremble at the morning 's light .


Jar .
For pity 's sake , Sir !
-- Upon my knees I beg you to quit this place , and these sad thoughts .
Let patience , not despair , possess you .
Rise , I beseech you .
There 's not a moment of your absence , that my poor mistress does not groan for .


Bev .
Have I undone her , and is she still so kind ?
( Starting up ) It is too much -- My brain ca n't hold it -- O , Jarvis !
Jarvis !
how desperate is that wretch 's state , which only death or madness can relieve !


Jar .
Appease his mind , good heaven !
and give him resignation !
Alas , Sir , could beings in the other world perceive the events of this , how would your parents ' blessed spirits grieve for you , even in heaven !
Let me conjure you by Their honoured memories  by the sweet innocence of your yet helpless child , and by the ceaseless sorrows of my poor mistress , to rouze your manhood , and struggle with these griefs .


Bev .
Thou virtuous , good old man !
thy tears and thy entreaties have reached my heart , through all its miseries .
O !
had I listened to Thy honest warnings , no earthly blessing had been wanting to me !
I was so happy , that even a wish for more than I possessed , was arrogant presumption .
But I have warred against the power that blest me , and now am sentenced to the hell I merit .


Jar .
Be but resigned , Sir , and happiness may yet be yours .


Bev .
Prithee be honest , and do not flatter misery .


Jar .
I do not , Sir -- Hark !
I hear voices -- Come this way  we may reach home un-noticed .


Bev .
Well , lead me then -- Un-noticed did ` st thou say ?
Alas !
I dread no looks , but of those wretches I have made at home .
[ Exeunt .


SCENE IX .
changes to STUKELY 'S .


Enter STUKELY , and DAWSON .


Stu .
Come hither , Dawson .
My limbs are on the rack , and my soul shivers in me , till this night 's business be complete .
Tell me thy thoughts : is Bates determined ?
or does he waver ?


Daw .
At first he seemed irresolute  wished the employment had been mine  and muttered curses on his coward hand , that trembled at the deed .


Stu .
And did he leave you so ?


Daw .
No .
We walked together  and sheltered by the darkness , saw Beverley and Lewson in warm debate .
But soon they cooled  and then I left them , to hasten hither  but not till 't was resolved Lewson should die .


Stu .
Thy words have given me life .
That quarrel too was fortunate  for if my hopes deceive me not , it promises a grave to Beverley .


Daw .
You misconceive me .
Lewson and he were friends .


Stu .
But My prolific brain shall make them enemies .
If Lewson falls , he falls by Beverley : an upright jury shall decree it .
Ask me no questions , but do as I direct .
This writ ( Takes out a pocket book ) for some days past , I have treasured here , till a convenient time called for its use .
That time is come .
Take it , and give it to an officer .
It must be served this instant .
[ Gives a paper .


Daw .
On Beverley ?


Stu .
Look at it .
'T is for the sums that I have lent him .


Daw .
Must he to prison then ?


Stu .
I asked obedience  not replies .
This night a jail must be his lodging .
'T is probable he 's not gone home yet .
Wait at his door , and see it executed .


Daw .
Upon a beggar ?
He has no means of payment .


Stu .
Dull and insensible !
If Lewson dies , who was it killed him ?
Why , he that was seen quarrelling with him  and I that knew of Beverley 's intents , arrested him in friendship -- A little late , perhaps  but 't was a virtuous act , and men will thank me for it .
Now , Sir , you understand me ?


Daw .
Most perfectly  and will about it .


Stu .
Haste then  and when 't is done , come back and tell me .


Daw .
'Till then farewel .
[ Exit .


Stu .
Now tell thy tale , fond wife !
And , Lewson , if again thou can ` st insult me , I 'll kneel and own thee for my master .


Not av ` rice now , but vengeance fires my breast And one short hour must make me curst , or blest .


[ Exit .


ACT V .


SCENE I. Enter STUKELY , BATES , and DAWSON .


Bates .
Poor Lewson !
But I told you enough last night .
The thoughts of him are horrible to me .


Stu .
In the street , did you say ?
And no one near him ?


Bates .
By his own door  he was leading me to his house .
I pretended business with him , and stabbed him to the heart , while he was reaching at the bell .


Stu .
And did he fall so suddenly ?


Bates .
The repetition pleases you , I see .
I told you , he fell without a groan .


Stu .
What heard you of him this morning ?


Bates .
That the watch found him in their rounds , and alarmed the servants .
I mingled with the crowd just now , and saw him dead in his own house .
The sight terrified me .


Stu .
Away with terrors , till his ghost rise and accuse us .
We have no living enemy to fear -- unless 't is Beverley  and him we have lodged safe in prison .


Bates .
Must He be murdered too ?


Stu .
No  I have a scheme to make the law his murderer .
At what hour did Lewson fall ?


Bates .
The clock struck twelve , just as I turned to leave him .
'T was a melancholy bell , I thought , tolling for his death .


Stu .
The time was lucky for us .
Beverley was arrested at one , you say ?
[ To Dawson .


Daw .
Exactly .


Stu .
Good .
We 'll talk of this presently .
The women were with him , I think ?


Daw .
And old Jarvis .
I would have told you of them last night , but your thoughts were too busy .
'T is well you have a heart of stone , the tale would melt it else .


Stu .
Out with it then .


Daw .
I traced him to his lodgings  and pretending pity for his misfortunes , kept the door open , while the officers seized him .
'T was a damned deed -- but no matter -- I followed my instructions .


Stu .
And what said he ?


Daw .
He upbraided me with treachery , called You a villain , acknowledged the sums you had lent him , and submitted to his fortune .


Stu .
And the women --


Daw .
For a few minutes astonishment kept them silent .
They looked wildly at one another , while the tears streamed down their cheeks .
But rage and fury soon gave them words  and then , in the very bitterness of despair , they cursed me , and the monster that had employed me .


Stu .
And you bore it with philosophy ?


Daw .
Till the scene changed , and then I melted .
I ordered the officers to take away their prisoner .
The women shrieked , and would have followed him  but We forbad them .
'T was then they fell upon their knees , the wife fainting , the sister raving , and both , with all the eloquence of misery , endeavouring to soften us .
I never felt compassion till that moment  and had the officers been moved like Me , we had left the business undone , and fled with curses on ourselves .
But their hearts were steeled by custom : the tears of beauty , and the pangs of affection , were beneath their pity .
They tore him from their arms , and lodged him in prison , with only Jarvis to comfort him .


Stu .
There let him lie , till we have farther business with him .
And for You , Sir , let me hear no more of your compassion .
A fellow nursed in villainy , and employed from childhood in the business of hell , should have no dealings with compassion .


Daw .
Say you so , Sir ?
You should have named the devil that tempted me .


Stu .
'T is false .
I found you a villain  therefore employed you -- But no more of this -- We have embarked too far in mischief to recede .
Lewson is dead  and we are all principals in his murder .
Think of that .
There 's time enough for pity , when ourselves are out of danger .
Beverley still lives , though in a jail .
His ruin will sit heavy on him  and discoveries may be made to undo us all .
Something must be done , and speedily .
You saw him quarrelling with Lewson in the street last night ?
[ To Bates .


Bates .
I did  his steward , Jarvis , saw him too .


Stu .
And shall attest it .
Here 's matter to work upon .
An unwilling evidence carries weight with him .
Something of my design I have hinted t ` you before .
Beverley must be the author of this murder  and We the parties to convict him .
But how to proceed , will require time and thought -- Come along with Me  the room within is fitter for privacy .
But no compassion , Sir -- ( To Dawson ) We want leisure for ` t -- This way .
[ Exeunt .


SCENE II .
changes to BEVERLEY 'S lodgings .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , and CHARLOTTE .


Mrs. Bev .
No news of Lewson yet ?


Char .
None .
He went out early , and knows not what has happened .


Mrs. Bev .
The clock strikes eight -- I 'll wait no longer .


Char .
Stay but till Jarvis comes .
He has sent twice to stop us till we see him .


Mrs. Bev .
I have no life in this separation .
O !
what a night was last night !
I would not pass another such , to purchase worlds by it .
My poor Beverley too !
What must He have felt !
-- The very thought distracts me !
To have him torn at midnight from me !
A loathsome prison his habitation !
A cold damp room his lodging !
The bleak winds , perhaps , blowing upon his pillow !
No fond wife to lull him to his rest !
and no reflections but to wound and tear him !
-- 'T is too horrible !
I wanted love for him , or they had not forced him from me .
They should have parted soul and body first .
I was too tame .


Char .
You must not talk so .
All that we could we did  and Jarvis did the rest .
The faithful creature will give him comfort .
Why does he delay coming ?


Mrs. Bev .
And there 's another fear .
His poor master may be claiming the last kind office from him -- His heart perhaps is breaking .


Char .
See where he comes !
-- His looks are chearful too .


SCENE III .


Enter JARVIS .


Mrs. Bev .
Are tears then chearful ?
Alas , he weeps !
Speak to him Charlotte : I have no tongue to ask him questions .


Char .
How does your master , Jarvis ?


Jar .
I am old and foolish , madam  and tears will come before my words -- But do n't You weep .
( To Mrs. Beverley . )
I have a tale of joy for you .


Mrs. Bev .
What tale ?
Say but he 's well , and I have joy enough .


Jar .
His mind too shall be well  all shalt be well -- I have news for him that shall make his poor heart bound again !
-- Fie upon old age !
how childish it makes me !
I have a tale of joy for you , and my tears drown it .


Char .
Shed them in showers then , and make haste to tell it .


Mrs. Bev .
What is it , Jarvis ?


Jar .
Yet why should I rejoice when a good man dies ?
Your uncle , madam , died yesterday .


Mrs. Bev .
My uncle !
-- O heavens !


Char .
How heard you of his death ?


Jar .
His steward came express , madam : I met him in the street , enquiring for your lodgings .
I should not rejoice , perhaps  but he was old , and my poor master a prisoner -- Now he shall live again -- O , 't is a brave fortune !
and 't was death to me to see him a prisoner .


Char .
Where left you the steward ?


Jar .
I would not bring him hither , to be a witness of your distresses -- and besides , I wanted once before I die , to be the messenger of joy t ` you .
My good master will be a man again .


Mrs. Bev .
Haste , haste then  and let us fly to him !
-- We are delaying our own happiness .


Jar .
I had forgot a coach , madam  and Lucy has ordered one .


Mrs. Bev .
Where was the need of that ?
The news has given me wings .


Char .
I have no joy , till my poor brother shares it with me .
How did he pass the night , Jarvis ?


Jar .
Why now , madam , I can tell you .
Like a man dreaming of death and horrors .
When they led him to his cell -- for 't was a poor apartment for my master -- he flung himself upon a wretched bed , and lay speechless till day-break .
A sigh now and then , and a few tears that followed those sighs , were all that told me he was alive .
I spoke to him , but he would not hear me  and when I persisted , he raised his hand at me , and knit his brow so -- I thought he would have struck me .


Mrs. Bev .
O miserable !
But what said he , Jarvis ?
Or was he silent all night ?


Jar .
At day-break he started from the bed , and looking wildly at me , asked who I was .
I told him , and bid him be of comfort -- Begone , old wretch , says he -- I have sworn never to know comfort -- My wife !
my child !
my sister !
I have undone them all , and will know no comfort -- Then letting go his hold , and falling upon his knees , he imprecated curses on himself .


Mrs. Bev .
This is too horrible !
-- But you did not leave him so ?


Char .
No , I am sure he did not .


Jar .
I had not the heart , madam .
By degrees I brought him to himself .
A shower of tears came to his relief  and then he called me his kindest friend , and begged forgiveness of me like a child -- I was a child too , when he begged forgiveness of me  my heart throbbed so , I could not speak to him .
He turned from me for a minute or two , and suppressing a few bitter sighs , enquired after his wretched family -- Wretched was his word , madam -- Asked how you bore the misery of last night -- If you had goodness enough to see him in prison -- And then begged me to hasten to you .
I told him he must be more himself first -- He promised me he would  and , bating a few sullen intervals , he became composed and easy .
And then I left him  but not without an attendant  a servant in the prison , whom I hired to wait upon him .
'T is an hour since we parted : I was prevented in my haste , to be the messenger of joy t ` you .


Mrs. Bev .
What a tale is this ?
-- But we have staid too long -- A coach is needless .


Char .
Hark !
I hear one at the door .


Jar .
And Lucy comes to tell us -- We 'll away this moment .


Mrs. Bev .
To comfort him , or die with him .
[ Exeunt .


SCENE IV .
changes to STUKELY 's lodgings .


Enter STUKELY , BATES , and DAWSON .


Stu .
Here 's presumptive evidence at least : or if we want more , why , we must swear more .
But all unwillingly : we gain credit by reluctance .
I have told you how to proceed .
Beverley must die .
We hunt him in view now , and must not slacken in the chace .
'T is either death for Him , or shame and punishment for Us .
Think of that , and remember your instructions .
You , Bates , must to the prison immediately : I would be there but a few minutes before you .
And you , Dawson , must follow in a few minutes after .
So here we divide -- But answer me  are you resolved upon this business like men ?


Bates .
Like villains rather -- But you may depend upon us .


Stu .
Like what we are then -- You make no answer , Dawson -- Compassion , I suppose , has seized you .


Daw .
No  I have disclaimed it .
My answer is Bates 's -- You may depend upon me .


Stu .
Consider the reward !
Riches and security !
I have sworn to divide with you to the last shilling .
So here we separate , till we meet in prison .
Remember your instructions , and be men .
[ Exeunt .


SCENE V. changes to a prison .


BEVERLEY is discovered sitting .
After a short pause , he starts up , and comes forward .


Bev .
Why , there 's an end then .
I have judged deliberately , and the result is death .
How the self-murderer 's account may stand , I know not .
But this I know  the load of hateful life oppresses me too much .
The horrors of my soul are more than I can bear -- ( Offers to kneel ) Father of mercy !
-- I can not pray -- Despair has laid his iron hand upon me , and sealed me for perdition -- Conscience !
conscience !
thy clamours are too loud -- Here 's that shall silence them .
( Takes a vial out of his pocket , and looks at it . )
Thou art most friendly to the miserable .
Come then , thou cordial for sick minds !
come to my heart !
( Drinks ) O , that the grave would bury memory as well as body !
For if the soul sees and feels the sufferings of those dear ones it leaves behind , the EVERLASTING has no vengeance to torment it deeper -- I 'll think no more o n't -- Reflection comes too late .
Once there was a time for ` t -- but now 't is past -- Who 's there ?


SCENE VI .


Enter JARVIS .


Jar .
One that hoped to see you with better looks .
Why do you turn so from me ?
I have brought comfort with me -- And see who comes to give it welcome !


Bev .
My wife and sister !
Why , 't is but one pang more then , and farewel world .
[ Aside .


SCENE VII .


Enter Mrs. BEVERLEY , and CHARLOTTE .


Mrs. Bev .
Where is he ?
( Runs and embraces him ) O , I have him !
I have him !
And now they shall never part us more !
I have news , love , to make you happy for ever -- but do n't look coldly on me .


Char .
How is it , brother ?


Mrs. Bev .
Alas !
he hears us not .
Speak to me , love .
I have no heart to see you thus .


Bev .
Nor I to bear the sense of so much shame .
This is a sad place .


Mrs. Bev .
We come to take you from it  to tell you that the world goes well again  that providence has seen our sorrows , and sent the means to heal them -- Your uncle died yesterday .


Bev .
My uncle !
-- No , do not say so -- O !
I am sick at heart !


Mrs. Bev .
Indeed !
-- I meant to bring you comfort .
Bev .
Tell me he lives then -- If you would give me comfort , tell me he lives .


Mrs. Bev .
And if I did , I have no power to raise the dead .
He died yesterday .


Bev .
And I am heir to him ?


Jar .
To his whole estate , Sir -- But bear it patiently .


Bev .
Well , well -- ( Pausing ) Why , fame says I am rich then ?


Mrs. Bev .
And truly so -- Why do you look so wildly ?


Bev .
Do I ?
The news was unexpected .
But has he left me all ?


Jar .
All , all , Sir -- He could not leave it from you .


Bev .
I 'm sorry for it .


Char .
Sorry !
Why sorry ?


Bev .
Your uncle 's dead , Charlotte .


Char .
Peace be with his soul then .
Is it so terrible that an old man should die ?


Bev .
He should have been immortal .


Mrs. Bev .
Heaven knows I wished not for his death .
'T was the will of providence that he should die .
Why are you disturbed so ?


Bev .
Has death no terrors in it ?


Mrs. Bev .
Not an old man 's death .
Yet if it troubles you , I wish him living .


Bev .
And I , with all my heart .


Char .
Why , what 's the matter ?


Bev .
Nothing .
How heard you of his death ?


Mrs. Bev .
His steward came express .
Would I had never known it !


Bev .
Or had heard it one day sooner -- For I have a tale to tell , shall turn you into stone  or if the power of speech , remain , you shall kneel down and curse me .


Mrs. Bev .
Alas !
what tale is this ?
And why are we to curse you ?
I 'll bless you for ever .


Bev .
No  I have deserved no blessings .
The world holds not such another wretch .
All this large fortune , this second bounty of heaven , that might have healed our sorrows , and satisfied our utmost hopes , in a curst hour I sold last night .


Char .
Sold !
How sold ?


Mrs. Bev .
Impossible !
It can not be !


Bev .
That devil Stukely , with all hell to aid him , tempted me to the deed .
To pay false debts of honour , and to redeem past errors , I sold the reversion -- sold it for a scanty sum , and lost it among villains .


Char .
Why , farewel all then .


Bev .
Liberty and life .
Come , kneel and curse me .


Mrs. Bev .
Then hear me heaven !
( Kneels ) Look down with mercy on his sorrows !
Give softness to his looks , and quiet to his heart !
Take from his memory the sense of what is past , and cure him of despair !
On Me , on Me , if misery must be the lot of either , multiply misfortunes !
I 'll bear them patiently , so He is happy !
These hands shall toil for his support !
These eyes be lifted up for hourly blessings on him !
And every duty of a fond and faithful wife , be doubly done to chear and comfort him !
-- So hear me !
so reward me !
[ Rises .


Bev .
I would kneel too , but that offended heaven would turn my prayers to curses .
What have I to ask for ?
I , who have shook hands with hope ?
Is it for length of days that I should kneel ?
No  My time is limited .
Or is it for this world 's blessings upon You and Yours ?
To pour out my heart in wishes for a ruined wife , a child and sister ?
O !
no !
For I have done a deed to make you miserable .


Mrs. Bev .
Why miserable ?
Is poverty so miserable ?
-- The real wants of life are few : a little industry will supply them all  and chearfulness will follow .
It is the privilege of honest industry  and we 'll enjoy it fully .


Bev .
Never , never !
O , I have told you but in part .
The irrevocable deed is done .


Mrs. Bev .
What deed ?
And why do you look so at me ?


Bev .
A deed , that dooms my soul to vengeance  that seals Your misery here , and Mine hereafter .


Mrs. Bev .
No , no  You have a heart too good for ` t -- Alas !
he raves , Charlotte -- his looks too terrify me -- Speak comfort to him -- He can have done no deed of wickedness .


Char .
And yet I fear the worst .
What is it , brother ?


Bev .
A deed of horror .


Jar .
Ask him no questions , madam .
This last misfortune has hurt his brain .
A little time will give him patience .


SCENE VIII .


Enter STUKELY .


Bev .
Why is this villain here ?


Stu .
To give You liberty and safety .
There 's his discharge , madam .
( Giving a paper to Mrs. Beverley ) Let him begone this moment .
The arrest last night was meant in friendship  but came too late .


Char .
What mean you , Sir ?


Stu .
The arrest was too late , I say .
I would have kept his hands from blood , but was too late .


Mrs. Bev .
His hands from blood !
Whose blood ?
-- O , wretch !
wretch !


Stu .
From Lewson 's blood .


Char .
No , villain !
Yet what of Lewson ?
Speak quickly !


Stu .
You are ignorant then !
I thought I heard the murderer at confession .


Char .
What murderer ?
And who is murdered ?
Not Lewson ?
Say he lives , and I 'll kneel down and worship you .


Stu .
In pity , so I would  but that the tongues of all cry murder .
I came in pity , not in malice  to save the brother , not kill the sister .
Your Lewson 's dead .


Char .
O horrible !
Why , who has killed him ?
-- And yet it can not be .
What crime had He committed that he should die ?
Villain !
he lives !
he lives !
and shall revenge these pangs .


Mrs. Bev .
Patience , sweet Charlotte !


Char .
O , 't is too much for patience !


Mrs. Bev .
He comes in pity , he says .
O !
execrable villain !
The friend is killed then , and this the murderer ?


Bev .
Silence , I charge you .
Proceed , Sir .


Stu .
No .
Justice may stop the tale -- and here 's an evidence .


SCENE IX .


Enter BATES .


Bates .
The news , I see , has reached you .
But take comfort , madam .
( To Charlotte ) There 's one without , enquiring for you .
Go to him , and lose no time .


Char .
O misery !
misery !
[ Exit .


Mrs. Bev .
Follow her , Jarvis .
If it be true that Lewson 's dead , her grief may kill her .


Bates .
Jarvis must stay here , madam : I have some questions for him .


Stu .
Rather let him fly .
His evidence may crush his master .


Bev .
Why , ay  this looks like management .


Bates .
He found you quarrelling with Lewson in the street last night .
[ To Beverley .


Mrs. Bev .
No  I am sure he did not .


Jar .
Or if I did --


Mrs. Bev .
'T is false , old man -- They had no quarrel  there was no cause for quarrel .


Bev .
Let him proceed , I say -- O !
I am sick !
sick !
Reach me a chair .
[ He sits down .


Mrs. Bev .
You droop , and tremble , love -- Your eyes are fixt too -- Yet You are innocent .
If Lewson 's dead , You killed him not .


SCENE X .


Enter DAWSON .


Stu .
Who sent for Dawson ?


Bates .
'T was I .
We have a witness too , you little think of .
Without there !


Stu .
What witness ?


Bates .
A right one .
Look at him .


SCENE XI .


Re-enter CHARLOTTE , with LEWSON .


Stu .
Lewson !
O -- villains !
villains !
[ To Bates and Dawson .


Mrs. Bev .
Risen from the dead !
Why , this is unexpected happiness !


Char .
Or is 't his ghost ?
( To Stukely ) That sight would please you , Sir .


Jar .
What riddle 's this ?


Bev .
Be quick and tell it -- My minutes are but few .


Mrs. Bev .
Alas !
why so ?
You shall live long and happily .


Lew .
While shame and punishment shall rack that viper .
( Pointing to Stukely ) The tale is short .
I was too busy in his secrets , and therefore doomed to die .
Bates , to prevent the murder , undertook it .
I kept aloof to give it credit --


Char .
And gave Me pangs unutterable .


Lew .
I felt them all , and would have told you  but vengeance wanted ripening .
The villain 's scheme was but half executed .
The arrest by Dawson followed the supposed murder : and now , depending on his once wicked associates , he comes to fix the guilt on Beverley .


Mrs. Bev .
O !
execrable wretch !


Bates .
Dawson and I are witnesses of this .


Lew .
And of a thousand frauds .
His friend undone by sharpers and false dice  and Stukely sole contriver , and possessor of all .


Daw .
Had he but stopt on this side murder , we had been villains still .


Mrs. Bev .
Thus heaven turns evil into good  and by permitting sin , warns men to virtue .


Lew .
Yet punishes the instrument .
So shall our laws  though not with death .
But death were mercy .
Shame , beggary , and imprisonment , unpitied misery , the stings of conscience , and the curses of mankind shall make life hateful to him -- till at last , his own hand end him .
How does my friend ?
[ To Beverley .


Bev .
Why , well .
Who 's he that asks me ?


Mrs. Bev .
Tis Lewson , love .
Why do you look so at him ?


Bev .
They told me he was murdered .
[ Wildly .


Mrs. Bev .
Ay  but he lives to save us .


Bev .
Lend me your hand -- The room turns round .


Mrs. Bev .
O heaven !


Lew .
This villain here , disturbs him .
Remove him from his sight : and for your lives , see that you guard him .
( Stukely is taken off by Dawson and Bates ) How is it , Sir ?


Bev .
'T is here -- and here -- ( Pointing to his head and heart . )
And now it tears me !


Mrs. Bev .
You feel convulsed too -- What is 't disturbs you ?


Lew .
This sudden turn of joy perhaps .
He wants rest too .
Last night was dreadful to him .
His brain is giddy .


Char .
Ay , never to be cured .
Why , brother !
-- O !
I fear !
I fear !


Mrs. Bev .
Preserve him , heaven !
-- My love !
my life !
look at me !
-- How his eyes flame !


Bev .
A furnace rages in this heart -- I have been too hasty .


Mrs. Bev .
Indeed !
-- O me !
O me !
-- Help , Jarvis !
Fly , fly for help !
Your master dies else -- Weep not , but fly !
( Exit Jarvis ) What is this hasty deed ?
-- Yet do not answer me -- My fears have guessed it .


Bev .
Call back the messenger .
'T is not in medicine 's power to help me .


Mrs. Bev .
Is it then so ?


Bev .
Down , restless flames !
-- ( Laying his hand on his heart ) down to your native hell !
-- there you shall rack me -- O !
for a pause from pain !


Mrs. Bev .
Help , Charlotte !
Support him , Sir !
( To Lewson )


Bev .
What river 's this ?
I 'll plunge , and cool me !
( Flings himself upon the ground . )
O !
't is a sea of fire !
-- Lift me !
lift me !
[ They raise him to his chair .


Mrs. Bev .
This is a killing fight !


Bev .
( Starting ) That pang was well .
It has numbed my senses .
Where 's my wife ?
Can you forgive me , love ?


Mrs. Bev .
Alas !
for what ?


Bev .
( Starting again ) And there 's another pang -- Now all is quiet .
Will you forgive me ?


Mrs. Bev .
I will .
Tell me for what ?


Bev .
For meanly dying .


Mrs. Bev .
No -- do not say it .


Bev .
As truly as my soul must answer it .
Had Jarvis staid this morning , all had been well .
But pressed by shame  pent in a prison  tormented with my pangs for You  driven to despair and madness  I took the advantage of his absence , corrupted the poor wretch he left to guard me , and -- swallowed poison .


Mrs. Bev .
O !
fatal deed !


Char .
Dreadful and cruel !


Bev .
Ay , most accursed -- And now I go to my account .
This rest from pain brings death  yet 't is heaven 's kindness to me .
I wished for ease , a moment 's ease , that cool repentance and contrition might soften vengeance .
Bend me , and let me kneel .
( They lift him from his chair , and support him on his knees ) I 'll pray for You too .
Thou Power that mad ` st me , hear me !
If for a life of frailty , and this too hasty deed of death , thy justice dooms me , here I acquit the sentence .
But if , enthroned in mercy where thou sitt ` st , thy pity has beheld me , send me a gleam of hope  that in these last and bitter moments , my soul may taste of comfort !
And for these mourners here , O !
let their lives be peaceful , and their deaths happy !
Now raise me .
[ They lift him to the chair .


Mrs. Bev .
Restore him , heaven !
Stretch forth thy arm omnipotent , and snatch him from the grave !
O save him !
save him !


Bev .
Alas !
that prayer is fruitless : already death has seized me .
Yet heaven is gracious .
I asked for hope , as the bright presage of forgiveness , and like a light , blazing through darkness , it came and cheared me .
'T was all I lived for , and now I die .


Mrs. Bev .
Not yet !
-- Not yet !
-- Stay but a little , and I 'll die too .


Bev .
No  live , I charge you .
We have a little one : though I have left him , You will not leave him .
To Lewson 's kindness I bequeath him -- Is not this Charlotte ?
We have lived in love , though I have wronged you -- Can you forgive me , Charlotte ?


Char .
Forgive you !
-- O , my poor brother !


Bev .
Lend me your hand , love .
So -- raise me -- No -- ` twill not be -- my life is finished -- O !
for a few short moments to tell you how my heart bleeds for you !
-- That even now , thus dying as I am , dubious and fearful of hereafter , my bosom pang is for Your miseries !
-- Support her heaven !
-- And now I go -- O , mercy !
mercy !
[ Dies .


Lew .
Then all is over -- How is it , madam ?
( To Mrs. Beverley . )
My poor Charlotte too !


SCENE the last .


Enter JARVIS .


Jar .
How does my master , madam ?
Here 's help at hand -- Am I too late then ?
[ Seeing Beverley .


Char .
Tears !
tears !
why fall you not ?
O wretched sister !
-- Speak to her , Lewson -- her grief is speechless .


Lew .
Remove her from this sight .
Go to her , Jarvis  lead and support her .
Sorrow like hers forbids complaint .
Words are for lighter griefs .
Some ministring angel bring her peace !
( Jarvis and Charlotte lead her off . )
And Thou , poor breathless corps , may thy departed soul have found the rest it prayed for !
Save but one error , and this last fatal deed , thy life was lovely .
Let frailer minds take warning  and from example learn , that want of prudence is want of virtue .


Follies , if uncontroul'd , of every kind , Grow into passions , and subdue the mind  With sense and reason hold superior strife , And conquer honour , nature , fame and life .


EPILOGUE .


Written by a FRIEND ,


And Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD .


On every GAMESTER in th ' Arabian nation , 'T is said , that Mahomet denounc'd damnation  But in return for wicked cards and dice , He gave them black-ey'd girls in paradise .
Should he thus preach , good countrymen , to You , His converts would , I fear , be mighty few : So much your hearts are set on sordid gain , The brightest eyes around you shine in vain : Should the most heav ` nly beauty bid you take her , You 'd rather hold -- two aces and a maker .
By your example , our poor sex drawn in , Is guilty of the same unnat ` ral sin : The study now of every girl of parts Is how to win your money , not your hearts .
O !
in what sweet , what ravishing delights , Our beaux and belles together pass their nights !
By ardent perturbations kept awake , Each views with longing eyes the other 's -- stake .
The smiles and graces are from Britain flown , Our Cupid is an errant sharper grown , And Fortune sits on Cytherea 's throne .
In all these things , though women may be blam'd , Sure men , the wiser men , should be asham'd !
And 't is a horrid scandal , I declare , That four strange queens should rival all the fair  Four jilts , with neither beauty , wit nor parts , O shame !
have got possession of their hearts  And those bold sluts , for all their queenly pride , Have play'd loose tricks , or else they 're much bely'd .
Cards were at first for benefits design'd , Sent to amuse , and not enslave the mind : From good to bad how easy the transition !
For what was pleasure once , is now perdition .
Fair ladies , then these wicked GAMESTERS shun , Whoever weds one , is , you see , undone .
