PREFACE .


 SINCE the first publication of the late Earl of CHESTERFIELD 'S Letters , to the present time , the arrows of Censure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate , from every quarter : the wit hath had his joke , the versifier his parody , the moralist his opposing sentiment , and the divine  his grave dissertation .
Very ingenious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his Lordship : his Graces have been smartly ridiculed  his etiquette humorously exposed  and Mr. HUNTER , with an elegance and profundity far beyond the rest of his remarkers , hath penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims , traversed him through every double , and examined his whole system with an analytical acuteness .


It is matter of real amazement that amongst all those who have expressed themselves loudly and diametrically against the doctrine of  Lord CHESTERFIELD 'S correspondence , none should have yet thought of the only method that was most likely to manifest their tendency .
The general stigma upon these Letters has been , that they are calculated to recommend deceit , and to conceal the most destructive hypocrisy , under the smiling aspect , plausible exterior , fair-seeming sentiments , and a complacent flexibility .


In an age of voluptuousness , it is most obvious to apprehension , that maxims , like these , would have most weight with the young and dissipated .
The man of fashion  would find them so consistent with his plan of security , that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them  and the man of expedient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which , without either danger of his neck , or character , might repair his purse , promote his pleasures , and save him from a thousand shocks that poverty is heir to .


The essence of my Lord CHESTERFIELD 'S system seems to be neither more nor less than this : Secure yourself from being blasted , as he terms it , and do whatever  you think proper : whatever fancy , passion , whim , or wickedness , suggest , only command your countenance , check your temper , and throw before your heart and bosom the shield of Dissimulation , and snatch it - seize it - enjoy it .


In regard to women - never surely issued from the press a collection of hints so capable of being turned to their destruction : and the sex ought to be more alarmed at this publication ( which , however , one of their own sex has ushered into the world ) than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind , or purity of character .


 How , then , hath it happened , that no person hath yet put the volumes of the Earl of CHESTERFIELD into the hand of a hero , who , with a natural aptitude to enjoy every thing within his observation , might increase his felicity very considerably , by the assistance of sentiments so admirably suited to multiply mischief , and to ensure his victory over that simplicity , that beauty , and that softness , which , would , thence , be , so much the more easily , thrown off their guard .


As nothing of this kind , however , has appeared , I have ventured  to present to the public , the adventures of a man of birth , rank , figure , and character , ardent in the pursuit of pleasures , and much delighted with , and attracted by , the theory of Lord CHESTERFIELD .
He purchases the books , finds them agreeable to his palate , studies them paragraph by paragraph , thrives under his application , piques himself upon his progress  and in the end , a master of his science , invokes the genius of his noble preceptor , puts money in his purse , the inestimable volumes in his portmanteau , and sallies into the gay world , armed at all points , the PUPIL OF PLEASURE .


 Every ingenious precept laid down by the noble Lord , this high-bred young gentleman reduces to practice , who , taking the summer before him , makes his attacks at a place of fashionable resort  where ( fixing with commendable and pre-instructed acuteness upon proper objects ) he begins to exemplify , and is as successful as the politest casuist could possibly wish .


In the course of this historical illustration - this biographical commentary on the text of CHESTERFIELD - ample scope has been allowed for the display of various characters , and particularly such as  more immediately promoted the main design of the work , which is , to shew the aggravated evils in society arising from the practice of such perniciously-pleasing precepts .


To this end , I have made great use of the noble Lord 's maxims , rules , and admonitions , upon various subjects .
The incidents , it is conceived , arise , naturally , out of the principles that produce them  the contrast in the characters , especially of HOMESPUN , SEDLEY , THORNTON , Lieutenant VERNON , and Sir HENRY DELMORE , I have endeavoured to render eminent and  conspicuous  and altho ' , some may think , the catastrophe and a few of the circumstances , carried too far into the pathetic , yet , I am persuaded , those who weigh deeply the precepts of Lord CHESTERFIELD , will agree with me in thinking , that , if pushed into practice by an adventurer , like that which his Lordship would have formed out of Mr. STANHOPE , similar or even greater sorrows , and vices , would invade the community .
In short , this history is calculated strongly to prove the truth of Lord CHESTERFIELD 'S own observation , namely , `` That the adoption of Vice is  likely to ruin ten times more young men , than natural inclination . ''


I am apt to think Mr. STANHOPE 'S reputed want of ability made him die an honest , though an undistinguished man : perhaps , if he had had Ton enough to follow the advice of his father , and entered into all the elevated connexions recommended to him , he had fallen , like the hero of this history , equally celebrated , dazzling , and diabolical .


 THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE , c..


Buxton .


THE whirl of wheels , a fine flow of spirits , the elysium of expectation , and the vigour of fresh horses at every stage , brought me , in less than twenty hours , from Cavendish-square to the place of date .
Having no unnecessary luggage  to retard me , no trifling petit maitre , who , at two miles distance from the shifting-place , drives back for his gloves , his cane , his snuff-box , or his white handkerchief  I rolled , THORNTON , on the springs of expedition  and I sit down , unsubdued by fatigue , to tell thee of my safety .


Richardson 's a child , his Grandison is a monster , his Lovelace a bungler : - since the days of Adam , Nature hath produced but one man of pleasure  and that wonder was reserved to adorn the age before us .


Oh , CHESTERFIELD !
CHESTERFIELD !
thou , only thou , knewest the science of joy  thou only hadst the skill to cover the ruggednesses of life with roses , that bloom from being pressed .
Deign then , immortal shade !
to look with a gentle eye upon thy pupil  teach me to emulate  thy genius , to practise thy precepts , to hit , with a felicity like thine , the true spirit of dissimulation - soften my features to the blandishments of delight - attune my tongue to the thrillings of persuasion - enrich my sentiments with so versatile a ductility , that I may obey the occasions of the minute - endue me with perseverance of soul , and condescend to guide me ( with all thy attendant graces  assiduities , and elegant attentions , ) into the bosom of voluptuousness , my Friend , my Mentor , my Genius , and my God !


THORNTON , I am inspired !
the rhapsody of my invocation is throbbing already at my heart - it is working its way to the very marrow in the bones .
The divine Letters of our Earl are this instant brought in by the postilion , who is unconscious of the treasure with which he is freighted  and I dare not proceed till I  have unlocked my hoard , and , with a more than Persian prostration , paid to the maxims by which I am to be conducted the incense of my idolatry .


Adieu , adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 TAKE care : it is easier to advise than to act .
I wish you joy of your system , which I approve : let it not , however , appear to be imitation  and the deities of bliss throw objects in your way !


Farewel .
JAMES THORNTON .


P. S. Be explicit in your letters .


 DULL THORNTON !
- circumspect citizen !
at what art thou alarmed , and `` why is thy spirit troubled within thee ? ''
How canst thou entertain so contemptible a notion of thy SEDLEY ?
Imitation !
Curse thee for the thought Hast thou , in the course of seven enterprizing years , ever known me stoop from the originality of self to the slavery of another ?
'T is true , I admire the Lord of CHESTERFIELD : his epistles are , in the reading hour , always in my hand  at night they repose behind my pillow , and they at present constitute all my travelling library .
But I scorn to be fettered ,  either in body or soul .
The liberty of the understanding is as dear to me as the liberty of the person  and I have too much pride , too much dignity , to become a plagiary .
No , THORNTON , the Earl is , as it were , my tutor  his sentiments are such as I have long felt , but such as , till now , I was cautious of avowing .
Hitherto I have been restrained in my actions , and lost half the joy of voluptuousness , because , forsooth , nobody had either reputation or ingenuity enough to keep me in countenance .
I swam the stream of pleasure , but was always afraid of going out of my depth .
For the herd of men are contented to be libertines in the ordinary shallow way , and , before the appearance of these enchanting Letters , we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity , to give credit to the efforts of an enterprizing spirit .
But now the impediment is removed , - the avenue is  opened , and the prospect of pleasure is palpable .
The repository of STANHOPE , the cabinet of CHESTERFIELD , the Earl 's arcanum , are all disclosed : - EUGENIA - bear , bear the name , ye rosy-winged deities of joy , in gratitude to heaven !
- EUGENIA has given to mankind the invaluable remains of her father , and in that present - ( Oh , THORNTON , echo EUGENIA ! )
- hath discovered , to every elegant character , fresh roads to the temple of felicity , and virgin , untasted resources of personal extacy .


My design then , is to indulge my principles , by improving upon those maxims which his elegant pen hath made fashionable .
Let others content themselves with the vulgar happiness of yielding beauty , entrapt simplicity , and the mere defloration of female youth , - I can not be circumscribed by such common , animal sensations :  - give me delicacy , give me difficulty , give me refinement , - give me innovation , - or take from me existence .


`` To beat the beaten track , - to taste the tasted , '' - Oh , shocking !
- insupportable !
I am above it .
I scorn it .


In a word then , THORNTON , what our GARRICK is to SHAKESPEARE , I am resolved to be to CHESTERFIELD , - the living comment upon the dead text .
The youth to whom the Earl 's Letters were originally addressed , thou knowest , is dead  and it should seem that he wanted soul to relish them , had he continued amongst us .
Peace to his uncongenial manes !
I claim the inheritance , THORNTON , and desire you will consider me as his son , by the adoption of his sentiment .
Nay , had these veins been filled with the rich stream  that fed the heart of STANHOPE , I could not have been more like himself .
- God forgive me !
but , were it not said that my mother was the Diana of her day , I should suspect she played my father the Alderman false , and that she threw herself into the conquering and accomplished arms of CHESTERFIELD .
- Earth and skies !
Mr. THORNTON , canst thou think I was the product of a plethoric Alderman , and that Alderman a dealer in hops ?
- Bastardize me , dear friend , in pity to my feelings  and rather than suppose me the offspring of such a conjunction , make me the by-blow of some deity in disguise , and let me catch a ray of comfort from illegitimacy .


So much for the introduction to our correspondence .
Of preface no more - Prepare for immediate action - A face  passes my window that throws attractions worth pursuing .
I press the wafer with my seal , that I may rise to reconnoitre .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THE Earl 's absent man has already exhibited himself .
He is of the name of HOMESPUN , and is the butt of the bath .
His soul is contemplative , and his body pedantic .
Never saw I so perpendicular , or thoughtful a figure : a very walking soliloquy  and his wife , or , at least , the beautiful She who hangs upon his arm - O THORNTON !
THORNTON !
- I have an object before me already , young , elegant , graceful , and ( I warmly hope ) a wife - If she should prove indeed the property of this pedant - if the stars should have thrown a hoop of gold in my way , my fortune is made .
- Soft a little  - my landlord enters - his eye looks communication - there is intelligence in every feature .
I am positive he will prove the Daily Advertiser of the bath .


Pray , Mr. - I forget your name - Mr. - Wyngood is my name , Sir .
- Pray , Mr. Wyngood , what fine young lady is that now walking with the straight , well-made gentleman in raven-grey ?


She is wife to the gentleman , Sir  and his name is Mr. HORACE HOMESPUN , a minister come to bathe for the Dissenters disorder .
There 's a vast deal of company , Sir , in town , and I think you are very lucky in taking my lodgings .
I have got the best lodgings in all BUXTON , and some of the best people in them at this moment .
Why now , Sir , you would not think it , but I can shew you such things as will surprize you .
- Here  he set off , and I followed him into a bedchamber , where , without any ceremony , opening the drawers of his lodgers , he took out a riding-hat , with a blue feather and a spangled button .
`` Lookee , Sir , did you ever see the like ?
Then here is silks upon sattins , and sattins upon silks  and they 're the kindest people in the world .
They live as cheap as possible .
Why I do n't suppose , one day with another , they spend a guinea  they pay only eight-pence a-piece for breakfast , a shilling a-piece for dinner , eight-pence for tea in the afternoon , a shilling each for supper , and fourteen shillings for lodging  besides washing , coals , candles , and wines , - a mere nothing , as I may say , for a watering-place .
I presume , Sir , you would chuse to join them , and live in the same manner .
I see you are a very worthy gentleman , and I will go mention you under the name of - pray , what name must I say , Sir ?
 - But no matter  I will tell Mr. HOMESPUN that a new lodger wishes to do as he does .
Sir , your servant  I will be with you again presently .


The fellow had it all his own way , THORNTON .
I interrupted him not , and am this very night to sup with master minister HOMESPUN .
I have walked down to the well , and drank a glass at this Helicon of health .
I was in this ramble the man of fashion , just stept out of the chaise , and elegantly disordered in my dress - my hair was tied with negligence , my curls loose and in the ton of confusion , and my frock discovered a genteel shape and the cut of a good taylor .
A miscellaneous group were passing away the intermediate hours betwixt tea-time and supper : the lame and the lazy , the merry and the mortified , were all upon the saunter : HOMESPUN was fondly ruminating  with his angelic consort in the shade  and something that had the appearance of a fop - I mean of the common kind - was saying smart things to a pretty well-woman .


Nothing , however , could induce me to stay a moment at this dull place , but the practice of precepts which will convert all places into a paradise , and make even a watering-place delicious .
- I am summoned by the supper-bell .
- Mrs. HOMESPUN - Oh , what a name for such a creature !
- is tripping it towards the sound , and HOMESPUN himself seems to forget his primitive uprightness of back , and steps briskly forward .


Farewel , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 CHESTERFIELD is right : attention annihilates learning , and carries away all before it .
I am in the road to rapture .
I have time only to give you the hint .
Another opportunity of being assiduous offers itself : the moment must not be lost .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 I IMPROVE every hour - Oh !
why did not the Earl sanctify the paths of dissimulation , that I might have lived to pleasure many years ago !
It is now only that I begin to live .
I have had , my dear THORNTON , in the course of a few hours , a conquest superior to ALEXANDER 'S .
I have made an ordinary coxcomb pleased with himself , and yet discarded by his mistress .
I have seen a learned husband detestible in the eyes of his wife for the first time  and I find him enraptured with the very man by whom he is made ridiculous : and all this from the practice of a single precept - Study to please .


 I will go through every sentiment in the Earl 's correspondence before I quit BUXTON : all the books in all the languages are barren and deserve to be burnt , but the epistles of my STANHOPE .
But - stop - I heard Mrs. HOMESPUN express her aversion to cheese  and ( though I like it myself ) I must hasten to order it may never appear again to offend her , Nothing is immaterial that pleases .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THOU mightst as well send folded to me a sheet of white paper .
Thou writest much , without saying any thing .
Thy heart is engaged in the ardour of some pursuit , and thy pen denotes agitation , bustle , and contrivance  but thou speakest , only generally .
I prithee , SEDLEY , reduce thy extravagant genius into order , and let me understand , by the post , the meaning of sentiments I perceive not at present the drift of .
If any-thing starts that demands assistance , or if thou meetest more adventure than thou canst thyself manage , tell me so , and I will order my horse to the door , and go snacks in your enterprizes .
Farewel .


JAMES THORNTON .


 Dear Sir ,


YOU remember , I presume , the jaunt I took in the last year to SOUTHAMPTON , the particulars of which , at the request of some friends , I suffered to be printed in the WESTMINSTER MAGAZINE , in two several letters addressed to the publisher , Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT , of Essex-street , in the Strand , London .
I there told you , that I was not quite so highly interested in , or entertained by , the scenes in a hurry before me , as my then patron , the Baronet , would flatter my  imagination with upon the road  and ( as I find those letters from the Westminster Magazine were reprinted into various other monthly publications ) I have reason to suppose my excursion afforded some amusement to a certain set of readers .


But , having since then been yoked to a damsel who hath a passion for these watering-places , and who ( bringing along with her a decent fortune ) has a right to indulge herself in such amusements as seem best unto her , I have a second opportunity to survey the customs and manners of water-drinkers and duckers  and can now give you many curious particulars by way of supplement to the accounts I have already published .


As my present cure is situated about thirty-seven post miles and a quarter from the waters of BUXTON , amidst the wonders  of the Peake , Mrs. HOMESPUN chose to pass a week at that place , for the benefit of a pain in the ancle , which became grievous about six minutes before she suggested to me the necessity of such an excursion .


That the cure of her ancle might be perfectly completed , I contrived it so , as to persuade the curate of a neighbouring parish to do duty at home in my absence , and resolved to stay a fortnight .
Of this fortnight only four days are yet expired  and though I never underwent the same degree of parade , of fatigue , and of impertinence , in any former fourteen years of my life , - not even when I preached thrice in the Sunday , and footed it to two of the cures , - yet HARRIET seems so happy in doing as others do , and finds such real felicity in the dullest spot I ever beheld , that I am in doubt whether even  the long residue of the fortnight will satisfy her , so as to return home , to peace , privacy , and the parsonage-house , without murmurings and repinings .


Oh !
Doctor , see the outlines of my situation , and pity me .
I am amongst a number of both sexes whose pleasures are my aversions , and whose amusements I can not relish .
I love quietness and the shade of life , and yet the house where I now lodge is as public as an inn at a fair .
I admire rural ornaments , and scenes of summer verdure beyond imagination  and yet the mountains of Arabia Deserta exhibit not a prospect so barren as that by which BUXTON is bounded .
I love to stroll into the shop of an intelligent bookseller , and to converse with him upon the topic of recent publications  - alas !
the bookseller of BUXTON has nothing in his shop but the trash that circulates at a  watering-place amongst the women .
I ran my eye over his catalogue , and never did I see such a collection : Clelia , Pamela , the Adventures of Cleopatra , Amusements at the German Spa , and the History of an Actress , were the best , in this bad bundle .


I mentioned the Reviews - no body called for them .
I talked of the Magazines - none were ordered .
I rummaged every row for philosophy - nobody reads philosophy at a watering-place .
I criticised the shelves for morals , but found them not .
I ventured to ask , but with some little hesitation , for Secker 's Lectures - the bookseller never heard of them .
I took a turn round the shop , and ( having forgot to bring any books with me ) would have taken up with almost any-thing approaching to the rational , but , in my progress , I had well-nigh overset a glass-case  of toothpicks , gold hussives , embroidered pincushions , and embossed snuff-boxes .


And now it appeared , that this harlequin trader was rather a haberdasher , than a bookseller .


On casting my eyes towards a person at the other end of the shop , I saw her bending wire , to form , what is facetiously called , a cap : over this person 's head was a goodly show of bandboxes  and across the window at which she sat , were ribbons variously twisted , and several specimens of her skill in decorating that part of the body which is now more ridiculous than any other .
Seeing such preparations for the outside of the head , I gave up the idea of finding any internal furniture  and , walking out of the shop , asked pardon for having so grossly mistaken a milliner 's and toyman 's , for a vender of matters in  the literary way .
- Just as I got to the door , a party of mighty pretty women , and my wife amongst the rest , ( for she already knew every body , ) came rustling into the shop , and in a lisping tone , attuned to the articulation of a watering-place , desired the haberdashery-millinery bookseller to look for JULIA MANDEVILLE - Julia Mandeville was not to be had .
Then let us have SIDNEY BIDDULPH , said the ladies - Sidney Biddulph was out .
I 'm for , THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART , cried a very grave-looking woman .
I wish , my dear , ( said my wife to me , with a very well-bred civility , taking less notice of me than usual , ) you had brought JOSEPH ANDREWS along with you - Oh la !
Ma'am , replied another , how can you possibly read such low stuff - the adventures of a footman , a kitchin wench , and a strolling parson - Nay , Madam , said HARRIET , do n't say any-thing against  the parsons , pray  remember I 'm a clergyman 's wife , and there he stands - an ABRAHAM ADAMS every inch of him - a 'n' t you , my dear ?


This was too much  I attempted to go , but HARRIET caught me by the coat .
The poor ladies were in great anxiety to find THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART had been carried off last season , by a person who took the road to GRETNA GREEN with her footman , in her way to London  though some ( said the haberdasher archly ) may think that was going a round-about way too .
If we ca n't get THE MISTAKES , suppose , rejoined the ladies , we make shift , till we can have something better , with TOM JONES - Aye , TOM JONES is tolerable enough , ( said a pale lady , ) if he would but say more about SOPHIA , and give us less nonsense about the old vulgar father , the  fusty aunt , and those unentertaining horrid creatures , THWACKUM and SQUARE .
As to his Introductory Chapters , as he calls them , I always skip 'em  and yet , if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were to expect , at the top of his chapters , I really think it would be a goodish , prettyish sort of a novel .
- Tom Jones , it seems , was now in reading by Lady Sallow 's coachman .
- The haberdasher recommended FILIAL PIETY - the ladies were satisfied that it was a dull , serious , sermonizing thing , from the title .
FILIAL PIETY indeed !
- send it to Miss Dorothy Desolate , who is come to dip for the dismals  or Lady Bab .
Bluebutter , who wants to drink away her frog-freckled complexion .
- Ha !
ha !
ha !
he !
he !
he .
-


The laugh was now more violent than the wit was brilliant by which it was occasioned ,  and my dear HARRIET , joined in it most cordially .
- They were about to depart without any books at all , when the haberdasher mentioned some odd volumes of the Spectator .
They asked what he meant by talking about such old things , which they had been obliged to read over and over again when they were at their boarding-schools .
Lord !
( cried one of the damsels , ) here 's DELICATE EMBARRASSMENTS - Oh !
the very thing - worth all the Spectators that ever were wrote .
Aye , take it , and let us go read it directly - It do n't end well I think , objected another  I had rather read EACH SEX IN THEIR HUMOUR .
- Here is Something New , ladies , said the haberdasher - As old as the poles , said the fair-ones .
- What say you to ELOISA ?
- Oh !
by all means - Have you got ELOISA ?
- reach it this moment - Oh , the dear book !
- there are three letters in the first volume worth all  the world .
- Come , it 's a nasty evening and not fit for walking , let us hurry away  and so send them , Mr TRASHLEY , to the Hall this instant .
Come , Mr. HOMESPUN , ( turning to me , ) you shall ` squire us .


They fluttered out , caught me by the arm , and carried me off in high triumph , ten times faster than I should have walked , had I been permitted to do as I thought proper .
But that is a matter by no means allowable , at a watering-place .
Even now I am summoned by a messenger , who says the party are waiting for me , to go into the walks .
I dare not stay to finish my letter , lest I should become ridiculous  so you must wait till I can next steal a moment from folly for friendship .


I am , dear Doctor , Your most humble servant , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 OH !
for the genius of old HORATIUS FLACCUS , that I might compress a volume of facts within the foldings of a single sheet of paper !
Hear , see , be convinced , congratulate me , and sing a Te Deum to thy friend , and a requiem to the immortal memory of STANHOPE .


The party , of which I was made one , consisted of master minister HOMESPUN , his lady , an animal who burlesqued the coxcomb , and a fourth who departed before the entrance of supper , so that of him I shall say nothing at present .
- HOMESPUN and his wife are opposites ,  and therefore the better suited to the trial of skill .
At first I said no more than just to shew my breeding , and inclination to be happy in their society .
I let them shew off themselves as much as possible , that I might accurately learn their tempers , before I ventured to attack them .
HOMESPUN soon discovered himself to be a grubber in books  and his lady , a lover of the fashions  gay , giddy , good-natured , unsuspicious , and uninformed .
The coxcomb was of the neutral kind , but wished to be flattered , for his taste in personal ornaments .
Never was there a more curious trio .
The conversation turned at first upon weather , then upon books , then upon dress , and last upon the virtue of the BUXTON waters  and I accommodated myself to the several changes with tolerable facility .


And , first , to touch the tender part of  our bookworm , I observed that the public sustained a great loss in the death of several ornaments of the age .
I spoke critically , as to the satiric powers of CHARLES CHURCHILL  and poetically , as to the Pindaric flights of GRAY .
I entered into the intricacies of the epic , and drew the line betwixt the original HOMER and the imitator VIRGIL .
I spoke of ease , in the style of TILLOTSON  and of the pathetic , in the periods of YORICK .
I affected even to discountenance the innuendo of TRISTRAM SHANDY , and I compared his licentious spirit with the voluptuous OVID .
I pretended to discover an ostentatious display of talents in the Orations and Epistles of CICERO  and I took care to suit every opinion to the taste of the person I addressed , who had his share in the conversation too , and who ( as I have since heard ) mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning .


 I must not forget to tell thee , that , when I was talking upon books , and mentioned the ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM , Mrs. HOMESPUN ( though no simpleton ) asked me , with great simplicity , if that was a novel  to which the fop answered Yes , it came out last year , and was written by an intimate friend of his , but that , though he pushed it with all his interest , it did not take , and was now totally buried in oblivion .


I contradicted this with all possible politeness - I imagined he might be mistaken : that work , I believed , was attributed to LORD KAMES - a writer , with whom I did not doubt but he was acquainted .
Possibly he might confound the title a little , with others similar to it  which might very easily be done .
I had caught myself in such errors a thousand times .
Mr. HOMESPUN chuckled at my candour .
 Mrs. HOMESPUN ( I know by her eyes ) said something to her husband , in a low voice , in my favour  and the fop himself , with a smile of complacence , but without any confusion at detected ignorance , ( - such , THORNTON , is the force of manner !
- ) said , it was very likely he might be misled by the title  that there were three or four elements , and he was most superlatively obliged to me for setting him right .


Upon the topic of dress , I took care to agree with Mrs. HOMESPUN in every particular  except that , now and then , I affected , in a gentle tone of voice , and submissive smile of countenance , to differ from her , on purpose to throw the triumph on her side , make her happy in an ideal superiority , the better to impress her with a proper notion of my good manners , in yielding to conviction .


 The fop hopped out about twelve o'clock , and took me by the hand in token of satisfaction .
Honest HORACE ( that is his Christian name ) considers me as his comforter , and declares that he hopes for some happiness now , even in a watering-place  and Mrs. HOMESPUN , or , as I shall call her hereafter , ( to use as little as possible that vulgar name , ) HARRIET , makes no scruple of saying , I am the most chatty , agreeable man at the bath .


I caught her , THORNTON , twice measuring me from top to bottom , and then she gave HORACE a survey .
- By the soft , half-suppressed sigh she gave at the end of it , it is easy to see - whose dimensions she likes best .


Oh !
THORNTON , if I can once bring her to be discontented with her situation ,  - if she once begins to repent of her bargain , the day is my own !
I never saw a pair of eyes more likely to fall in love than hers .
The eyes of HORACE are grey , and without lustre .
She hath the right lips of invitation : the vulgar HORACE smackt them at something she said , but methinks the impression was only skin-deep .
She is in full health , and in the hey-day of female youth !


Oh , THORNTON !
THORNTON !
pray earnestly , that she may be miserable , and that the despair of her heart may be removed , only by thy friend


PHILIP SEDLEY .


 HORACE HOMESPUN will , I perceive , have , in due time , a horn upon his head  and yet I feel a pang for the poor pedant .
- Hang it , SEDLEY , why shouldst thou pluck the rose from the matrimonial pillow ?
Why plant a thorn in its stead ?
- But - but - I beg pardon : 't was a tug of conscience .
I am ashamed of the sensation .
I half blush at the impoliteness .
Go on , and prosper .
I am all expectation till I hear of the downfal of the bewitching HARRIET .


Farewel .
JAMES THORNTON .


 THE horrors of the gout , and the tremblings of the palsy , seize thee , for throwing a thought across me , that hath well nigh torn a leaf of CHESTERFIELD from my heart !
- The matrimonial rose !
- Oh , thou barbarian !
Wouldst thou ruin my principles , and have me act in repugnance to my preceptor already !
- Infidel , avaunt !
My creed is established .
Dare not , - on thy life , THORNTON , dare not again attempt to make me an apostate to PLEASURE .
Half-bred man , be silent and attentive .
I have a scene to paint to thee might thaw the frigid feelings of an Anchorite .


 About one o'clock in the morning , the eyes of HORACE began to twinkle , - what was before dull became duller , till at last the four eye-lashes met together , and covered the balls of sight .
HARRIET continued loquacious and lively , and resolved not to go to bed till it was a more modish hour , insisting , that I should keep her company .
I humoured her vivacity till HORACE began to snore , and then shifted the conversation to something less spirited .


Sentiment , THORNTON , when enforced at a proper crisis , is a better weapon for a man of pleasure , than downright licentiousness .
I began to sing forth the happiness of Mr. HOMESPUN  said many things in praise of his learning , honesty , and hospitable turn of thinking - told a tale of disappointed passion - descanted on the difficulties often attending reciprocal  attractions - placed two young people in several affecting situations .
I altered the tone of my voice , and suited it to the stillness of the night - sighed in whisper - corrected myself - called a tear into my eye - assumed a softened flexibility of feature - and , now and then , took my eye from viewing her , as if sensibly struck with my danger .


Part of the flowers with which she had been some time playing , fell on the floor - I took them up with a trembling hand , and put them into hers , with a pressure scarcely perceptible .
There was a sudden blush over her face in a moment .
I took no notice of it  but , catching up a myrtle-sprig , kept it sportingly as if to conceal a new sigh - presented it to her as the feshest on the table , and rose to take my leave .


 It was the exact moment of departure .
She was visibly agitated , and I would not see it .
She took the sprig , and I saw the leaves shake .
I went softly to the door , left with her the compliments of the night , in a gentleness of the tones perfectly pathetic - lingered at the door a moment - complained that I could not open it hastily for fear of disturbing her husband - at last , I almost shut it - half opened it again - stood the third of a minute , in a finely-dissembled state of embarrassment - once more bade her farewel , and indeed departed ,


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 A POST-CHAISE and four this instant stopt at the door of mine host , in which were three new visitants .
The fore-glass was let down by a female hand , so exquisitely white , and so full of promise , that I was induced to examine the other parts of the person to which it belonged .


THORNTON , she is a cherubim !
a mixture of beauty and breeding !


As she stept from the chaise , she discovered an ancle formed by Harmony , and  polished by the Graces .
Her shape is admirable .
I only scribble this to announce her arrival at the bath .
Thou knowest the rest .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THY letter is just brought me by the postman .
A cursed circumstance , that requires my attendance in town till next Wednesday , prevents my present happiness .
But my horse shall be at the door at Thursday 's dawn  and I will order relays , by which means I shall reach BUXTON at dinner .
Take care of the Cherubim for thy friend ,


Farewel .
JAMES THORNTON .


 ORDER not thy horse to be bitted - put not thy presumptuous foot in the stirrup .
Invade not the sacred prospects of a friend 's felicity .
There are only two forms in BUXTON worth undoing - HARRIET HOMESPUN , and the Cherubim !
- Sit quiet , and saddle not thy steed , if thou wishest the continued affection of thy


PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THE journey has already had a good effect , my dear LUCY , upon poor FANNY .
We travelled by easy stages , and I hope much from the alteration of air , even if the waters should want virtue to restore her .
The poor thing has been to all the baths in the kingdom , you know , except those of BUXTON .
Alas !
I fear her disorder has got too near her heart for medicine  and the God that afflicts , can only , I believe , remove the affliction .
Never was known so gradual a decline , and yet no application could stop its progress .
- What a pity , LUCY ,  that such a form should be daily decaying , before the eyes of the most tender relations !
Company , conversation , the simplicity of her diet , the wholesomeness of the situation , are all that can be expected from a short residence here , as the waters of BUXTON are not strongly recommended in consumptive complaints .
She is always best in society , and I am happy to tell you , the place is tolerably full .
Her poor fond husband hangs over her fading form , with more tenderness than when it was in its bloom .
Pray Heaven these assiduities may prove successful !
I with write again soon .


DELIA DELMORE .


 SOFTNESS to the sick is better than a cordial !
FANNY ventured yesterday to breakfast in public : her delicate form , beautiful in distress , instantly attracted , and claimed , what it received , - the attention of the whole company .
She was dressed with her usual simplicity , and suited her ornaments to her situation .
In my life , I never saw any body , in the luxuriancy of health , half so interesting .
After the first dish of tea , the flush , which was formerly a constant resident , revisited her cheek - the disorder has not , in any degree , tinged her complexion - her forehead is , as it ever was , alabaster white  and  the veins , that meander round the temples , are so transparently blue , and the circulation seems to be performed so pacifically , one might almost envy the delicacy , which a cruel disorder hath bestowed upon her .
In the eyes of several young ladies , who , by their florid appearance , came hither merely for amusement , I saw the glistening drop of sympathy - and the men , who were laughing at our entrance , soon softened their voices , and spoke almost in a whisper , in compliment to the lovely invalid , who appeared to want such attention .


FANNY was sensible to their indulgence , and smiled acknowledgment .
At last , in came a stranger , elegant and easy beyond description .
- How , my LUCY , shall I proceed ?
- FANNY sunk upon my arm , complained that she was worse on a sudden , and rose to go out - the stranger assisted ,  with a gentleness not to be described , and she tottered down stairs , under these supports , to her apartment .


I am so affected at present , that I can write no more .


 HEAVEN scarce allows me strength to tell you , that I am come to a place , of all others , in the habitable world , the most miserable to me .
In a word , the only person upon earth that I would have avoided , is at the bath .
God protest me , what am I to do !
Pity and pray for , the dying


FANNY MORTIMER .


 Dear Friend ,


I REALLY begin to think , I shall find some satisfaction at BUXTON bath .
Amidst a cluster of insignificant characters , one gentleman has distinguished himself so much above the rest , that I have at once gratified my pride and curiosity in his acquaintance .


He is intimately acquainted with polite and elegant learning , perfectly well mannered , and not above conversing upon  subjects of divinity , and ethics , even at a watering-place .
My wife says , he understands to a nicety , what some of the waterers call the ETIQUETTE of dress  and with the arts of a scholar , he has , it seems , the invention and taste of a courtier , without any-thing of courtly insincerity .


In truth , I am apt to think very favourably of him , especially as his exterior does not seem more frank and open , than his interior is ingenuous and undisguised .
One such character will atone for the stupidity of the rest .
As I am fond of , now and then , what I call a wood-walk , or a ramble by myself , I can now take this without a breach of good manners , for I can leave this accomplished gentleman with HARRIET , who is fond enough of his company to accept of him in my absence .


 I am half inclined to forgive watering-places , which have , in the end , after much , prior disappointment , produced so agreeable a companion , whose sentiments of life , and maxims of moral conduct , do credit to himself , and honour to the species .


I am , dear Doctor , Your faithful servant , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 OH , that I could live at BUXTON for ever !
We have , since I last wrote to you , got acquainted with the handsomest man in the world  and tho ' he is as good a scholar as HORACE , yet he understands , as well as I do , all the prettinesses of dress , which , you know , HORACE is entirely ignorant of .
Then he is so polite , so unaffected , he contradicts with such gentleness - he is so open to conviction !
- You know my aversion to filthy cheese .
I happened only to hint this , and he ordered it never to be brought again to the table , while I was at the bath  tho ' Mr. HOMESPUN said ,  I ought to suffer what was offensive to myself , out of good-manners to the company .


'T is hardly worth attending to , and perhaps you 'll laugh at my taking notice of such a trifle , but he sits in a chair , eats his victuals , cuts it into slices , and holds his knife and fork as different from HORACE as possible , who , you know , sometimes seems so over head and ears in thought , that he forgets the dinner is before him , picks his teeth , and sits silent , till the cloth is ready to be taken away .
Then again , as to carving , HORACE can no more do the honours , of the table than a baby : he misses the joint , and sometimes scatters the sauce in ones face  - whereas this gentleman , hits the mark as dexterously as a surgeon , helps the ladies to the greatest delicacies , with such a gentle manner , and with a countenance  so smiling , that it is impossible to refuse what he offers .


At supper last night , HORACE was in one of his thoughtful moods , and disgusted me horridly .


There was a roasted fowl  and HORACE , perceiving my plate empty , must needs fill it with one of the wings , which he made shift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating , though another for the purpose was lying on the other side the dish .
Then he must needs make my wing swim with the gravy , and , in awkwardly tilting the dish , several drops flew upon the gentleman 's waistcoat .
Mr. SEDLEY - that is his name - said , it was no matter  it was not easy to help such accidents  and begged he would consider it as of no sort of consequence .
- Sweet fellow !
- Oh , that HORACE  would imitate him !
He is now walking towards our lodgings , and HORACE slouching by the side of him .
HORACE is upright enough , but then he looks as stiff and uncomfortable as an overstarched shirt .
- SEDLEY moves as if he was quite happy : Mr. HOMESPUN struts as if he was in misery .
They are both at the door .


Adieu , adieu .
HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 THE proverb is verified : It can not rain , but it pours !
The Cherubim I mentioned to thee in my last , is a cherub of an inferior order , when compared with the SERAPH who came with her .
She was at that time muffled up and close hooded  but when , on the next day , the veil was withdrawn , judge of my surprize , when I beheld the very She , the charming She , whom last season I met with her father , Sir HENRY DELMORE , at SCARBOROUGH , at the very period , that the letters , of my divine Earl became popular , and I had brought a copy of them .
We lodged in the same house ,  and I became agreeable to Sir HENRY .
The very first trial I made to reduce my favourite precepts to practice , was upon the heart of this very girl , then glowing with all the graces of health , and endowed with all the enchantments of a pathetic temper .
I soon pretended to lose my vivacity , and became the softest son of sentiment that ever was born .
The net of silk , which I had diligently woven , became successful  and I had certainly caught in it the fairest prize in the creation , had not a cruel necessity called me from the bath .


Several transient tete-a-tetes I Had with her there , gave me the opportunities I wished .
Her passion was imaginary , but pleasing - she fixed high the standard of domestic felicity , and unreasonably loved to refine .


 To accommodate myself to this , was , at first , not easy  but before I quitted SCARBOROUGH , I was so distinguished for the pensenoso , that even Sir HENRY himself , began to think I was falling into a hypochondriac disorder , and used every effort to divert me .


Though I was then but a novice in the theory of joy , I had read enough of CHESTERFIELD to know the potency of dissimulation  and , had it been in my power to have staid another week , should have , even then , added an illustrious example , to corroborate that glorious precept , which advises `` to adapt the character and conversation to the company . ''


Since these transactions , she is altered , THORNTON , - altered in every part of her situation : the is married , and in a consumption  and yet , like certain fruits , she  is delicious in decay .
I was pleased to see her disordered at the first interview : the little blood that painted her cheek , disappeared , her knees shook , and her hands trembled at the recollection .
And this , too , was in a public breakfasting-room .
Judge how her agitation must alarm the company , and operate amongst the women in my favour .
Who knows , THONRTON , but the beautiful invalid may have brought herself to this state , upon my account ?
If so , ought not I to pity her ?
- and ought not she to thank the gods , that I again `` am come to comfort her ? ''
At all events , you ought to congratulate me , and once again sing Io Paean , to the canonized bones of CHESTERFIELD .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THE HOMESPUNS are secured  I have them by the heart , and enjoy , in an equal degree , the confidence of the wife and husband .


HORACE has many oddities , of which hid wife is lately become sensible  and it has been my business , to excuse them to her .
He is addicted to catch hold of the button , and , in the ardour of philosophical and systematic conversation , tugs at it most immoderately .
Last night , in supporting a favourite opinion , which was opposed stoutly by the fopling , he seized  the wrought button , and tore his fingers against the raised-work on the surface , till the blood fairly gushed out in a stream , and spotted his sables .
The fop swore , - I checked him with temper : the parson cooled in his argument , - and I applied an handkerchief to the wound , and thus saved them both from looking silly .


HORACE 'S nails are not quite so accurately clean as they might be  and , as I observed Mrs. HOMESPUN comparing them with mine , I suddenly closed my hand , as if out of tenderness , lest the comparison should turn to HORACE 'S disadvantage  yet this very tenderness , so managed , answered the design compleatly , and I can see plainly , HARRIET thinks hardly of HORACE for neglecting to pick the dirt from under his nails : while , on  the other hand , when he and I are together , we laugh at the fopperies of the times , and seem mutually , to despise all its DELICATESSE .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 CORMORANT in pleasure !
insatiate conqueror !
What , is not one object sufficient at a time ?
Must thy bow have seven strings to it ?
and Canst thou not be satisfied with the victory thou wilt soon gain over the buxom HARRIET , but thou must plot captivity for the Cherubim , and hope to carry all before thee ?
This is illustrating thy favourite Lord 's maxims with a witness !
And wilt thou not bestow a single beauty to thy friend ?
Be this as it may , spare - I conjure thee , spare the delicate distressed - harm not the gentle FANNY  but suffer her to live  the short remainder of her days , in the purity of conjugal caresses - spot not the ermine at expiring chastity , but let her spirit ascend , immaculate , to heaven .


Do this , if thou art a man !
The high in health may admit , and return thy revels  but pity the sick sister , and let not the maxims of thy Preceptor be made subservient to sanctify barbarity .
If thou triest to ensnare the sinking soul of FANNY MORTIMER , thou art a fiend , and unworthy the friendship of thy


J. THORNTON .


P. S. Is it not said , in the volume of thine Oracle , `` A man is fit neither for business or pleasure , who either does not ,  or can not command and direct his attention to the present object , and in some degree banish , for that time , all other objects from his thoughts . ''


How is this admonition consistent with thy scheme of three at a time ?
Study to be consistent , or all is over .


 THE very worst reasoner in the dominions of GEORGE , is JAMES THORNTON , Esq. .


And so , because I have an eye upon three , thou supposest I must needs be inconsistent , and irregular !
Dost thou not know , that the same Oracle advises , a quickness of attention , an unobserved observation , the art of seeing all the people in the room without appearing to look critically ?
Is there not , according to that Oracle , pretty nearly the same degree of deception in every character   and are we not to turn all this hypocrisy to our advantage , even while we seem to think every body honest ?


The great nicety in my present situation , thou dost not see  nor will I be at the pains to develope it to so awkward an arguer .


What a conclusion hast thou drawn , indeed , from my having three objects in view !
not considering , that I am as cool and collected as if I had but one  and that I have a capacity , equal to the conquest of thirty times three .


Learn to know me better .


I am too well disciplined in my system , to be precipitate , or to hazard the mortification of being disappointed , by  rashly seizing that which I perceive can only be attained gradually , by the successful efforts of resistless insinuation .


The Master of my Art says , very truly , - ` Little minds are in a hurry , when the object proves too big for them : they run , they puzzle , confound , and perplex themselves  they want to do every thing at once , and never do it at all .
But a man of sense takes the time for doing the thing he is about , well  and his haste to dispatch a business , only appears by the continuity of his application to it : he pursues it with a cool steadiness , and finishes it before he begins any other . '


This last sentence , THORNTON , thou mayst think , clashes with my present attack upon the three beauties of BUXTON .


 Thou art again mistaken .


I am not in a hurry to be happy , as to the ultimatum of female favours .
Like a man of resolution , I can watch the progress of a favourite pursuit , and see it prosper under my eye , without seizing the final recompence of my labour , till it is the proper crisis of fruition .


To bring these arguments home to the points in question , thou must understand , that , had only HARRIET HOMESPUN been at the bath , I should have been contented till her finishing  but as the Fates have thrown two sisters in my way , of which one happens to be an old acquaintance , but whom accident permitted to slip through my fingers unconquered , or , at least , without bestowing upon her victor the rewards of conquest , I must suit myself to the triple tie  that chance hath  laid upon me , with as much adroitness as I am able .
And this is the delicacy in my situation , to which , in the beginning of this letter , I alluded .


One great part of my system is , to make people , who are to give me happiness , happy in themselves .
I must , to this end , take care to avoid making any of these dear creatures rivals to each other : - to boast of amours , thou knowest , is utterly repugnant to the STANHOPEAN principle .
Press for the favour , read the eyes , fix the heart , and revel over the yielded person , ad eternitatem  but keep the joy to thyself  nor ever , with rascal loquacity , betray the infirmity of her , whose indulgence has give thee the first of felicities .


To one friend I have ventured to disclose myself in the very confidence of my  soul .
If thou betrayest me , though but in the hour of ebriety - it does not admit of an if , - thou art a guarded , honourable character .


No more , I prithee , as to plurality of objects .


The CHESTERFIELD system admits not the fearful and filthy intercourse of venal women .
He could not allow the horrid and vulgar hazards of c - s and p - s. `` Avoid , '' saith he , ( in his coelestial chapter on Pleasures , ) ` the fate of the promiscuous fornicator : what a wretch is a rake with half a nose , crippled by coarse and infamous debauches ! '


Hence , THORNTON , it is evident , that a man is justified ( provided he keeps the secret ) to search the circle of the earth for those favours , and elevated connexions ,  that bring along with them the honey without the sting .
It is beneath a gentleman , to beat round the bagnio 's , or criticise the brothel .
Leave such to the appetites of apprentices , whose vulgar palates can digest any-thing .
Be it the business of those who are governed by the laws of good-breeding , to enlist themselves under the white banner of apparent modesty , and invite embraces , unallayed by terrors and suspicions .


The constitution of a man of fashion , demands , in these cases , the utmost circumspection : the wife , the virgin , and the FRIEND , only , promise this blissful security .
To them , then , let us direct ourselves in self-defence , and thus procure the personal paradise , in which the roses of beauty bloom without a thorn .


 I have said thus much to silence thee , once for all , as to the nature of my favourite principle  which thou now perceivest to be , not more pleasing than rational .
No more , then , of thy whining passages about pity , and virtue , and all the et-caetera of parsonly cant .


The man of taste and fashion moves above it .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 Dear Doctor ,


WE are all wrong again !


The head of poor HARRIET is certainly turned  and , instead of a cure being performed , she is certainly distracted , by these same waters of BUXTON .
This day we drank tea in private , and never heard I such a train of conversation as she fell into .
Why , Doctor , she is gone - her intellects I mean - past redemption .


 For the first time in her life , she found fault with every-thing I did .
She insisted upon it , I drank my tea too hot , which was not only , she said , injurious to the coat of the stomach , but shockingly indelicate .


The tea-spoon was not managed to her satisfaction .
I sipped too loud from the saucer , when it would , I find , have been genteeler to apply a silent lip to the cup .
Nay , what is worse than all this , I had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter ineligantly  and it would have been better there too , if I had put the ends , rather than die side of it , to my mouth first .


But that which most astonished me , was her objection to the good old custom of turning down my cup , which she said was out of the TON , and that it would  give her great pleasure , if , in future , I would lay the spoon across the cup .


I was perfectly petrified , and yet ` held my tongue , and spake nothing . '
- She proposed walking , and , as I really thought the air might do the poor creature 's head good , I drew on my gloves , and attended her towards the well-walk .
- Alas !
Doctor , nothing , I fear , can bring her about  for she grew ten times worse than ever , and if I was astonished before , I was now almost struck dead with the hugeness of my amazement .


I had not the happiness to hit her fancy even in my walk , which she very fairly told me , was ridiculous  and that I held up my head too high , turned in my toes too much , and wanted the Graces in my arms .


 She actually made an objection to the manner in which my wig was powdered , said it was all in patches , and had not the regular sprinkling of a man of fashion .


Upon this , I ventured gently to tell her , that I was but a country curate , that I had no pretensions to fashion - that I had , for my own part , nothing to do at watering-place , but to oblige her - that I was very sorry , for the loftiness of my head , which , for the time to come , should be carried with more humility - that , if it would give her any pleasure , I would take care to stoop till I bent neck and shoulders together - that , as to inversion of the toes , I would learn to dance , late in the day as it was for me , and inconsistent as such a part might be thought to the clerical character - in regard to my arms , that I had hitherto only  used them in the ordinary offices of life , and found they performed very well for a plain man  but that , if she had any favourite attitudes , or wished me to exhibit in any postures to which she was particularly partial , I would practise vigilantly at the looking-glass , and , rather than want the Graces she spoke of , would absolutely learn the exercise , and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs , arms , head , and hands , like a young recruit .
At the same time I begged her to consider , that , as we had , since the day of our union , lived harmoniously , I warmly hoped we should not be put out of tune by trifles , which are in themselves insignificant , even if we admitted them to be essential to the etiquette of a watering-place .
I , moreover , told her to remember , that I was at least a faithful husband , and made her happiness the study , practice , and contrivance , of my  whole life : and that , surely , where the cardinal duties were observed , it mattered little whether the toes were the breadth of a barley-corn too much in or out , or the head half an inch too lofty , or half an inch too low .
I would have proceeded in my defence , but that my good friend Mr. SEDLEY at that instant came to my relief , told us , as he advanced with warmth , vivacity and a chearful countenance , that , ` if we did justice to his attachment to us , we might judge of the joy be felt in seeing us so frequently chuse a private path , which was to him a certain indication of matrimonial felicity . '


There was something so pretty in his speech , that it made an impression on my memory , and I have copied it verbatim .
In less than half an hour , Mrs. HOMESPUN recovered her reason  her  late lunacy was never hinted at , and , hoping to continue her good-nature , I invited this most agreeable gentleman to take another bit of supper with us .


The manner in which he accepted the invitation , trebled the sense of the favour he did me by his company .
What a gratification it is to have so sensible and entertaining a friend at a watering-place !


Dear Doctor ,


I am yours truly , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 A MAN , THORTON , who is true to the relish of pleasure , can extract extacy even from disappointment .
The bliss of blisses alone , could have made me happier than I was an hour ago .


Hear the story .


Since the first moment I cast my eye upon the bewitching HARRIET , I marked her for my own  and she hath since been the grand point of all my insinuation and ingenuity .
Not a single article hath been neglected that could touch her imagination , move her heart , and catch her favourite  weaknesses .
I paid court to her fancy , to her feelings , to her foibles .
Constant attention hath done the business I expected it would , and I have but one effort more , to be master of all that the sinest woman in the world has to bestow .


Last night , my THORNTON , was the conscious period that yielded up every transport but the one .
HORACE was requested to perform the funeral-service over the corpse of a fellow who died by a dropsy  ( as the parson of the parish was indisposed )  and , it seems , he was to be buried at a town a mile distant from our lodgings .


He went .
- The opportunity was not to be omitted .
I exerted myself .
I sparkled in the lustre of STANHOPEAN sentiments - I became eloquent , and soon communicated a part of my ardour to the  troubled bosom of HARRIET .
I hit her , soft upon the heart .
Our eyes met - they confirmed our sentiments - our voices grew soft as the summer-breezes - there was no intruder - I laid my cheek close to hers - they were both upon the glow - for the first time in my life , I kissed her lips - I repeated the pressure - she repulsed me - I dropped upon my knee , and in that attitude repeated the offence - Nature was stirred to the uttermost - I continued to suck the delicious poison , and unawares she returned the salutation .
The dalliance was no longer to be borne  she begged me , for God 's sake , to desist .
The flush of desire and modesty , were at war in her cheek - her bosom palpitated - I plied her with my precious maxims in a whisper , that gave them additional graces - I laid my hand upon her heart : the throb was violent  and , as I caught her eagerly in my arms , her head sunk  in unresisting softness on my shoulder , and , worked to the extreme betwixt sentiment and sensation , she burst into tears .


I composed her cheek - drew her handkerchief gently over her eye , fixed her again , without offering to distress her , in her chair  and to this moment she thinks I sacrificed , to love , respect , delicacy , and friendship , a passion that is tearing me to pieces .


In a few minutes HOMESPUN returned  he is no reader of looks , and I took my leave for the night with that easy , intrepid assurance which belongs to the great character I have adopted .


And now , THORNTON , am I not a tolerable proficient in the science of dissimulation ?
Does any-thing come amiss to me ?
Can I not assume with ease , and  wear with chearfulness , every shape ?
Are not heat , cold , luxury , abstinence , gravity , gaiety , ceremony , easiness , learning , trifling , business , and pleasure , modes which , according to my Preceptor 's advice , I am able to take , lay aside , or change occasionally , with as much ease as I would take and lay aside my hat .
- But you may expect nobler illustrations of this hereafter .
I am yet in the outset of my adventures - sporting ( by way of trial ) with jejune experiments .
The next time I can send THEE out of the way , HORACE HOMESPUN , beware !
Thou hast just escaped a sore evil .
A little while ago , thou wert within an inch of cuckoldom .


THORNTON , adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 Dear Doctor ,


SUCH a night as the last , I never passed .
My poor wife has had a relapse , Doctor .
It returned at midnight upon her , and raged with the most frightful violence for above two hours .
She is absolutely delirious , and I am the most wretched of men .


About an hour after we were in bed , she complained that there was no bearing  the heat  though , in truth , this is one of the coldest places in England , and it had rained all the preceding evening .
I felt her pulse , and it was immoderately full , tumultuous , and rapid .
I kissed her with all the tenderness of a sympathizing husband  - she asked me , how I could possibly be so cruel ?
I offered to lay her dear head upon my bosom , as upon the pillow of affection , judging that she would be pleased with my assiduities .
Her eyes were streaming in tears - her face was on fire - the sighs came from her , palpably against her consent .
I pressed to know the cause of this  at least , to what she attributed it  and offered to throw on my cloaths , and procure a Doctor .
Her cure , she told me , was out of the reach of a Doctor  but that , if I would not suffer her to be quiet without fretting her by my officiousness ,  she should be under the necessity of getting out of the bed , and sit till the morning in a chair .
A little time after this , she changed her manner , and with a kinder tone of the voice asked me , if I would consent to return home as soon as it was light .
She caught my hand , begged my pardon , wetted it with her tears , and begged I would excuse her infirmity .
I drew her , fond and close to my heart  and I felt hers , at that moment , leap with agony .
In the next moment she requested me to leave her , covered herself hastily head over ears with the bed-cloaths , and , saying that she wished I was wrapping her in the shroud , sunk sobbing upon her pillow .
Oh !
Doctor , what shall I do ?
What can be the matter ?
I am really unconscious of offence .
She is now in bed - perhaps , sleep may alleviate her disorder .
The  worst of it is , she will not allow me to speak to any third person  and , as I myself know nothing of either maladies , or their proper medicines , I am dreadfully alarmed , and tremble for the consequence .


Dear Doctor ,


I am your unhappy friend , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 Dear Doctor ,


CERTAINLY , Mr. SEDLEY is the best young man in England .
When he came to pay me the compliments of the morning , he found me in a very dejected situation  and though he was far from inquisitive , yet I could not conceal from his asking eye the nature of my calamity .
Poor young Gentleman !
it was evident that he , felt for me : his countenance lost , in a moment , all that fine glow that is natural to it  and , if  my fancy does not deceive me , he had some difficulty to prevent a tear from starting .
He assured me , that words were never made to do justice to the feelings of wounded friendship  that he was more interested in every-thing that concerned me and my wife , than he could express  and that , if I would suggest some little pretence , either of business or of invitation , to leave him with Mrs. HOMESPUN in the evening , he would certainly either comfort her by every ministration of the sincerest friendship , or , at worst , he would find out the reasons for her anxiety , and the nature of her complaint  after which , he very well observed , the remedy would be easy .
At this generous proposal , in which his worthy disposition was manifest , I was ready to weep  and , as we embraced each other at parting , our  voices became of no use to us , and we could only shew , by our sympathising enfoldings , that we had a sincere and christian regard for each other .


I am , Dear Doctor , Your most faithful servant , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 OH , CHARLOTTE !
CHARLOTTE !
what a perplexity am I thrown into , by this scheme of pleasure !
Accursed be the hour in which I set my foot upon the confines of BUXTON !
Unconscious of any violent partialities , I was contented while I was ignorant .
In the dreary village , where our parsonage is a palace , I was sufficiently happy , because I saw nobody superior to Mr. HOMESPUN .
I was the Minister 's lady , and the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood paid me the compliment of their best curtsey .
My HORACE really looked handsome in  his Sunday canonicals , and I viewed him in the pulpit with pleasure .


But , alas !
my CHARLOTTE , the scene is changed .
I have been several days in a place of politeness , where HORACE is the most awkward of the circle .
My eyes are now opened to his imperfections - I see them , I feel them , I detest them .
He is a lump of learning , without ductility , without softness , without - what Mr. SEDLEY calls , the Graces .
I am sometimes obliged to ask several times before I can obtain an answer to the most ordinary question , and then , at last , he bursts from his reverie , and pretends not to have heard me speak to him .
Can any-thing be so disgusting ?
His conversation is unlike that of the rest of the company  and , instead of bearing a part , in little , social , and endearing chitchat , he talks eternally about Locke , and  Livy , and Cicero , the Elements of Criticism , the Problems of Euclid , and such fellows - and many a time , when I have wanted him to put a pin in my handkerchief , or such little offices of endearment , he has been wrapt up in meditation , and then stared me full in the face without knowing I was in the room .


Then , he actually has a strange shy method of treating me as a wife .
There is no delicacy in his air , when he takes my hand : he shakes it indeed HEARTILY , but then he has the fat fist of a grasier , even though in other respects he is disagreeably thin .
He kisses , with a ceremony perfectly classical , as Mr. SEDLEY calls it .
There is a pretty method , methinks , even in the management of the lips .
By accident , Mr. SEDLEY stole a kiss the other day , and he placed it , so directly , so gently , and so pathetically in  the center , that I never felt such a sensation !
I protest , CHARLOTTE , it ran thrilling through every vein of me , warmed my very heart , and almost took away my breath .


We were , I remember , playing at questions and commands , the day being showery , so that we could not stir out .
The forfeit came round at last to HORACE , and he smackt me , as usual , in his round-about manner .
Heaven pardon me , CHARLOTTE , but I was obliged to draw my pocket-handkerchief across my mouth , and had some difficulty to avoid making a wry face .
If you was once in the company of Mr. SEDLEY - he is called the handsome SEDLEY here - you would never forget - gentle , graceful , elegant , soft , genteel , and eloquent .
- Heigho !
- Why , CHARLOTTE , why did I marry , before I had seen  something of the world ?
Or , rather , Why , after I was married , why did I ever stray from carts and cottages , to the delightful dangers of a watering-place ?
- But I must hide my letter  Mr. HOMESPUN is coming towards the house , as erect as a walking-stick .


Adieu .
HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 FANNY is much disordered , my dear LUCY  the fainting with which she was seized at the breakfast-rooms , has preyed on her ever since .
Her spirits are greatly agitated .
Her husband attends her , with the diligence of a nurse , and can not be persuaded to leave her chamber .
The poor girl often drops the tear of gratitude , but speaks less than usual , as she says , talking exhausts her .
She has twice hinted her wishes to be removed from hence , either to my father 's , or to SCARBOROUGH , as we thought proper : and begs her removal may be pretty late at night , for company ,  she says , rather disturbs her , since her last accident .
Poor MORTIMER , her husband , sees her dying by inches before his face , and his unavailing officiousness appears now and then , to go too near the heart of the sinking FANNY .
She is too indisposed to remove at present : for my part , I have not been able to set my foot yet in the street : I love my sister too tenderly , to leave her with a strange woman , in a strange place , especially with one , who is merely paid for her attention , and who , consequently , can have none of those charming thoughts that enter into the heart of a tender relation .
Sometimes , my dear , the changing a posture , sometimes the shifting a pillow , or fixing a chair , does more by the method of doing it , than all the elaborate efforts of an avowed nurse .
A Mr. SEDLEY - who is said to be the beauty of the Bath , and was the person that handed FANNY down  stairs , and was very obliging during her illness , - sends every day , very respectfully , to know how the sick lady improves in her health .
As many of both sexes were witness to poor FANNY 'S distress , and as people should have a fellow-feeling , in places of general resort for cures , as well as fashions , I wonder others have not paid this sweet girl the same compliment .


The manner in which this gentleman makes the enquiry , is pretty : he does not presume upon the privilege of a public place , and send a blundering foot-boy with a message , nor does he come , intruding , himself , but he usually writes a little billet , ( every day varied , and containing a new turn , ) in which his expressions discover at once accomplishment and high-breeding  and , what puts it out of any body 's power to misconstrue it  into design , he always addresses his cards to MR. MORTIMER .
As my brother was reading one of these this morning to his wife , she desired to look at the hand , but had scarce held it to her eye , before she dropt the paper , and , letting her arm fall languidly on the pillow , said , very softly , that she could not manage it , and was weaker than she imagined .


She is now in a gentle dose , and I took the opportunity it gave , to inform my dear Lucy of our present melancholy situation .
Sir HARRY , and my mother are expected hourly .
If FANNY really dies , my mother will certainly go distracted .
Heaven bless you , and yours .


DELIA DELMORE .


 IN the name of heaven , HARRIET , what are you about ?
Your letters alarm me beyond imagination .
You are in the road to ruin : I see you upon the very verge of perpetual infamy .
You can now mark the little imperfections of a husband : you are blind to his many virtues .
You have cast your eye on a man , whose person and manners you like better : with this man , you have been already left alone : you may be left alone again .
The next step is too apparent to be mentioned : you are very gay , very young , very inexperienced : there is but one way left to prevent your destruction ,  and that is , to return home directly , and make any excuse to HORACE for the abruptness of your departure .
I know nothing of the SEDLEY you speak , nor do I wish to know him .
Better had it been , on all hands , if you were as ignorant of him as I am .
It is plain he hath pleased you too well  since the pleasure is bought at the dear price of hatred to the best of husbands .
Yes , HARRIET , your HORACE is the best of husbands .
He is an honest man , if he is not a brilliant man  and , if he does not shine in society , he hath an excellent heart , and a simplicity of manners , truly amiable .
The little points of objection you have made , are , when weighed against his various virtues , light , and of no account  while , on the other hand , SEDLEY has , very probably , nothing but an elegance in trifling to set him of .


 Waving , however , these points , my dear , let us come to others more startling .
You are a wife , you are pregnant , you are advanced far in that pregnancy , you have a clear character , you have the love of an innocent neighbourhood - Away !
- away !
Order your chaise this instant to the door .
The matter does not admit of a moment 's debate .
I hasten to seal up my letter , and I beg , for God 's sake , for your own sake , and for that of all that love you , or that you love , that you will deliver your answer by word of mouth .


I shall catch you to my breast , as a dear friend , just escaped from a precipice , - as a treasure I have luckily rescued , in the minute of despair , from the surrounding flames .
Adieu : Adieu .
I enjoin you to be expeditious !


CHARLOTTE LA MOTTE .


 YOUR HARRIET is something happier than when she last sat down to address you .
Mr. SEDLEY has pleaded the cause of poor HORACE so persuasively , and that behind his back , ( there 's a generous man for you ! )
that I have been induced to ask his pardon , and I am resolved to treat him with more politeness , which I find is indispensible in the conduct of a married woman to her husband , even though he were indifferent to her .


We have past together a very happy  afternoon  and though I do not find any greater degree of tenderness for HORACE , yet , as I know how to make him happy , by merely suppressing those sentiments in his disfavour , which can do me no service to discover , I feel the sweets of disguiseing the truth upon some occasions .
I have restored HORACE to perfect serenity , and I as sincerely thank Mr. SEDLEY , for taking me to task .
Adieu .


I am , Dear CHARLOTTE , Your Affectionate , HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 THE first blow is not yet finally given .
Opportunity hath not favoured temptation sufficiently .
My system , not only demands that I should preserve the fact private , but the reputation of both the man and the woman , unsuspected .
I am not to be a harum-scarum rake , who brutishly and boyishly boasts of his successes , but a man of pleasure , who is to bathe his senses in bliss , and revel in the richest luxuries of enjoyment , ( privately , ) with consenting elegance  while ( in public ) I am to sustain a fair character , and pass upon men ( who only look  upon the surface ) as a pattern of purity , and a model for morals .


HARRIET is a bewitching , illiterate , sweet piece of unpractised Nature .
Her complexion is ardent , and I have sufficiently set her passions afloat  but I must take care to guard against working up my own .
All the power of all-conquering dissimulation is over , when DESIRE seizes the helm from the hand of cool and deliberate REASON .
`` Vigour and spirit '' are mere madnesses , without `` versatility `` and complacence . ''
Upon this principle , I must walk without deviation , like a faithful pupil , in the path that is chalkt out for me .
It is my business to ` lead right reason in the triumphant fetters and shackles of the heart , and the passions . '
In order to accomplish this , THORNTON , I must keep myself collected , and never strike till I have fully thrown every body  about me off their guard , and till I can , then , gratify , conquer , triumph , and enjoy in full security .
My blood , THORNTON , is as cool as a turtle 's .
HARRIET 'S , I see , is upon the boil : yet she has beauty enough to stir me  and when the secure moment offers itself , fear not her disappointment .
Her wishes - shall not be vain .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 I HAVE appeared in public .
I dined this day at the ordinary .
Ordinary indeed !
such a room full of emptiness I never beheld : citizens apeing the men of mode , women of sallow countenances , and fops , who would be thought witty and elegant , when they are merely saucy , and affected , and dull .
Alas !
THORNTON , what a pity , what a mortification !
I have not a single competitor , - I mean not in point of gallantry , for that militates against my system of pleasure , - but there is no one of my sex from whom I can gain any real honour in the comparison .
However , as even blockheads are  worth gaining , and their hearts worth misleading  as they have all foibles to flatter , and weaknesses that may be for our interest to work upon : I began to shew off , and brought the whole company over , as my admirers .
I practised all the charming conversation-rules of DORMER , with as much facility as if I had been the author of them  and , indeed , they are so suited to my own natural sentiments , that I only consider him as having written , what I long ago thought , and what I will henceforward invariably practise , till I am incapable of farther enjoyment .
I had the happiness to sit parallel to the very fop , already recorded in my correspondence  and he was over-dressed to all the extravagancy of the ton  while I had the advantage , of not in any sort , invading the modesty of Nature .
The fool lookt as if he piqued himself upon his gaudiness , he stroaked his ruffles , displayed  the baubles of his watch , perkt up his head to gaze in the pier-glasses , pulled his watch in and out of his fob several times , eyed himself ascance , and figitted up and down in his chair , with all the insignificant whiffling agility of the monkey in the fable , who had seen the world .


Close to the side of this popinjay , sat an unweildy animal , who , to the manners of a bear , united the uncouthness of an elephant , without half its sagacity  and who , in feeding , scattered his offals around , to the utter dismay of the coxcomb , who , fearful of complaining , and alarmed at the size of the antagonist , took shelter at a small table , or rather sideboard , and fluttered himself clean , while the monster enjoyed his embarrassment .
I am happy to tell you , that , though this piece of pleasantry set the unpolished table in a roar , I commanded my features ,  and did not give way to ridicule .
Hitherto I have never laught out since I came to BUXTON , and I solemnly hope I shall never be boorish , of boisterous enough to laugh out again , while I have being .


I eat elegantly , drank discreetly .
I smiled at a thousand dull stories , and only told one myself , and that , inconceivably a-propos .
I heard long talkers , without appearing to be tired , and I looked every person whom I addressed full in the face .
I dressed my countenance in softness , and gave the douÁeur to all my motions .
I interrupted no man , contradicted cautiously , palliated tenderly , decided a dispute betwixt the fop and the glutton with a good-humoured pleasantry , caught the habits of the company , swore not at all , and adapted my conversation to every speaker .
The consequence  was , THORNTON , that I was immediately known to be somebody , nay , I was the admiration of every body : my company was cherished , my absence regretted , and , at my going out of the room , a buz of universal approbation followed me down stairs .
In a word , THORNTON , the fops were annihilated , the prattlers were silenced , and I went off in the compleatest triumph of uncontested excellence .


And thus , having settled my reputation , and established myself PUBLICLY , it only remains that I enjoy my popularity by appearing to deserve it  and then I may bid defiance to censure , and then - WELCOME VOLUPTUOUSNESS !


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 Buxton .


RECEIVE TIMOTHY , the greeting of THOMAS .


I , and my master , arrived on the day we set out at this execrable place , where I have as yet done little more than stick a pin in SEDLEY 'S hair , and peruse a page of his CHESTERFIELD after dinner .


These books we are both excessively fond of , and as he always leaves them in the chamber-window , I take them up when he lays them down to walk out  by which means we make pretty nearly  the same progress .
If any thing , I believe I am half a volume before-hand with him , and , in the opinion of the judicious , am the finer gentleman of the two .


Not that my master , like your common coxcombs , ever mentions his amours , or his studies to his servant , any more than I discover mine to him : we are both better bred  but I have heard too much of CHESTERFIELD at table , at tea , and every where else , not to have had , long ago , a relish for his writings  and I scruple not to tell thee , TIMOTHY , that I have formed myself , what you know me to be , entirely on his Lordship 's model .


He had , beyond comparison , the prettiest pen , at an epistle , in Europe , and is at once so neat and plain , that it is  impossible to misunderstand him .
I once was as vulgar a dog in my choice of books as any in the kingdom  - I had no more taste , TIMOTHY , than a teacher of the table of multiplication .
I thought the luscious love-scenes of ROCHESTER delicious , and had a mighty hankering after the memoirs of CLELAND  but heaven defend me from such barefaced trash , The bawdry brutes !


` They shew too much to raise desire . '
No TIM .
Stanhope has brought me round , he teaches that ` the very shoe has power to wound  ' and I am by God 's grace , and his Lordship 's graces , as gracefully graceless a rascal , and as pretty a fellow as any in Britain .


I expect , by the Earl 's assistance , to do an infinite deal of mischief at this watering-place  - my eye ( though no  settler ) has pointed at a bath-maid , who attracted me in the handing a tumbler of Spa-water .
Nauseous as all minerals are , I took it and tost it off , because , I find , to refuse is ungenteel .
I shall subdue this damsel at my leisure , having , for my more serious simulations , as his Lordship calls them , a noble object in view , of whom you will hear more explicitly in my next .


SEDLEY is upon some project , but I scorn to be guilty of impertinent curiosity  and he is as much above making either a confident or a pimp of his servant , I should with more propriety have said his gentleman , as his gentleman is of wearing a livery of worsted lace .
God and the Graces speed him , say I , in all his undertakings !
Every man has a right in this world to follow  the bent of his fancy , to ` strew the way over with flowers , ' as the song says , and to be as happy , both up and a-bed , as he possibly can .


` Vale - ' as I see your scholars conclude , ` Vale - Adio - Adieu - '


THOMAS .


 YOUR letter came too late .
- The hour of circumspection is past , and I am in utter despair .


HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 ADD to the list of my conquests , or rather place at the top of the CHESTERFIELD catalogue , the ruin of HARRIET HOMESPUN .
Ruin , THORNTON , why ruin ?
In my system , the name should be softened .
The same of the she who grants the favour , is pure and inviolate as ever .
Where then the ruin ?
HORACE will sleep as sound this night as the last -


He finds not SEDLEY 'S kisses on her lips  He saw not , thinks it not : He that is robbed , not wanting what is stolen , Let him not know ` r , and he 's not robb'd at all .
 Well said WILL SHAKESPEARE !
By the same rule , master minister HOMESPUN , thou , being ignorant , art not robbed at all .
However , robbed or not robbed , I must pay another visit or two to thy treasure , before I take my leave of it for ever : for thy HARRIET is a most voluptuous banquet , and increases the appetite while she indulges it .
- By the next post , THORNTON , I shall dispatch another letter  mean time I am


Thine , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 AND so the dreadful prophecy in my last is fulfilled !
As an unhappy woman , I pity you  as an unchaste one , I can only keep your secret , pray for your repentance , and take my everlasting leave of you .


Farewel .
C. LA MOTTE .


 PUNCTILIOUS , prudish CHARLOTTE !
that mistakest a slip of the heart , for an error in principle .
Two days ago I entertained sentiments like yours .
Novels and vulgar notions , ruin half our sex : I have begun , and am still privately engaged in reading a BOOK , that sets all to rights in my own heart , and reconciles my conduct to my own conscience .
As to matrimonial shackles , I say with ELOISA , ` Curse on all laws but those which Love hath made ! '
Had I read the dear BOOK , now in my box under lock and key , a few months ago , take my word for it , CHARLOTTE , I had never  been a HOMESPUN , and would have died , rather than have given my hand to a looby of a bookworm , unacquainted with the Beau Monde , and unfavoured by the Graces .
My mind is perfectly at rest  and the only mad thing that flies in my face , is , having thrown away my charms upon a country curate , that does not know how to behave in company - who is unable to carve a chicken , or lead his wife into a ball-room , without hanging down his head , and biting his nails .


I am H. HOMESPUN .


 UPON my word !
- Oh brave !
- Why , you have made a rapid progress , and are an apt scholar , that 's certain .
A young creature scarce two-and-twenty , bred upon a barren mountain , little read in the ways of any part of the world , but the ways of a circumscribed village - a farmer to your father , and an honest wholesome dairy-woman for your mother - a little modicum of money to the tune of five hundred pounds , the savings of twenty pains-taking years of your poor grandam - and , and - to turn fine lady all of a sudden !
- to trip to BUXTON bath , in the height of the season , forget all  your country friends , and country feelings - all in a week - a little week !
Upon my honour , you are no common character , and I congratulate you on reconciling all this , and all that has resulted from this , to your capacious conscience .
Down to the very earth , I drop my curtesey , fashionable Mrs. HOMESPUN !


But , gracious God !
can it be possible ?
Is not the last letter , marked with your name , a forgery ?
Can the character , be Mrs. HOMESPUN 'S ?
Can it be written by her , whom I have so often distinguished for innocence in the midst of gaiety , and modesty in the very bosom of amusement ?


Is it practicable , in so short a space of time , to lose all that 's valuable , all that 's feminine , all that 's truly endearing  and to substitute , the most despicable ,  detested contraries ?
Ah !
HARRIET , HARRIET , how art thou fallen !
Thoughtless , ingrateful creature !
Poor HORACE , what is become of him ?
If he is yet in ignorance , in mercy to his merit , keep him so : at least , have the generosity - the humanity , to keep from his knowledge , that , which would cut his honest heart to atoms .


But what is the BOOK you allude to , as the panacea , of a person polluted , and a heart set against the venerable maxims of morality ?
Alas !
Madam , be not every way deluded : nor books , nor tongues , nor casuistry , nor all the chicane of eloquence misapplied , can possibly overturn the sober single system of unentangled innocency .
I yet hope , you are not in that wretched state , which , despairing of forgiveness , hunts about for apology , nor , rather than seem destitute ,  condescend to take up with one , that in effect , plunges you deeper in criminality .
A drowning creature , catches at the slightest twig : and a guilty woman , is fain to support herself from falling in her own esteem , against a tottering pillar .


BOOKS , HARRIET !
- find a refuge from the keenness of your own reflections in BOOKS !
Perish the volume , and may the name of its author descend ignominiously to posterity , in which the error , that you have , under your pathetic circumstances , been guilty of , is not palpably discountenanced !


Mention , however , the name of that book from which you receive comfort , and , woman as I am , I will undertake to baffle its boasted system , and shew , that the only way to genuine pleasure , is through the paths of purity , integrity ,  and singleness .
I am , and have continued a widow , five years upon principle : the man I have lost , was even less splendid than Mr. HOMESPUN , nor had his person any peculiar attractions .
What of that ?
He was good , he was great , and he was tender as Heaven .
I wanted not temptation , while he was living , to indulge indelicacies , but I valued both his honour and my own  and though I pretend to no gifts of preternatural continency , I defy either books or men , to make me act in diametrical opposition to common-sense and christianity .


But , just at the present crisis , you are , of all women in the world , the most inexcuseable !
Oh , heavens !
HARRIET , reflect a moment .
More than three parts gone with child - that child your first-born - the father an honour to his profession - his profession the Church !
-  I will say no more , for if you had my heart , enough has been said already to move you to add to your present errors , the crime of suicide .


Adieu .
C. LA MOTTE .


 ALL goes on to the utmost content of my heart .
Oh , THORNTON !
STANHOPE is infallible .
His maxims are perfect anodynes against disappointment , and I shall ( I do really think ) render him more celebrated than ever , by practically illustrating every precept in every period !
- I have played the second part of the same tune with HARRIET , and I half believe I shall make her a proselyte  for she hath got volume the first , and I have taken care to pencil the places at which I would have her stop : a mark in the margin always attracts .
HORACE and I , too , are hand and glove , and a very  worthy priest he is , for an HOMESPUN , I 'll assure thee .


I will give thee , however , an instance or two of my proficiency in the arts of pleasing .
When all was over , I paid my respects to HARRIET and her Lord , at the accustomed hour , without the least visible embarrassment , or alteration of countenance .
The poor woman , indeed , made but a bungling piece of work of it , blushed , stammered , and stopt short  while I took care to preserve every muscle and lineament steady and unmoved .
I see the efficacy of this most materially , for , had I not practised this presence of mind , I do verily believe even the unsagacious HOMESPUN would have suspected what had happened .
I took him by the hand , with the usual cordiality , and we walkt to FAIRFIELD , a neighbouring village , ( whither by the by he  was walking while the deed was doing , ) like inseparable friends .
So that there is , as thou perceivest , fresh reason for thy congratulation .


But I have other business in hand , and must leave thee , THORNTON .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 CURSE upon it , TIMOTHY !
SEDLEY hath caught me in the fact - the very fact of consulting his oracle .
He came home accidentally , when I thought him safe for at least an hour , and I was just enjoying the sweet sentiment , and had delv'd into the pith and marrow of the dear Earl 's epistle upon dress  when this indiscreet master of mine , absolutely forgetting his good-breeding , kicked me on the breech , took the book out of my hand , and led me down stairs by the nose : for which , if I forgive him ,


May the shame I mean to brand his name with Stick on mine !
 No matter : I know my cue , ` smile at present , and strike hereafter . '
Since this affair , the cruel youth keeps the Earl all to himself  but I see , by the newspapers which come down here , his Lordship 's good things are all collected together , in a little snug volume , that a man , upon any exigences , may pop either into his pocket , his bosom , his breeches , or elsewhere , as occasion requires .
This little essence of the Earl I desire you will procure me , TIMOTHY , forthwith , and send it down by the Fly : I shall not rest till I get it , for I comprehend every syllable he says , and I have as great a right to do roguish things with a good grace , as my master .
So no more at present from thy friend ,


THOMAS .


 Postscript .
The book will be bought under the title of ` Lord CHESTERFIELD 'S Advice to his Son , ' printed , as the papers say , for RICHARDSON and URQUHART , under the Royal Exchange .


 I BLUSH as I put my hand to the paper : I feel the severity of self-reproach : I have deviated from the maxims of my Preceptor , by making a man feel his inferiority .
In a word , THORNTON , I have struck my servant .
I caught the fellow reading in the sacred page of my religion , even in the page of the divine DORMER , never meant to be polluted by the eye of a footman , and I condescended to give him a blow .
This is amongst the list of unpardonable crimes , and I must make it up with the lad before I sleep , or I shall scorn myself  too heartily .
A man of fashion use his fist , and against his footman !
- SHAME - SHAME - SHAME !
- I have a thought to bring all even again .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 I COULD sing - I could dance  for alienation is no more .
THORNTON , I have atoned for my meanness  ask me now what I have given , what I have said , what I have done !
Whatever it was , be assured there was manner in it , and ` manner is every thing every where , and to every body . '


Farewel .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 Dear Doctor ,


THINGS are so pleasingly altered , that I have been over-ruled as to my design of going away even at the end of the fortnight , and I have contrived to procure another week 's recess , in order to extend my HARRIET 'S happiness , and enjoy myself the spirited , yet moral and engaging conduct of Mr. SEDLEY , who , every day , becomes more agreeable , and who , I do truly believe , has been not a little instrumental in  bringing about my poor wife to a proper sense of her duty and right reason .
If any-thing , she is more cordial to me than before my departure from the curacy , and is at once lively and obliging .


I take it for granted , the strange conduct I transmitted you an account of in my late letters , was only a transient giddiness , not very infrequent , as I have observed , Doctor , to the fair sex , about HARRIET 'S age , which is very well called , in one of SHAKESPEARE 'S tragedies that I read formerly , the ` heyday of youthful blood . '
We grave folks , you know , my dear DIGGORY , ought to allow for all this .
Poor thing , I pity her , and am half angry with myself that I should have treated the overflowing , effervescent emanations , as I may stile them , of a juvenile mind , as a serious delirium .


 But , thank God , it is not gone abroad to any person who is capable of circulating the whisper of the day to the detriment of a fellow-creature .
Mr. SEDLEY , who , I can easily see , is to be trusted with every thing , and my old friend , and brother-collegian , Doctor DIGGORY , are the only persons informed of the matter , and so all is well .
But do not , I charge you , think too hardly of her for what hath been said .
It was all a misrepresentation , and you should admire your heavenly HARRIET , as you used to call her , the more , for having been injured .
I can assure you , I am at present more satisfied with her than I am with myself : and , indeed , she has the advantage of me  for she appears in the light of a person calumniated , and I am only one in a state of conscious error , and probation .


 However , a short time will , I do not doubt , set us all as happy again as our hearts can wish .
- But why , my worthy DIGGORY , do you not write : how is it that so scrupulous a man in point of equity is so unexact a correspondent ?
You are deep in my debt , and though I am now rich in the inestimable treasures of reconciliation , yet a line from you would add materially to my fortune , and I should have to thank Heaven for as full a measure of felicity , as it is , perhaps , either proper or possible to taste on this side of it .


I am , Dear Doctor , Your most happy and faithful HORACE HOMESPUN .


 Madam ,


THE severity and rudeness in your letter I can pardon , because they find an apology in your want of breeding : but the liberty you take with me and my character , can not so readily be past over .


I am myself the guardian of my honour , And will not brook so insolent a monitor .
I am your deeply-injured HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 I WOULD give ten thousand worlds to stop the mail , and take out of it my last mad and ingrateful letter , even though I were to incur the punishment of robbing the post .


Excuse me , I beseech you - excuse the rashness of an enraged woman , cut to the quick by your just reproaches !
Instead of resenting , I beg of you to compassionate me .
My penitence is sincere , and you must - you will unite your prayers to mine , that it may be at the same time perfect and efficient .


Adieu .
HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 HA !
ha !
ha !
There is no law against laughing in a letter , as there is neither a vulgar noise nor a ghastly grin attending it : take , then , the silent mirth of my soul , and let me pour out upon paper some part of the exultation that at this moment swells my heart !


What a superficial animal is man !
` as easily led by the nose , as asses are ! '
the dupe of the senses , the idiots of mere exterior , and the very fools of a well-managed set of features .


It is usual with women , when the affair  is over , to whimper , lament the loss of reputation , the destruction of their eternal peace of mind , and grow stubbornly refractory , or else sullenly repineing .
This was formerly a vile piece of business , and was a sore draw-back upon the felicity of fruition  but the converts of CHESTERFIELD have no trouble of this sort to apprehend .
As the confessor can make the consent of a good-natured nun a point of piety and religion  so a man of manner , dress , address , and dissimulation , may manifestly prove , to either maid , wife , or widow , that the shortest , as well as the softest conveyance to heaven , is , upon a feather-bed .


Without any sort of hum , haugh , stammer , or hesitation , I have convinced HORACE that he has been notoriously in the wrong  in consequence of which he is to kneel oftener than his professional bendings  require - I have firmly persuaded HARRIET , that all our future pleasure depends on behaving ten times better than ever to HORACE - and lastly , I have prevailed on the curate to indulge his wife a few days longer , as a first instance of his repentance .
In the rashness of her heart , she hath told all to a Mrs. LA MOTTE , who hath written a chiding epistle in the old scolding way  and to this , I find , she ( HARRIET ) hath replied in justification of herself .
Here I was obliged to set her right , and have taken care to see her dispatch a penitential piece of policy , which will bring all round again .
This same Mrs. LA MOTTE is in a state of widowhood , and much in love with her weeds - a great beauty - and , I see by one of her letters , ( which I dissimulated out of HARRIET , ) a great boaster .
I furthermore understand , that she is a constant church-goer , has a deliciously  demure set of muscles , an elevated pair of eyes , - folds the fair palm , and holds long conversations betwixt GOD and her conscience .


Now , THORNTON , if , by setting all my master-maxims in motion - if , by either the aids of genius , stratagem , and every exerted OMNIPOTENCY of the head , heart , hand , and voice , I could but lower the loftiness of this proud-hearted cottager , my soul would be satisfied , and I should sacrifice to the shade of the invincible DORMER , such a victim as might soothe his spirit , and elevate his extacy in elysium .
- At present this is in embrio only , - uningendered .
- In all events , I am determined , as KING LEAR says ,


- To do something !
What it is yet I know not , But it shall strike the world , c.  Genius of STANHOPE , assist me !
- breathe into thy Pupil instant inspiration !
- exalt my thought !
- animate me !
- give me to bend the imperious heart of the confident LA MOTTE !
Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 I HAVE only a minute to spare , and that is to tell thee , I am the dullest dolt that Nature ever produced .


That nobody might perceive my agitation of mind , by my countenance , and its treacherous changings , I have rambled amongst the rocks and over the heathy hills of this execrable country , to meditate upon the means of bringing LA MOTTE within the reach of my machinations .
- It is not to be done , and in the perfect stupidity , and shame of my soul , I am compelled to suspend the pursuit .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 WRITE to me , my dear LA MOTTE , though it be but to say - HARRIET , I do not hate you : you have my pity and my prayers .


HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 THE matter of LA MOTTE must rest : I can not hit it off  but have , indeed , other affairs to mind .
This HARRIET answers all my joyous purposes most delightfully while I am heating the fire for the tender FANNY , who , I understand , is much better , and is to be seen ( if the sun is not afraid of being outshone tomorrow ) to examine the bath .
Accident will , no doubt , contrive for me to be in view , about the moment of her first appearance .
Her husband - but of him hereafter .


 Postscript .


HARRIET HOMESPUN wants capacity  I am obliged to dictate her letters to this Mrs. LA MOTTE , who must be kept in with , now she is in the secret .


Adieu .


PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THERE is nothing , saith my creed , ` so delicate as a man 's moral character , and nothing which it is so much his interest to preserve pure . '
- I have been at church , THORNTON , where HOMESPUN officiated as teacher .
He hath a snuffle in his nose  his voice is destitute of that harmonious variety , essential to all sorts of eloquence  and his organs of articulation , appear considerably obstructed .


However , I took him by the hand , upon his descending from the pulpit  returned him my sincere thanks , in a  well-invented compliment , for the elegance of his discourse  applauded his delivery  lamented that I had not often been made so happy  and almost brought the tears of virtue and vanity , into the good man 's eyes , at the pathos of my conclusion .


`` There is no living in the world , '' you know , THORNTON , ` without a complaisant indulgence for peoples weaknesses . '
In a short time , I expect to reach the summit  for , after only an hour 's practice , I found myself able to call out a palpable tear , only by placing a chair before my face , and , by the force of imagination , representing it as a certain person in distress , which I had an interest in relieving .


And now I am talking upon the subject of sympathy , I must tell thee , THORNTON , that I have made myself still more  popular than ever in this little place , by several acts of unostentatious ostentation - by giving occasional small sums to people , who make it utterly unnecessary for me to be my own trumpeter .
There are a set of characters that will raise a benefactor 's reputation , without any drudgery on his side : these people have tongue enough , however poor they may be in other respects  and all the good you do , though silent and secret as the noon of night , shall shine like ` the light that shineth unto the perfect day , ' by means of those same grateful gossips .


Adieu , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 ONCE more , receive an account of a tender transaction , which I can not conceal from thee .
Relating upon paper , to the friend of one 's heart , ( for such thou art to me , ) any business , or event , that hath afforded transport , is an office of a pleasing kind .


HARRIET , is as richly formed by Nature for rapture , as ever was woman  and will , I am in hopes , soon be an adept in the science of pleasing .
Her person is voluptuous , beyond painting , and the joys it yields are only to be felt  and yet , I am almost reduced again to childishness ,  and am almost ready to fall again into my leading-string notions by a very puerile accident - even , THORNTON , by the love-tale of a green , uninformed girl , whose whole history I purchased for a single sixpence .
She hath been ruined and undone , as she terms it , by the basest of men .
- And who dost thou think that man is , THORNTON ?
- Neither more nor less than my fellow THOMAS , who is , I 'll assure thee , a would-be STANHOPEAN : but , trusting merely to picked-up precepts - the very crumbs that have fallen from his master 's table - he stumbles in the effort , and discovers his livery , his dependency , and his education , even in his amours .
All this , I enjoy , thou knowest .
- The forsaken nymph came to complain of my Mr. THOMAS .
She is very pretty , and very loquacious  but hear the story in her own words .


52.1 .
THE STORY OF THE PRETTY BATH-MAID .


 A N'T please your Honour , I am but a servant , and live , by handing my water to gentryfolks .
I have tended the well-side , since BUXTON bath became famush  and nobody 's tumbler was oftener filled than mine .
Till the week before last , I was the happiest water-wench that ever dipt her glass in the well : all the qallety knew me , all the ladies loved me , and all the gentlemen quarrelled which should drink first  but matters are now altered , and I am asheamed to take my stand at the place , because of the baseness of your Honour 's unhonest Mr. THOMAS .


The arts he has used to tangle me , and take away my wartue , are monstrous , and such , as would make the stoutest she  in the country stumble .
I am sure , for my part , I stood it , till I could stand it no longer .
If your Honour will hear me out , and do me justis , seeing as my character is gone , and therewithal my water , and with that my bread , so that I have now neither bread nor water , I will unfold every-thing , and let your Goodness see the affair from top to bottom .


Poor girl , sit down , sit down  I am sorry for the loss of your water , with all my heart , and shall very chearfully see as much of the affair , as you drink proper to shew me - Sit down , therefore , child , and shew away .


You must know , Sir , as how , when bathing and drinking the waters is over , and your Honour and such-like fine folk are all busy a-dancing  we servant-people , sometimes get together to a lesserrer room ,  and have a little hop of our own .
This happened the very first night I saw Mr. THOMAS , who I observed , soon after he came into town , walk round the well , and then backwards and forwards  and , to be sure , there was something in his putting his foot to the ground , taking it off again , swinging his arm , flourishing his switch , and saluting the fellow-servants , that made him look a king to the rest .


Well , Sir , he chus'd me for his partner  and tho ' I say it , I can shake a foot with my betters  nay , at a country-dance , I 'll turn my back neither to gentle nor simple .


If your Honour had heard the highfliers he crammed my poor head with , all the while we were at it - the soft things he said , while we led out - the wows he made , as we handed up the middle - and  the tender oaths and rodermuntadoes he swore , while we right and left handed it , or cast off , and joined hands again - while at the same time the music struck up enough to melt one 's heart - with candles lighted , and i ' the summer-season - your Honour would not blame me so much for giving away my soul and body to the most artfullest of his sect .


In short , Sir , he talkt me over so finely about this and that , that before I left the room , and we broke up , I did not know whether I stood upon my head or my heels .


After dancing was over , and Mr. THOMAS and I had made ourselves all of a heat , or , as I remembers he called it , all of an ardor , we took a walk in the grove by the hall , to cool ourselves .
And there he began to flourish it again - overpowered  me with such an ocean of love-sayings , and , in short , talked so different from my old sweetheart ROGER DOUSIT , who is all dull and downright , as I may say , that I declares to your Honour , he at last made me think it would be a sin to refuse him  and so - God forgive me !
- and so -


And so - you did not refuse , hey ?
Is that it ?
-


Here the poor girl drew out her handkerchief , and had sincerely a very great occasion for it .


She told me , in a tone , THORNTON , that touched me , that if , notwithstanding what THOMAS said , she had been wicked , she was a ruined woman , that was all - that it might do very well for gentlefolks to play false with one another , because they had got wherewithal to wash all white  again  but that a black spot in a poor woman , who pended on her water - was never to be rubbed out : - that , moreover , the news had some-how got air , and she was pointed at by all the ill-natured fingers in the place .
She said , with astonishing simplicity , that the man fairly overset her with his new-fangled gibberish - but that she found 't was all over with her .
She added , that , for her own part , she did not so much mind it , as she could turn her hand to any-thing , and would leave the town in a twinkle  but that she had an old mother , that had been bedridden these eight months , who lived at FAIRFIELD , and who must now want bread as well as herself .
Nay , for that matter , said the girl , she 'll soon be provided for , if she hears of my slip , without troubling the parish  for I shall soon break her heart : I shall soon send my  poor old mother out of the world  for she is a good woman , Sir , and would sooner bury me than see me what I am now .
DOUSIT will turn up his nose at me now  and without your Honour makes Mr. THOMAS do me justis , so as that I may become honest again , and do it in the lawful way - God only knows what course I must take ?


She now dropt her tears , THORNTON , as fast , to use the language of SHAKESPEARE ,


As the Arabian tree Its medicinal gum .
At this very moment THOMAS came in with a message on which he had been dispatched .
What is it , THORNTON , what cursed troublesome thing is it , at once invisible ,  and audacious , that lodges in our bosoms beyond reach of our revenge , to make the stoutest of us children and cowards ?


Never did GARRICK exhibit , or SHAKESPEARE describe , such a look , and attitude , as that of poor TOM at his entrance , on observing so unexpected an object .


He stammered , he staggered , he turned white , and attempted to retreat .


I commanded him to stay  and , taking my sword from the hook , gave him his choice , and one that might have puzzled a much wiser man - either to die or marry .
Fear operated even so strong , as to make him chuse the latter .


He fell on his knees , and would have entered into explanations .
I would not  hear them .
- The ceremony that HAMLET uses with his quondam friends now passed between us , and I made them both swear upon my sword .


I promised them a dower - the woman was in extacy , and paid me , by such a look of gratitude , that , had REYNOLDS been there , he would have made the water-wench immortal by drawing it .


I am above altercation : of this THOMAS is aware .
Nay , I believe , he likes the girl .
- They shall be united as soon as possible : and what the devil can be the reason , that I am more happy in putting these two people together , than all the joys I ever tasted with the exquisite and yielding HARRIET , I can not tell .


 Were it not that I have contrived , as usual , to get HORACE out of the way , and that I never break an assignation , I should certainly avoid seeing her , or any body else , this evening .
- Is not this unaccountable ?
But so it is .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THE story of thy bath-maid interested me strangely  and I have felt the more pleasure in giving it a tear , because I perceive it hath penetrated even the almost invulnerable PHILIP SEDLEY .


But how thou art able to stand the shock of so many radient eyes , and yielded charms , - wrapt round and round as thou art in the elysium of voluntary and voluptuous embraces - a young fellow of spirit too - is , to me , most unaccountably mysterious .
- In defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine DORMER - in defiance of all empiricism - I  should certainly break out , and even at the risque of overturning the whole well-woven web of gallantry , dwindle into a downright inamerato , and quite lose the subtle distinction betwixt simulation and laudible insincerity .


And so thou hadst the supreme of transport , in uniting thy faithless footman to the beautiful bath-maid !


I 'll tell thee what , SEDLEY , - thou art - ( if thou wilt allow me for once the coinage of a new word ) - thou art but half CHESTERFIELDED .
- The impression made upon thee by the pale face of the conscious THOMAS - the pleasure thou hadst at wiping away the drops of penitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of simplicity - and thy wishing to soliloquise , and be excused , even from the arms of the tempting and married HARRIET  - are all symptoms totally unstanhopean ( there 's another word for thee ) .


Take care , SEDLEY : thou art upon the eve of a relapse - a relapse in favour , not of DORMER , but of down-right DOUSIT 'S single-dealing .


And yet , my friend , shall I once again confess to you my infirmity - my unestablishment in the maxims of thy Preceptor ?
- I can not blame thy weaknesses , nor can I - however destructive they may be to thy system - avoid wishing thou mayst continue thy present tendencies , especially as , by thy own honest confession , thou hast found more gratification in them , than in supporting the toilsome task of eternal disingenuity .


Nor ought I , indeed , to call this a weakness in me .
If to be happy is the  ultimatum of all earthly pursuits - if it is equally the effort of every different order of men , it assuredly follows , that that conduct is the most rational by which the greatest share of felicity is procured .
The closest application of human wit and wisdom can do no more than point out to thee the most solid degree of joy , and it matters not whether that joy is obtained by the practice of one system or another .


The last action thou hast recorded ( I allude to the promised nuptials of thy bath-maid ) was evidently agreeable to the sentiments of SENECA , SOCRATES , and all the wise and good men both of the East and West  and since the precepts of STANHOPE have been unable to give thee a superior , or even an equal felicity , how proper and consistent with right reason is it in me , to advise thee to walk  in that path wherein thou hast found the most pleasure ?
Laugh not - ridicule not , I beseech thee : thou art not , I hope , so much a tool to the taste of the times - so much a dupe to prejudiced opinions - as to dislike even the balance of bliss which is now in thy favour , merely because the scale hath been turned by a worthy action - that would be insanity .


To love duplicity , and certain sophistical distinctions , merely for the sake of double-dealing , and when plain , clear , clean , uncrooked honesty will answer thy purpose much better , is at once ridiculous and diabolical .


On the whole , therefore , I advise thee , in the deliberation of my heart , to substitute the aforesaid SENECA , or some other systematical moralist , instead of STANHOPE  and to lay him quickly  aside in a corner of thy trunk , as unqualified to confer the comfort he professes to administer .


And , indeed , SEDLEY , to open my whole soul to thee , I must own thee , that I very much suspect his Lordship 's sentiments .
Even in my occasional dealings here in Town , since thy departure , I have not been able to make them bear the test quite to my satisfaction : such , especially , as relate to the suduction of the tender sex .
I made a slight experiment , no longer ago than last night , of his most favourite maxim , namely , to taste the joys of security , mingled in embraces  and yet , though I do not think I conducted myself unadroitly , it did not altogether answer the satisfaction he predicted to result from it


Thou art not a stranger to the elegancies  of SOPHIA VERNON , the new-married wife of the man whose promotion from ensign to lieutenant it was our joint endeavour , some time ago , to effect : his gratitude is still - ` tremblingly alive all o'er  ' and , by a natural consequence , he is without the least tincture of suspicion , and esteems every instance of particular enquiry after his wife , or friend , as a mark of generosity in his benefactor .


This leaves the way to an intimacy with his SOPHIA fair and unobstructed  and she has already caught so much of the Lieutenant 's enthusiasm , that she pays me the tribute of a rosy-red blush of acknowledgment as often as I approach her .
They have lately purchased a pretty cottage , amidst the vernal beauties of SURRY : it is surrounded by gardens , not cittish , but genteel : there are no nudities ,  no monstrous urns , no fantastical fountains , no chubby cherubims , no tiptoed Mercury 's , smirking Venusses , nor spruce holly-hedges : 't is all ` true Nature to advantage dressed  ' the verdure is voluptuous , the flower-beds well weeded , the shrubbery gratefully shaded , and the alcove smiles upon the Thames .


Within this alcove I yesterday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of SOPHIA , whose husband had invited me pressingly , to make the solitude of his lady more social by my company , as he was himself under the necessity of taking a journey into SUSSEX .


As you love brooks and books , hills and rills , my dear Mr. THORNTON , said he , smilingly , you and SOPHY will be able to pass away your time to your mutual satisfaction , till the return of your friend .


 Poor , unsuspicious pair !


They united their entreaties , and prevailed : Lieutenant VERNON set out , and left to thy friend ( in trust ) the most beautiful property upon the banks of the THAMES .
In a word , he began his journey in the fragrant coolness of yesterday 's evening , and I was left at full liberty to abuse the confidence he placed in my integrity , and , in return for his hospitality , do my utmost to destroy the chastity of her , whom he doats upon with the sincerest tenderness .


The tear which she dropt upon his hand as she kissed it , at parting , drew from him another , accompanied by such a look , as defies either tongue , pen , or pencil , and went at the time so close to my heart , that I could not but imagine the passion betwixt two , was more exquisite  than if it were divided betwixt two-and-twenty .
One man and one woman , thought I , may certainly be happier than a Sultan  and I had rather possess the real , undissimulated love of a SOPHIA VERNON , than command the keys of the seraglio .


SOPHIA remained pensive , and sighed after the travelling Lieutenant .


I examined the little library for a book to entertain her .
CHESTERFIELD was there , but I did not think it a proper book to read , as I would wish to keep the maxims as far out of the sight of a female as possible : for when a woman is told the secret of her seduction , she will naturally be upon her guard against the seducer  and , really , STANHOPE unfolds the art with such perspicuity , that she who runs may read  nay  even thy  footman comprehends the whole system , and hath , according to thy account , ruined his woman with a very tolerable address .


By the by , SEDLEY , I have to accuse thee of two weak pieces of conduct .
The first is , thy rashness in trusting the epistles of thy Preceptor to the flighty HARRIET , who might have heedlessly shewn them to HORACE , by which means ( as thou art a very striking commentary upon the chapters of CHESTERFIELD ) he would have had a clue to the original sources of thy present conduct  and a detection of this kind would have been totally insupportable .
Thy other fault is , thy carelessness , and , I might say , want of policy , in exposing the volumes which thou so pretendest to venerate , to the plebeian eyes of thy valet .
Lock them up , I pray thee , for the time to come  and if  thou art resolved to proceed in reducing them to practice , do it privately .


In regard to SOPHIA , my endeavours to divert her thoughts from the beloved subject of their contemplation , were in vain : the Lieutenant mingled in every idea , and she had passions , sighs , sentiments , and sensations , only for Mr. VERNON .
I recited to her an elegy from HAMMOND , and she wept , in the sincerity of her heart , over images so amiable , and so similar to those now suggested by her own situation .
I wished to divert her , by reading to her the oddities of corporal Trim , and uncle Toby : but she was in no disposition to be delighted with the whimsical strokes of a fine , but irregular wit .
I even adverted to the irresistible sallies of HARRY FIELDING , and displayed to her the master-piece of narrative , in the laughable  scene of Parson ADAMS pursued by the hounds and hunters .
She was proof even against this , and afforded it only a faint smile .
She then tried what a walk in the garden would do : she criticised the colours of the tulips , and descanted with moral delicacy on the pleasing progress of vegetable Nature  but , alas !
even here a sigh would break in upon her remark , and very evidently convince me , that Pope was not so romantic in the pastoral sentiment , which observes , ` Absence is surely death to those who love . '
In short , SEDLEY , whatever might be the temptation before me , and however assiduous I was to gratify it , it was not now the moment to begin the attack  and every-thing I said , only served to shew me more plainly , that , if I would wish to please her , it must be by talking warmly of a man , whom it was my interest to wean from her affections .
 Perceiving this , I gave way to sympathy , and most cordially united my tears to hers , and joined in the most animated encomiums on her happy Lieutenant .
These tears , however , SEDLEY , and those praises , gave me a soothing softness not to be described , and made me feel a thousand times more agreeable than while I repressed them , in the hope of turning my thoughts to the husband 's dishonour , and the wife 's destruction .
Is not this , SEDLEY , a parallel case to that of thine ?
If thou wert more happy at doing a just action to thy bath-maid , than at an unjust one , by undoing the lively HARRIET  I am more happy at having conquered an inclination , which would have tormented my own fancy , tortured a `` generous , trusting friend , '' and agonized the bosom of a woman , whose reputation is at present unsuspected , and unpolluted .


 Hence then , my dear SEDLEY , it appears , that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a similar sensation - a sensation created by the social virtues , and derived purely from the felicity of others .
Upon this subject I have but one point to observe : it is , to continue the triumph .
Let us even cherish a transport , which is superior to any that dissimulation can give : let us throw away the perplexing mask of the casuistical CHESTERFIELD : let us walk in the right way , and since it hath already rewarded us so well , let us prefer truth to falsehood , and honesty to hypocrisy : for , believe me , my dear , dear SEDLEY , under whatever name we may distinguish vice and virtue , they remain eternally the same , and neither sophistry , nor subtlety , nor fashion , nor the sanctified follies of the mode , can possibly palliate the atrociousness of the one , or detract from the native excellence of the other .
PENMEN may puzzle , PHILOSOPHERS  may refine , POETS may colour , and visionaries may suggest as they please , but , while the traces of Nature remain , virtue will be fair , and vice deformed  and , in my opinion , that man 's maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible , who , in the same volume , nay , sometimes in the same epistle , inculcates a delicate regard to moral character , and an attack upon those human weaknesses , from the humouring of which ( assisted by a proper mixture of well-applied flattery ) we are to prey upon each other , to prepare ourselves for deceit , and , if the system were general , introduce , by these means , even while we sanctify them , the most dangerous delusions .
For my part , SEDLEY , I tell thee again , and again , that I find a flaw in thy STANHOPE , and shall read him , for the future , with the eye of a severe critic , and not an idolater - not a PHILIP SEDLEY .


Farewel .
J. THORNTON .


 THE ceremony has been performed .
I insisted on its being done in the face of the congregation , I gave THOMAS a purse for his wedding-dinner , and so the poor wench is again made an honest woman .


Never heard I panegyrics more warm or better circulated than those reverberated from lip to lip upon this occasion  and I could almost bless the fellow for a debauchery , that hath added such lustre to my character .
I am the very ballad of  the bath  and the negligence which I seem to pay to the praises , only serves to increase , and make me appear more deserving of them .
But what a simpleton I was , in yielding to the baby sensation which seized me unawares in my last .
To do good is , indeed , pleasing , and I will on that principle continue to do it as occasion invites  but Is there not an higher motive , thou wilt say , than this ?
- Is there not religion ?
Pshaw !
-


Yes , pious THORNTON , there is a higher motive .
It flatters the senses , it gratifies vanity , it procures eclat , it promotes conquest , it extends our triumph over a sex that was born for our amusement .
- The trifling action just recorded , backed by a few more that I have not patience to recite , hath made me so popular amongst all ranks of people in this village , from my Lady in her bathing-shift , to her attendants  of the towel , that I defy anything but my own folly to mark me as an object of suspicion .


I have established my reputation , THORNTON , upon the solid basis of virtuous actions  I have decorated the superstructure , with the graces of conduct  and now , no man will dare to imagine this goodly edifice is but a whitened sepulchre .
Possibly thou mayst imagine , that I have earned my pleasures by difficult adoption of the STANHOPEAN system .
No , THORNTON , I have a taste for them .
I do not ` inflict excesses upon myself , because I think them genteel , ' but I find these pursuits ` guard me against frivolousness , ' and prevent me ` from throwing away upon trifles , that time , which only important things deserve . '
In a word , I tell thee once more , I view the Lord of my Idolatry only as a man  more skilled than myself , in the arts of being truly happy : and in this light he deserves my everlasting gratitude  for he hath taught me ` to make every place I go to , the scene of quick and lively transports  to let every company I frequent , gratify my passions  to know the true value of time  and to snatch , seize , and enjoy every moment of it . '


Of this enough : the remainder of my letter shall be dedicated to the delicious purpose of recording several events , which have fallen out , by the joint effort of destiny and contrivance , since my last .


I have had a second glance at the delicate but decaying features of FANNY .
Tempted by the chearfulness of the morning , she ventured , under the supporting arms of a husband , and sister , to walk from her lodgings to the bathing-house .
 She saw me , but drew away her eye , and never directed it towards me again .
Her husband bowed to me , as to the polite stranger , who had interested himself so much in the welfare of his beloved : the sister inclined her head , and curtesy'd more than civilly - it was the bend , rather of attention , than ceremony .


At this moment , many a lank-haired swain , yet humid with the bath , and a cluster of women , still glowing from the immersion , appeared in view .
They were instantly attracted by the meteor , gazed , envied , and passed on .
Well , indeed , might they gaze - well might they envy , THORNTON : the rose again emulates the lilly , in her cheek  the blue is like the blue of the elements  her arm , is animated alabaster  and the hand , to which it belongs , is shaped to inspire by its appearance , and enfever by its touch .


 After this , as she was preparing to return , a servant came hastily to inform Mr. MORTIMER , that Sir HENRY DELMORE was arrived .
They quickened their pace a little  even FANNY attempted to step briskly , but failed in the effort .
The good Baronet was impatient , and ( eager to behold his children ) came forward in his boots to meet them .


Oh , THORNTON , what a figure !
- how noble !
how venerable !
how fashionable !
- But , alas !
all surprizes , even those of the most pleasing kind , are too much for the feeble situation of FANNY .
Her father soon saw her confusion , softened it by a paternal kiss , and assisted in conducing her home to her lodgings .
In something less than an hour , I received the inclosed  which is the luckiest incident in the world to me , and which , by  the time this reaches you , I hope to improve to some purpose .


HARRIET HOMESPUN is fonder of me , and better bred to HORACE , than ever .
She has a wonderful aptitude to learn , and will in time be , no doubt , a female STANHOPE .
What a lucky thing it is for us , that HORACE hath so great an appetite for a long walk by himself after dinner !
and how infinitely is he , and indeed ought he to be , obliged to me , for administering so much consolation to his wife in his absence !


Surely , THORNTON , there is nothing so grateful as serving a friend .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 Sir ,


I AM made truly happy , at least as much so as the present situation of my family will admit , to hear that I am again likely to be honoured by the company of a gentleman , to whose society I am already indebted for so much pleasure .
It is no small addition , Sir , to this pleasing expectation , to find that the many friendly enquiries that have from time to time  been made , concerning the health of my poor FANNY , proceeded from the very man to whom the father of that beautiful invalid owed so many agreeable hours at SCARBOROUGH .


But how ceremonious was it , Mr. SEDLEY , that you should all this while have estranged yourself , and appeared only in the light of a person interested in the fate of the sick , but not allied to the parent of that dear unfortunate , by any closer or warmer reciprocations of a former friendship ?


I know , for my part , of but one way to excuse this punctilious behaviour , and that is , your embracing the first hour of your leisure to join your hand with that of , Sir ,


Your most obedient , and most humble servant , H. DELMORE .


 Dear Doctor ,


WHAT can possibly be the reason of your so long silence ?
I now want your advice on a momentous subject .


The time of my sojourning at this watering-place is expired , my curacy can no longer be deserted , and I must return to it at all events on Saturday , or the duty of the Sabbath must be neglected .


Notwithstanding this , Mrs. HOMESPUN  again complains of her ancle , and says the anguish of it is now got higher than her knee  and she is , therefore , resolved to undergo the operation of pumping upon the part affected , by which means I shall be obliged to leave her behind , or else bring her away much against her own choice  which , notwithstanding my want of faith as to the knee and ancle , I do not think myself entitled to do , seeing that she hath demeaned herself most cordially .
The fact is , she is quite in love with the frivolous pleasures of this puerile place , in which , were it not for the instructive and entertaining conversations of my friend SEDLEY , I should not be able to support its customs .
As my wife , however , seems resolved , I have thought of an expedient to supply my absence for a few days longer .
HARRIET hath a friend in our neighbourhood - a Mrs. LA MOTTE - who is a very discreet , sensible ,  and judicious widow-woman , and who , I am persuaded , will not only do me the service of passing a few days at the bath , but likewise urge all the arguments of which she is mistress , to wean the affections of her friend from this circle of vanity , and reduce her once more to the standard of common-sense , and the serene pleasures of a country-village .


I want your council , my dear DOCTOR , on the following subject .
Mr. SEDLEY has applied in my favour to the Bishop of - , respecting the living of - , which is worth near 200l .
per annum .
Mr. SEDLEY is in hourly expectation of a reply to this , and I am already so overwhelmed with the kindnesses of this worthy gentleman , ( who hath done them in a manner peculiar to his character , ) that I am in doubt whether I ought to increase a debt it will be ever beyond my  ability to discharge .
HARRIET 'S little fortunes , united to the profits of my curacy , are sufficient to the purposes of a contented mind .
My parsonage , you know , DOCTOR , is in the very bosom of a beautiful wood , through which I have been accustomed to ramble with a social classic in my hand  my parishioners love me  the little garden is of my own cultivation  I turned the arch , and twisted the woodbines around my bower with my own fingers  the birds are protected , and nest with me in perfect security  and if I could but once make HARRIET in love with it again , I believe I should not quit it without a sigh .
But one circumstance weighs with me .
I have the dear prospect of a successor : to it I owe an interest I should not feel for myself .
HARRIET is very far advanced in her pregnancy .
A child , my dear friend , enlarges the wishes of a father : a tear is ready to  fall on my letter , as I think upon the increase of my family .
To his offspring a man owes every thing .
Tell me then , dear DIGGORY , what I must do .


Farewel .
I am yours , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 THE plot begins to thicken , and the catastrophe only demands good contrivance to be made delightful .
HORACE HOMESPUN goes away from the bath today , in order to mount the rostrum , and preach up the good old cause to-morrow  HARRIET will be all this evening with me alone , left wholly to my kindness  and , to crown the whole , the scheme is at last laid to bring the haughty-hearted LA MOTTE within the reach , of my machinations .
If there needs any further addition to these felicities , know , THORNTON , that I am hand and glove with Sir HENRY DELMORE , and hand and heart , I  shall soon be , with FANNY MORTIMER  the enchanting DELIA looks not with eye inverted , and MORTIMER himself hath made advances to intimacy .
Under these circumstances thou wilt not expect that I can attend to thy long epistolary sermon , which I herewith re-inclose thee for a present to the parson of thy parish , against the death of Mrs. ARABELLA , thy grandam , when it will afford many admirable hints for the funeral oration of that pious and puritanical old lady .


Whenever thou sendest such a string of common-place proverbs , depend upon receiving them again , and always with the charge of double postage .
So take the hint , and thank me for the warning .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 WHAT an additional degree of happiness do I feel , since I last wrote to my beloved Lady LUCY ?
My father is arrived , my sister is recovering , and we are become acquainted with a man whose company is at once pleasing , instructive , and various .
The very gentleman , my dear LUCY , who hath so frequently sent his polite cards of enquiry concerning FANNY , proves to be a man of birth , rank , and character , and well-known both to Sir HENRY , and Mr. MORTIMER , when they were last season at the bath of SCARBOROUGH .
He is  the most well-bred and complaisant character in the world , and has , at the first interview , all the ease , firmness , and unembarrassed air of an old acquaintance .
The assured , yet modest manner with which he presents himself to a company , shews plainly that he has been long accustomed to fashionable societies , and would charm you .
If FANNY continues to recover , we shall be once more a joyful family - my mother is also down with us .


We have taken part of a very elegant house , only a short ride from the company , about three miles distant from BUXTON , and it stands upon a spot infinitely less bleak and barren than the uncomfortable-looking mountains that surround the bath .
I received the welcome epistle , dear LUCY , in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of absence , in a correspondence of wisdom , wit , sentiment ,  and affection : but does not my fair friend forget that the requisites to form and to continue such an intercourse , are not at the command of every scribbler , though the partiality of Nature , and the polish of high-breeding , may confer them on herself ?
However , since you are so earnest with me , I will pour out my soul imperfectly upon paper , and though I may be wanting in point of elegance , or accuracy , the deficiencies will be compensated by a frankness of mind , and an undisguise of sentiment , that will pay a better compliment to my LUCY 'S candour , than all that could possibly be bestowed by the flowers of rhetoric , or colourings of the imagination .


I the more readily yield to your urgencies , my LUCY , as my pen , at this period , can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtuous and endearing .


 It is said , indeed , that mankind have always some fantastical and visionary scheme in view .
I declare to you , Lady SAXBY , that the perfect restoration of FANNY 'S health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our domestic joy .
Judge yourself !
for the visible alteration of Mrs. MORTIMER for the better , hath put me into such spirits , that I can not restrain my gratitude to the dear personages by which those spirits are inspired .
Take then , my beloved LUCY , the sketch of a family-picture , drawn ( and yet not partially ) by the pencil of a relation .


The first , and principal figure in this group is , a father , whose mind is the repository of every virtue - a repository in which he has been , from hour to hour , in the career of almost threescore years , laying up something valuable , till he hath at length stored it with every excellence   with all , LUCY , that can give worth to the husband , softness to the parent , solidity to the friend , benevolence to the neighbour , and humanity to the man : to which is added , a universal attention to the wants , and complaints , the fortunes , and morals of that prodigious body of men to which he is related only by sameness of species , and the conscious ties of the christian and fellow-creature .


The second leading object in the piece is a mother , the model of her husband  and differing only , by adapting the manly virtues to a delicacy more consistent with the refinement and gentleness of the female character , and nature .


The third figure , to which I would direct your observation , is , the still lovely FANNY MORTIMER , - a woman whom even the depredations of four lingering  months , passed in the languors of sickness , have not rendered unattracting .
To a spirit at once wise and worthy , she superadds the finest politeness , gentleness uncommon , and meekness peculiar to her : and to these , again , are joined a taste elegant and simple - an understanding enlarged and cultivated , - and a face , in defiance of distemper , in which Heaven seems to have painted an attribute in every feature : her eye sparkles benignity , her lips are the temples of truth , her cheeks are the emblems of modesty veiled in roses , and her hands were formed by the Graces to the best of purposes - to charm , by their liberality , the wretched into peace , and to be ( consistently with their colour ) the pure and beautiful stewards of a heart tender as a turtle 's , yet solid as a sage 's .


The husband of this enchanting creature , is the brother of Lady SAXBY , the  very counter-part of his sister , and the very youth whom Sir HENRY DELMORE adopted as the child of his affection , undertook for several years the direction of his education , supplied the loss of a father , trained him up for his own , and at last gave him , all-accomplished , to the only woman that could deserve him - his daughter .
His character is recorded in most of the European courts  and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for me to say , that he has been every where distinguished , for bravery without rashness , honour without ancestral pride , elegance without vanity , affection without interestedness , and generosity without ostentation .


Such , LUCY , are the outlines of a picture now under the eye of your friend .
Your absence , however , and FANNY 'S uncertain state of health , are the two dark  clouds that overcast my otherwise radiant horizon .


In some measure , however , to atone for these indispensible drawbacks , I can now promise an often-repeated intercourse , in which , through the kind medium of the post , our pleasures , with those of our families , shall be reciprocated - But - in the the name of extravagance , where am I rambling - and what a metaphorical rhapsody am I going to send ?
Let me hasten then to assure you , that in all dispositions of mind , I am , with a tenderness peculiar to the truth of my attachment ,


Your affectionate , DELIA DELMORE .


 THE Fates , surely , are busied in contriving matters precisely as I would have them .


The DELMORE 'S are removed to a villa at some distance from BUXTON , by which means I shall be able to prevent opposite interests from clashing with each other .
- I prithee , THORNTON , mark my policy , to which I have , even at the age of thirty , sacrificed my passion .
Knowing the little scandals and fugitive whispers of a watering-place , I practised upon myself the STANHOPEAN self-denial , and have not been a single minute alone with HARRIET  since the departure of HORACE .
I contrive to call in , either the loquacious landlord , or chattering landlady , and only conversed , in their own way , upon topics too trivial to send thee one hundred and sixty miles  but which answered very well my purpose : for , strange as it may seem to thee , I hold it not good policy , or right reason , to have a tete-a-tete with a wife , when her husband is known to have left the town  nor am I very well pleased with the incautious HARRIET , for suffering herself to be deserted , and exposed to the report , and murder of the moment  for in these places , where detraction is a necessary filler-up of the vacuum , ` At ev'ry word a reputation dies . '
And I would not be thought a libertine , either in thought , word , or deed , for the universe .
'T is expressly , and flagrantly ,  against my system , which , thou knowest , places the very perfection of human nature , and the height of human abilities , in `` being upon our own guard , and yet , by a seeming natural openness , to put people off theirs . ''


Now , in cases of amour , it is , in conformity to this principle , absolutely necessary , that a husband should be upon the premises , though not upon the spot  otherwise there is no possibility of avoiding mystery  and mystery occasions suspicion , and suspicion opens a door to detection , and detection ruins me for ever .
The ordinary rake , thou knowest , piques himself upon this , nay , circulates it at the expence of his truth :


He talks of transports that he never knew , And fancies raptures that he never felt .
 But the pupils of CHESTERFIELD are not such `` rude , vain-glorious boasters . ''
They are to preserve their moral sanctity , even in the midst of ( what gownsmen call ) violation , not only of good report , but , like the purity of Caesar 's wife , unsuspected .
Oh !
may this ingenuity and well-acted dissimulation ever keep me from being blown upon  and , to this end , may I never withdraw the dear veil that keeps me apparently pure , one moment from my heart !
May I ever possess the ingenuous exterior , with the reserved interior  may I never reject , as troublesome , or useless , the mastery of my temper  and , above all other things , may I always possess myself enough to hear , and see , every thing , without any visible change of countenance !
May no man living ever be able to decypher the secret of my heart  and yet , may  I keep the key of every other heart in the universe : and , to conclude my prayer , let Hypocrisy place before me her shield , under which I may fight my foolish antagonist , for ever guarded , and for ever victorious !


And indeed , THORNTON , I perceive , the adroitest practice of these several points , suggested by the matchless DORMER , will be shortly necessary , for never did I enter so sagacious , or so uniformly amiable a family as that of the DELMORES .


The principal of it ( Sir HENRY ) is so acute , so adorned , so read , so experienced , that he must , I perceive , be deceived with a delicacy even beyond the deceptions of Belial : and I wonder I did not lay myself open to discovery when at SCARBOROUGH , at a time that I was a novice in  the ways of STANHOPE , and could not be supposed to copy him , liberally .
But , my good genius preserved me , and I engaged the hand of the father , and struck hard upon the tender heart of his daughter .


Then there 's a formidable husband in my way - no HORACE HOMESPUN - but a man of travel , experience , taste - A second sister , too - the lively DELIA - a wit , a corresponder , a perfect pen-woman  and , to close the list , a venerable matron - wise - virtuous - penetrating - the lady president of this bewitching association .


What of that ?
If they are not versed ( as I believe they are not ) in my maxims , I may be a match for all of them : pass like a meteor through this difficult hemisphere - kindle as I go - and dread no radiant competitor .


 As to HARRIET - the affair is over : nothing is left even for the exercise of my talents : the precept by which I obtained her , has been successful in practice : all that remains , is ITERATION .
Her fondness grows luxuriant , and she may betray me .
To confess the truth , THORNTON - I am indifferent to her , and I wish HORACE had her , locked in his arms to eternity , with all my soul .


At all events , she must not entertain such ardent expectations - for - I am summoned elsewhere - a scene of greater difficulty , greater delicacy , and greater delight , expands itself before me - the half-conquered - half-expiring FANNY MORTIMER , who must not descend unenjoyed by SEDLEY to the earth - The worm , THORNTON , must not be suffered to riot on her beauties : 'twould be a pity - a profanation !
 The exquisite and vivacious DELIA , also , attracts my notice .
I am called to the combat , and I must exert every nerve to triumph in the combat , of which the laurels will be trebly precious , since I perceive they must be earned with all the artillery of manner , address , and assurance .


In pursuance of these objects , I shall probably be often animated into the wish of enjoyments , that , it may be impolitic , to push too far , till every thing is ripe for the coup de grace .


In such exigences , it is difficult to keep the rein in my hand : the warmth of imagination , and an acquaintance with objects , and situations , calculated to fire it , seem inconsistent with the necessary coolness , and command of my temper .
 To provide , therefore , against these moments of ardour , I shall , if LA MOTTE comes down , retain the enamoured HARRIET in my train , as the agreeable resource from the agitations in which it is likely I shall be thrown by the charms , delays , or impediments , of the DELMORES .
Possibly , too , something may fall out to reduce LA MOTTE , which , be her personal endowments what they may , is desirable  because she is prepared to suspect my principles , and therefore will engage my more serious attention , till she shall have little reason to ridicule or laugh at her friend .


But , on the other hand , if this LA MOTTE does not move at the injunction of HORACE , nor at the pretended penitence of the letter-loving HARRIET , and , by these means , HARRIET should be left  to herself , she must absolutely return to the bosom of the poor pedant , and I will assuredly sacrifice the possession of her person to the unblemished security of my character , which , I am aware , must inevitably suffer by being avowedly the Cicisbeo of a wife little distinguished amongst the bathers and water-bibbers of fashion .


If , indeed , she had been blessed with a sallow damsel for a sister , or a prudent gentlewoman for her aunt , it might have been another matter : but I again repeat it to you , that , in a place like this , in this sneaking , inquisitive country of Britain , it is , to all intents and purposes , requisite , for the security of my system , that there should be some third person in a family , by way of screen  and rather than have our mistresses alone , that is , unprotected by some ostensible he , or she ,  that is answerable for them in the parish where they visit , or where they reside , it is better for our plan of action , that we are sheltered under the withered wing of a maiden cousin of a century 's standing , or even of the great-grandmother herself .


And now , THORNTON , for a word or two on thy own affairs .
If thou hast not , by this time , surmounted the ticklings of thy conscience , and taken possession of that tender tenement , which thy friend the Lieutenant left to thee , thou deservest to be for ever discarded .


What !
Hast thou an angel in `` earth 's mould ? ''
Is she in a wilderness of sweets ?
Art thou invited by a bed of roses ?
Art thou neither in fear of being blasted by detection , nor of incurring the prattle of a single gossip of either sex , ( seeing that  thou art in a retirement perfectly shaded by a shrubbery of perfumes , and apart from a second house ) , and Is the good man of the house gone a long journey into a far country ?
- Is all this in the way of propitiating thy advances , masked , as I presume they would be , in the fine veil of modesty , manner , and firmness , each ( like co-partners , whose interest it is to promote common-right in the same business ) assisting the other ?
and Dost thou , after all , boggle at a shadow - a maukin - at conscience ?


Admitting even all thy wishes crowned with success - where 's the mischief ?
Thou dost not despoil her : the Lieutenant is ignorant of what is granted , as of what was never attempted .
The STANHOPE scheme of fruition suffers us not to do any real injury to individuals singly , or to the community  collectively  we are neither to betray the wife , nor to call the husband the cuckold we have had the honour to make him , nor to breathe an accent that may lead to the remotest suspicion .
In some cases , THORNTON , this system is of the utmost service ( under the STANHOPEAN restrictions , I mean ) both to our King , and country .


How many puny striplings are there who can not do the common rights of nuptial justice to the unhappy creatures that either interest , or folly , has chained them to for life ?
In that instance , it is ours to bestow as a favour , what the husbands can not discharge as a duty .


On the other hand , how many miserable pairs are there , sighing for an heir to an unweildy estate , which must , in default of  issue , devolve to the next fool or driveller in descent ?
There again we are patriots of the first order : Do we not provide a successor , and create a being to inherit all the luxuries of life ?


Nay , even supposing the husband enabled to provide for himself : while our system dictates so inviolable a secrecy , while the joys of it are not invaded by distemper ( and they can never be granted without the prior consent of the wife - and such consent implies that such variety is necessary to her happiness ) - no injury can , in effect , be incurred .
His own offspring we can not destroy  and ours will be considered as legitimate , and not be exposed , like the by-blows of the rake , to the scorn , desertion , and ill-fortunes of bastardy .
So that , view the system of CHESTERFIELD on which side soever you  will , it is a system of policy , prudence , pleasure , good-fellowship , and right reason .


Great length of paper , and much time , have I stolen from more agreeable pursuits , to illustrate this to thee : and if it move thee not , thou art altogether impenetrable , and not deserving so sublime a friend as the immaculate

 THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE , c..


Madam ,


I AM sorry to refuse to the worthy Mr. HOMESPUN ( who hath , I perceive , been obliged to return without his wife ) a request , which I very plainly see  was made to me in the tenderness of his heart .


You do me but justice in supposing that I will keep your unhappy secret , as you very properly call it  for it is no small infelicity to make a secret of any sort necessary to the fame of a woman , and the peace of a whole family , whose connections would all be dishonoured by a disclosure of it .


As far , therefore , as my silence can contribute to your domestic tranquility , you may depend upon me  though I can not but think , she who hath confidence enough to abuse her husband , should have policy enough to conceal the particulars of her crime from a confident  since I know not whether the very knowledge of such circumstances is not an insult to her virtue .


 Your poor husband gave us , yesterday , as usual , an admirable discourse , but there was in it some softening sentiments relating to the pure pleasures of married felicity , which I could not but imagine were suggested by his own situation : he loves you , HARRIET , most fondly , and I could not avoid giving to sentiments , which I connected with certain others , the tribute of a tender tear .
- All the parishioners , and especially the talkative part of them , express their astonishment , some by whispers , others by winks , and all by looks , that Mrs. HOMESPUN should continue , where she has neither relations nor acquaintances  and it is easy to see that Mr. HOMESPUN is the only unsuspicious person in the village  while he , wrapt up in the integrity of his soul , and guarded by his good opinion of you , supposes you  will soon regret his absence , and return to him .


After service he drank tea with me , and with tears in his eyes first urged my going to BUXTON , and then , ( finding my refusal established , ) that I should at least try the effect of my entreaties to invite you back : he even went so far as to hint , with all a father 's glow upon his cheek , at the little necessary preparations against the day in which you are expected to present him with a testimony of your tenderness .
There are various maternal cautions , said he , you know , my dear Mrs. LA MOTTE , to be taken in such interesting situations  and , perhaps , the constant bustles of that watering-place , may for awhile , lull to sleep , or rather agitate her into forgetfulness of those cares that generally alarm the provident apprehension  of her , who is , in a very few weeks , to be a mother .


This was too powerful a painting : I rose to conceal my sympathy : he pressed me by the hand , in visible disorder , and , protesting that he left his fate to my management , saluted me , in his honest way , and went to perform the last offices to a poor woman ( ALICE WELDON ) who died last Wednesday in child-bed of the babe , whose father is not yet acknowledged .
I told your husband , HARRIET , I would exert my power , without telling him that I had long lost my influence over you .


As you were not touched by my former letters - particularly one of them - I despair of moving you by the present , having no new arguments to offer : nor should I , indeed , have troubled you at all ,  but that I did it in compliance to your much-injured , and my ever-esteemed friend , Mr. HOMESPUN , whom I admire , chiefly , for the very simplicity , to which you have made objection .
By the ardour with which he speaks of that Mr. SEDLEY , upon all occasions , I perceive that you have not been seduced by a novice , and yet I can not possibly imagine how he has contrived to make the husband his friend , at the very time that he has betrayed the wife into the thorny paths of personal impurity .
Be this as it may , he must be a very artful creature , and , exclusively of my not going into the same lodging with the polluted HARRIET , I would not chuse to lay myself liable , even to the insult of being the ridicule of a man , who , doubtless , asperses , even more than he destroys .


 It may not , however , be amiss to observe , in the conclusion of this letter , that , if your return to this place is not speedy , it will probably be attended with consequences , which no after-penitence can possibly atone for .


I am , Madam , Your humble servant , C. LA MOTTE .


 Dear Madam ,


MR. HOMESPUN is extremely ill , and much distressed by your refusal to return .
I have revolved the affair over in my mind , and I see , that , if you come on the receipt of this letter , very probable excuses may yet be made , and all may be happy again .


You are still dear to me , HARRIET , and I wish for nothing so warmly as to embrace you , to go with you to our accustomed walk in the meadow , opposite  your paradise of a cottage .
I miss you more and more every day - every hour .
Come then , my dear , name the time , and Mr. HOMESPUN and I will both meet you at the half-way hut , where we were so happy in a party last summer  he desires you will take a chaise ( after you have acquainted us ) to that place .


I can no longer be without you  I want you to sit by my side , near your favourite window , round which the jessamine clambers - and it is now in full blow - to work with me , while HORACE reads , as he used to do , some agreeable author .
We have made alterations in my garden : there is a new summer-house , actually surrounded with roses , sweet-briar , and eglantine  and I want you to approve of this .
In short , I wish for you , on all accounts , both moral and entertaining .
Hasten then , dear HARRIET , to your


C. LA MOTTE ,


 Mrs. HOMESPUN ,


YOUR husband is in his bed , brought thither by the evident indifference of a wife , on whom he doats .
What course this illness may take , or where it may end , I know not : the people here , however , do not scruple to attribute it to the absence and strange conduct of Mrs. HOMESPUN .
Since his sickness , which I do assure you is real , I have considered well the part I am to take in this affair  and , in the hope of restoring a worthy member to the community , by  opening his eyes to the demerit of the object for which he sighs , I am not certain whether I shall not be justified in disclosing to him that which will induce him to change his anxiety into contempt .


I beg you will think of this , and ( as I shall wait your answer before I resolve ) allow yourself to prevent what must make your infamy public .
As to your equivocations , they have no weight with me , and are really too transparent to cheat a child .
It is evident you doat on your seducer .


Farewel .
C. LA MOTTE .


 FANNY is not worse , and therefore my spirits ( which always rise and fall with the pains and pleasures of my friends ) are equal to the delightful task of corresponding with my very dear Lady LUCY .


In my last I only slightly , and in general terms , mentioned the patrons of my happiness : let me now become particular .
My father has formed himself by such a standard , that his excellencies have a dignity peculiar to the dignity of his manners .
He hath ever thought proper to include the friendly in the paternal character   and he inculcates , even to the lowest domestics , a certain sense of independency  a principle , he says , necessary to be maintained even in servitude , and from which branches forth a thousand virtues .
In society , says Sir HENRY , subordination is certainly indispensible , according to the present system  but then it should be considered , that the balance of human affairs is oftener , much more level than we imagine .
If we feed the poor , it is their labour that accommodates us : if we pay them for their toil , it is that very toil to which we are indebted for all the softnesses of prosperity : and if we provide them with a defence against the severity of seasons , and a chamber for the convenience of their repose , ( after they have wearied out their vigour in our service , ) it may be remembered , that , in gratitude for our attention , it is to them we are indebted for every thing that distinguishes  riches from poverty : to their hands we owe the delicacies of the garden - the treasures of the field - the decorations of the mansion - the table of plenty - the robe of luxury - and the bed of down .


Acting upon such singularly-noble motives , Sir HENRY , at a proper crisis , makes each of his children , in some sort , independent - that is , my dear , he allots to each of us such a share of fortune in our own hands as is sufficient to the display and shew-off of the natural disposition .
He esteems it necessary to know the operation of the temper , when it has power to play  this - says he - is not to be known by the common mode of contracting , but of extending : it is impossible to discover any natural propensity , until opportunity gives liberty to all the little passions of the stripling , and indulgence gives way to unshackled inclination .


 Educated under such advantages , and the finer polishes of the school given by a father so venerable and superior  the youthful independent will not turn his honours , and the precious deposit entrusted to him , to abuse : and , if he does , even then there are many ways which Sir HENRY has discovered to turn his deviating conduct into the proper channel .
From kindness like this , Lady LUCY , we are enabled to do nameless occasional little services for the unfortunate  and by such means learn early to form ourselves into habits of sympathy and tenderheartedness .
I do not put gold into your purses , children , like some parents , who promise to double the sum if you shew it unbroken , and undiminished at a future period : I do not give it you to hoard up like misers , nor dissipate like little spendthrifts  but I give it you on purpose to change into small silver : it is my desire that you  should taste early the first of pleasures : look about you : it is a world of misery , as well as imposition : mark your objects to the best of your abilities - be deceived as little as possible , and double your treasure by decreasing it : for six-penny worth of silver , gain sixty moments of fair reflection : for the banquet at so cheap a rate provided to another - the bread and water of gratitude - take in exchange the richer feast of a kind heart : and in this case , my dear children , which is the greatest gainer ?
If you must be usurers , put your money out to such interest  be ambitious of laying it wisely out in the purchase of virtue , and I will supply you chearfully with the means .


We were all walking , LUCY , the other morning , by the side of the bath , when a short , bold , sturdy-looking fellow accosted us for charity .
We looked at Sir  HENRY for our cue : Come along , children , said he , that man is both impudent and able .
As we passed by , the fellow drew up his mouth , and shaking a little dirty bag that he took from his pouch , gingled it over his head , and snapt his fingers .
When we were at some distance - Take care , dear children , of such impostors : bestow not the moment you are supplicated : try the temper of the petitioner : he whom indigence , and the strokes of ill-fortune have not at least humiliated , is not yet an object of your generosity .
As we were going to our carriage , a decayed veteran , in tattered regimentals , reduced to the knees by the perils of his profession , was endeavouring to sweep our way with his hat : little CHARLES ran , without the least hesitation , and gave his bounty .
Yes , said Sir HENRY , there , my dear lad , you could not be deceived : by whatever means  brought about , such a poor wretch must be the mark of liberality .


Opposite , LUCY , to the maxims of the present age , thus do our parents encourage us in proportion , as we have conduced to the happiness of others  and for every trifle well-bestowed , we are rewarded with a present four-fold its value , and that , again , enriched by a smile that shews how strongly the goodness of the child vibrates on the sensibility of the relation .


It is another happiness peculiar to the retreat of Sir HENRY DELMORE , that none of its residents are fired by the envy of opposition , or the meanesses of jealousy : so far the reverse of this , that one is studious to compliment the other on some excellence fresh acquired , or more perfected : some display of the heart , newly  discovered , or some additional grace of the person that blooms in the blush , sparkles in the eye , or dimples in the smile .


What , my dear Lucy , can we say to those whose hearts , repugnant to such principles , turn a deaf ear to the music of domestic concord ?
Earthly , groveling creatures , how I pity them !
Warm , however , and alive to this sweetest harmony , is my elegant Lady SAXBY  she feels the soft impression that is made in every finer bosom by the hand of a divinity .
Long , very long , may this charming sensation continue !
As long may we remain , in serious principle , the friends - the admirers - the improvers of one another !


I am my dear LUCY 'S inviolable DELIA DELMORE .


 I SHOULD ill deserve the kindnesses you have been pleased to confer upon me , did I refuse the earliest acknowledgment .
I am truly glad to hear Mrs. MORTIMER is likely to recover , and that you have found such a retreat as is agreeable to your family , contiguous to the bath .


Ah !
Miss DELMORE , what pictures have you drawn - happy friend - enviable DELIA !
and yet still , methinks , is there wanting one article - one principal figure , to compleat your fine and high-coloured  family-piece .
Why , my dear girl , so forgetful of yourself ?
Great , as are your present felicities , I am persuaded they admit addition .
There is a passion , my DELIA , that gives the last fine finish to the bliss of an innocent life : it is the animator of every other happiness  and I am surprised that a heart so gentle as Miss DELMORE 'S should so long remain unpossessed of it .
The pleasures of a pure and mutual passion would not be unworthy her attention .


Amongst the various characters in your train of slaves , DELIA , is there not one that can attract you ?
Hard-hearted girl , how shall we contrive to captivate you ?
Surely you terrify the tribe of humble servants !
A modern lover , who has studied only his rotine of rhapsody , and who depends on the repetition , and arrangement of a certain number of warm words - his  flames and fires , hearts and darts , thrills and hills , groves and loves , Cupids and stupids - has no sort of chance  but when he has rung the changes and chimes till he can do nothing but ring them over again , he is quite at a stand , can go no farther , and is lost in his own absurdity , feels his own insignificance , and makes his ridiculous exit .
Will you , however , never be caught ?


If the rocks of BUXTON are too barren , pray hasten to your Worcestershire paradise : your gardens there - the ancient seat of the DELMORE 'S - contain every thing auspicious to the belle passion .
- You have thickets of roses , which may furnish your sighers with similies , and abundance of bowers , where Cupid may repose on violets : you have beds of primroses to entertain the Silphids , velvet verdure for the  dancing fairies , and lucid water , wherein Venus may bathe herself in brooks - But - I am mistaken , if you now need this poetical Arcadia .
BUXTON rocks have their beauties - pray , my dear , let me hear more of this gentleman of birth , rank , and character - this distinguished he , whose conversation is so pleasing , instructive , and various  who , at first sight , hath all the ease , firmness , and unembarrassed air of an old acquaintance , and who presents himself so engaging to a company ?
Ah !
DELIA - DELIA !
my prophecy will yet come to pass  and , if he proves as valuable as you wish to find him - I know you wish it , and so do n't deny it , DELIA - the most animated prayer of my heart is , that it may be speedily necessary to alter my superscription , whenever I address my fair , and at present , unestablished correspondent .
I am a very happy wife myself , and therefore  have the better right and reason to desire you may be in the same situation .
However , be this as it may , in all states , changes , and transitions ,


I am , truly , Your real friend , LUCY SAXBY .


 Madam ,


YOUR attachment to Mr. SEDLEY is only an aggravation .
Your declaring that you love him , and could sooner die than leave him , is really the cant of a runaway romp of fifteen , who deserves whipping for her naughtiness .
I have done both writing to , and arguing with you , and have only to give you notice , that , as Mr. HOMESPUN is now really incapable of his duty , through actual , undissembled grief , I have come to a resolution ( since neither entreaties , nor any  humanity can weigh with you ) to acquaint him with every circumstance , nay , to make him a present of all your letters to me , if you do not arrive at the Parsonage by Thursday next , which is four days from the date of this .
I have hitherto fondly attempted to soothe your husband 's impatience by making apologies : he desires me to put a letter , written with his own weak hand , into the post : he gave it me sealed , and I inclose it .


I am , Madam , Your most obedient servant , C. LA MOTTE .


 My dear Wife ,


BY some means or other I have caught , as I think it is , a cold , and that has produced a fever  so that I am obliged ( and that must excuse the badness of it ) to write this as I sit up in my bed - that bed , my dear , of which an equal part is your property .
Though I am not , God be thanked , ill enough to alarm you , yet I can not but believe your valuable society  would materially accelerate my return to health , and contribute to my re-establishment .
Mrs. LA MOTTE , who always speaks of you with inconceivable tenderness , has been prevented , as she says , on account of a sore throat , from being with you  and therefore , as your company here would be quite a cordial , and as BUXTON is not , perhaps , the proper place to be in , without a relation , ( even though that tie is almost supplied by the civilities of Mr. SEDLEY , to which worthy gentleman pray tender my hearty respects , ) I could wish you would set off as early after your receipt of this , as can be made convenient .
But I conjure you , nevertheless , not to put yourself into any hurries , and by all means come in a post-chaise , and by easy stages  and charge the driver to go easily , and pray reward him for his care .
Never mind the cost of the journey : consider your present delicate  situation , and all the charming hopes - ( part of which now bring the water into my eyes ) - depending upon it .
Therefore come leisurely , and it is very likely , as I do n't indulge fretting under every slight affliction , you may find me considerably amended on your arrival at our little retreat , which , though I am just at present not able to enjoy it , is , methinks , prettier this summer than I imagined it would be : for all the woodbines I planted have thriven wonderfully  the laylocks , particularly the purple ones , are leafy and blossomed most luxuriantly  and , what I esteem an addition , an innocent little wren has , even in this , the first season of my residence , built her nest in the very center of my arbour between two honeysuckles .
I declare I would protect the poor thing , and preserve to it all the rights of hospitality and good faith , even at the hazard of my life .


 But where am I wandering ?
You will smile , when I tell you , that , though I began in great pain , I now feel little or nothing , except a weariness , from the uncouthness of my posture .
Surely the very reflection upon a beloved object is a charm against misery !
What then , and how powerful , must be the reality ?
I need not pursue the hint : my best HARRIET is not destitute of sensibility .


I am , her very faithful and affectionate husband , HORACE HOMESPUN .


P. S. I have a melancholy postscript for my dear HARRIET .
Poor Doctor DIGGORY has been long confined to his bed , and  employed by the last post an amanuensis to acquaint me that he is incapable of using a pen .
Poor , good man , how I love and pity him !


 OH !
THORNTON , I wished for difficulties , and they are come pouring upon me with a vengeance .
I am absolutely hemmed in by embarassments : at this moment I am between a SCYLLA and a CHARYBDIS , and uncommonly skilful must be my pilotism , or I must split upon the rocks and be wrecked for ever , Never was I , since I set out a knight-errant to fight the world behind my more than seven-folded shield of dissimulation , so truly in danger of being discovered  and thou knowest it is with me , as with what the world calls a much better man ,


 He that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him , And makes Me poor indeed .
But , to come to the point , THORNTON , I am almost at the end of my wits .
HORACE HOMESPUN pines for his absent mate .
Mrs. LA MOTTE refuses to come down  and urges HARRIET to return upon peril of instant discovery .
This very hour did I see such a packet as astonished even me , who am not startled at trifles , LA MOTTE has written with the pen of a SAPPHO dipt in the ink of JUVENAL - Such asperity - such acumen - such a sting in the tail of every sentence !
HORACE , too , hath written - written , THORNTON , though bed-ridden - full of endearment - full of care - full of the husband .
I called in upon HARRIET in the very crisis of my fate  she had the whole packet spread upon the table before her , and had just put the finishing to an epistle that would  have compleatly ruined me for ever , had it been sent .
I caught it from her with the eagerness of a lion , and I inclose it for thy inspection , that thou mayst judge of my situation  which is not at all mended by HARRIET 'S violent declaration of ungovernable passion and wish to live with me for ever .
Oh !
that women could learn , like me , to gratify the passion of the hour , and think no more of it : but there is no seducing a woman into pleasure , but she is so cursedly grateful , as to hug the seducer for ever after , without any regard to time or to place .
I have dined , too , at DELMORE 'S , and thrice caught the eye of FANNY .
By my soul , the old fire is yet alive in her .
I can see it will only be necessary to nurse the embers , and add fresh fuel .
How the duce came she to marry ?
and how is it that , being married , she does not admire her husband , who is one of the finest figures in the creation !
- As  for HARRIET - she must be sent home to the pedant : there is no enduring either her fondness , or the perils arising from it .
That damned LA MOTTE - forgive my ill-breeding , THORNTON  but that confounded woman will be my destruction .
Adieu !
Adieu !
I must cast about for an expedient .
Yours , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 BY all the agonies of an injured and desperate woman , driven to the extreme by the pangs of conscience , and the violences of love , if you dare to betray me , I will make you rue the consequence , though I were to expire in the moment succeeding my revenge .
You know my spirit - then fear it - dread it - tremble before it .
I will not be discovered without making the discoverer pay for her treachery , even with the blood of her heart .
I have not closed my eyes since the beginning of the week  I am in a fever :  I twice fell against the wainscoat this afternoon .
SEDLEY looks colder than he did , but I love him better than either fame , fortune , food , or existence : his manner - his address - his figure - his obligingness , even yet charm me .
I pity HORACE - I love you - indeed I do - I could do any thing for either of you , but leave the sight of Mr. SEDLEY - I own - I own it .
Take care then - do not sport with me  do not abuse the trust I have put in you  for once again I do most solemnly vow a resentment that shall exchange your life for the loss of my fame .


Farewel .
HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 CHESTERFIELD is a cheat  I am now sure of it , Mr. SEDLEY .
His system is not productive of bosom-felicity : it can not procure the best of all applauses , or the approbation that results from a congratulating conscience , however it may deceive the world into encomium .
Alas !
Sir , what are the successes of hypocrisy , or policy , or whatever else you please to call it , when , after all , the incense and enjoyment you receive from the public is paid to our conduct , not as it really is , but as it appears to be  and when even after the luckiest efforts of our delusions - when we have put the happiest of his  precepts in practice - we are condemned to that reflecting hour , which , at some time or another will seize us , and which , in despite of manner and pretence , will have its full measure of recriminating asperity .
In the shame of my heart , SEDLEY , let me own to thee , that I have been labouring to throw even the guarded virtue of Mrs. VERNON , off its bias .
I startled her for the moment , but she recollected herself time enough to prevent her misfortune , and I have had address enough to turn the accident to my advantage : she believes me honest , and she shall find me so .
I have not now time to relate the particulars of this - nor is it , perhaps , necessary - but I seriously wish I could inspire you with any degree of those feelings I at this moment enjoy from having totally discarded STANHOPE , and listened to the voice of VIRTUE .


Farewel .
JAMES THORNTON .


 Sir ,


YOUR eternal reverberation of musty maxims becomes troublesome .
I did not adopt the plan of DORMER STANHOPE , without sufficiently considering every part of it  and if you can find no other subject of discussion than the old , ragged , thread-bare , common-place topics of Vice and Virtue , I must beg that our correspondence may be brought to a period .
As to what has past - if I did not know your sense of friendship , it would be necessary to cut your throat : as it is , I wish you happy in your pursuits .


I am yours , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 I WILL at all events be with you to-morrow : the torment that sat brooding over my pillow last night - the horrors of my dream - the situation and trembling that seizes me as I write this - the poor little wretch that seems troubled within me - all - all conjoin to draw me home - I can stay no longer here - Tell HORACE of my design , and depend on its being put into execution , by


Your HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 Dear and Reverend Sir ,


I HAVE with infinite pleasure obeyed the injunctions suggested by Mrs. LA MOTTE , in hinting to Mrs. HOMESPUN your anxiety for her return .
She heard me with great patience , and very readily consented to go to a husband whom she so tenderly esteems .
I design to see her properly provided with a chaise , and every thing necessary to the delicacy of her situation  and I most heartily pray for your returning health .
I hope you will  forgive my having sent your lady , my fair charge , home , without my attending her  but you will reflect on the world 's aptitude to asperse and censure , and on that account , forgive : for the same reason , I have advised Mrs. HOMESPUN to go in the middle of the day , that even a colour might not be given to the ready tongue of detraction .
Though Mrs. HOMESPUN will be with you a few hours after this , yet I could not forbear anticipating your felicity , though it should even be but for a moment .


I am , Sir , Your most obedient servant , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 Sir ,


THOUGH I am every minute looking out for HARRIET , and have sent my servant to the corner of the town to welcome her , and tell her I am made better by the expectation , yet I can not , in duty , refuse dispatching to you my thanks for your most generous and affectionate arguments and care .
No words are equal to such subjects .
I can only say to you , that you have made a sick man well , and a husband , happy , and that I  pay you the acknowledgment of a tear .
As to your reward - that , Sir , is placed beyond me  it is above , and it must be given to you only by the Father of all recompence .


I am , Sir , With a grateful heart , Your most humble servant , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 CRUEL SEDLEY - how couldst thou treat me so harshly ?
But I will neither quit urging to thee the subject of Virtue , and painting to thee the horrors of Vice  nor will I bring my epistolary correspondence to a period .
What !
have I myself escaped from the snare , and shall I see the foot of a friend ready to be entrapped , yet not endeavour to rescue him ?
Forbid it , fidelity  forbid it , honour !
Yes , SEDLEY , I must continue to love , and will persevere in admonishing thee : for , in earnest repetition , I declare to thee , that I am certain , all the finesse of thy CHESTERFIELD is unable to purchase the  delightful and soothing pleasures resulting from my present and new-adopted system , which I am not ashamed to tell thee ( although it is repugnant to thine ) is borrowed from the Scriptures : it runs thus , SEDLEY - `` Do , as thou wouldst wish others should do unto thee . ''
This is most palpably the sentiment of true policy as well as true honesty  and I am every day more and more persuaded , that nothing but this will , in the end , prevail .
There is a moment , my dear , dissipated SEDLEY , in which , though thou wert to wear the mask of a forty years success , thou must perforce lay it aside , and appear in all the nakedness of Nature .
And can there , I ask thee , can there possibly be a more hideous sight than a hypocrite unveiled , when every deformity can no longer hide itself from observation , when fraud shall be traversed through all its meandering intricacies even to its foul and polluted source ,  and when the very heart shall be displayed , without subterfuge , without concealments , and without a possibility of either being on its own guard , or throwing others off theirs .
By the by , SEDLEY , that sentiment , borrowed ( as I perceive many of thine are ) from the pernicious volumes of thy darling theorist , is subversive of all fair-dealing in business , true affection in the sacred connections with the other sex , and ingenuousness of manners in all human situations .


The Lieutenant is not yet returned , but he hath sent two letters , of which , for certain reasons , I have procured the favour of copies , to inclose you .
If thou hast a single minute to spare from the prosecution of thy ruinous system , read them  and if , after that , thou art not made better - if they want efficiency to check thee in the pursuit of pleasure ,  through the bounds both of law and humanity - farewel to every hope of feeling , farewel to all that ornaments the real gentleman , farewel to manhood .
The first is addressed to me , the second to Mrs. VERNON .
On the receipt of mine , which was the very day of my trial to ruin the fair subject of it , judge what I felt : you know my sensibility , and can imagine thy THORNTON 'S situation when it is poignantly wounded .


 My dear Benefactor ,


GUESS how easily your former favour sat upon my heart , by my readiness to receive from you another !
I had more reasons than you yet know of for inviting you to my villa , and it was those reasons that prevented me from inviting my SOPHIA to partake of the excursion .
To tell you the plain truth , my friend , I have more policy than business in this excursion .
I have lately had offers of preferment - To speak openly , I can have the command of a company , upon joining  General - in AMERICA .
The half-pay of a Lieutenant , you know , Sir , is not sufficient to , even a man of moderation : my wife 's private fortune I have very strictly settled upon herself , as a sort of comfortable security against unfortunate contingencies : I think myself no more entitled to touch the interest of this , than I would infringe upon a property in trust , which , after my decease , was to be the only certain resource of the person under my guardianship .
Another point is , my own thirst of glory .
I was trained very early to the exercise of arms , and although I continued to starve upon my ensigncy for near twenty years - ( I weep with joy , Sir , when I think upon the generous means by which I became a Lieutenant ) - yet the ardours of military ambition are by no means extinguished .
I declare to you , Mr. THORNTON , even blest as I now am  in a competent income , presented to me with the hand of SOPHIA - in the full possession , too , of SOPHIA herself - I can not , even at this time , hear the beat of a drum without feeling my heart bound at the alarm .
In a word , I design to go to the field , and accept the promotion .
I am one of those who side with that party which considers the dignity of Britain insulted by America .
I was bred a soldier , and taught even from my cradle ( for my father had won his laurels ) to feel all the delicacies of martial majesty .
In my opinion , Sir , the Sovereign of these realms is injured : his injuries are mine : it is enough for a soldier to believe his cause is just .
I perceive many of my old comrades have voluntarily drawn the sword , while mine is gathering rust in its sheath .
I drew it , Mr. THORNTON , last night , out of the scabbard , and upon examining the  blade I saw a spot , a lazy spot of inactivity , destroying the noble keenness of its edge .
By my soul I felt myself blush at it , nor can I be ever easy - ever forgive myself - till I have at once wiped away the shame , and the spot , as it becomes my station .
Now , then , Mr. THORNTON , we are come to the point - a point of all others in the world the most delicate .
- SOPHIA , my poor SOPHIA , must , must - Excuse me , dear THORNTON - excuse a blot which my weakness has , I see , made upon the paper - A tender woman will at any time unsoldier the boldest of us .
But , fie upon it !
fie upon it !
't was the infirmity but of a moment : `` I am a man again . ''
In short , Sir , my wife knows nothing of my intention , and I do not know how to break the matter to her .
She has peculiar gentleness of heart , and will , I am convinced , feel the severest  pangs at parting .
This is the first time since our marriage that I have slept from her side , and I wish much to know how the has supported it : if tolerably well , she may , perhaps , be brought to bear the thoughts of a longer absence  and , in that case , I would have you gradually open the design to her , of which , indeed , I distantly hint in my letter to her .
The worst of it is , Mr. THORNTON , women are so apt to associate , with the duty of a soldier , such horrid ideas of death , broken bones , groans , and cannon-balls , that they give a man over the moment he marches from their embraces to front the enemies of their country : however , let us not blame the softness that was designed to soothe us , to polish our ruggedness , and harmonise our natures .
The drift of my letter is evident to you .
SOPHIA must know it : the summer is advancing : many  of our troops are midway betwixt the contending countries : some of them are arrived at the theatre of the war .
I have but a few days to spare .
Dalliances must in no wise be indulged : they are too effeminating : I dare not trust myself with them .
My absence is propitious to the disclosure .
You are not unskilled in argument : you want not the advantages of persuasive eloquence : to you , therefore , I trust the tranquility of a wife 's bosom - Inspire her , if possible , my worthy Mr. THORNTON , with the duty she owes to my character , which longer idleness would utterly obliviate .
Awake in her those sparks which I hope even a female nature sometimes experiences - the sparks of patriotism .
But if you find this impracticable - at least obtain her consent to my departure , and support her sinking spirits with the hopes of my return , and with  the expectation of the honours , rewards , and various distinctions which will thew attend me .
These are the points I leave to my good THORNTON - and I am his


Most faithful servant , CAESAR VERNON .


 Dear SOPHY ,


I FIND business will engage me from pleasure ( that is , from your society ) longer than I at first believed : but you are , I know , too well established in the moral duties , to repine at what is necessary to be done , even though your acquiescence is to be attended with some inconveniences .
Nay , I am not sure , whether , if at any time my country should require me in the way of my profession , you are not heroine enough to lend those arms to  your King , which , were they in such an exigence reluctant , would be wholly unworthy to incircle yours .
- I shall never forget the glorious week we passed together soon after our union , when we made a purchase of Mr. POPE 'S Version of HOMER , and employed our long delightful evenings in reading him through .
Do you recollect with what earnestness we attended every hero in his progress ?
How we joined in the resentment of ACHILLES , detested the injustice of AGAMEMNON , and pleaded the cause of the good old father of the fair CHRISEIS ?
Pray call to mind with how much ardour we followed HECTOR to the field  how we despised the pusillanimous , hare-hearted PARIS  and though we pitied the drooping ANDROMACHE - though we wept over her woes - yet we should have felt for her still more , had she not endeavoured to detain the  warrior from his duty .
Nor can you help recollecting with how much pleasure - a pleasure that was radiant in your dear eyes , SOPHIA - you heard of the various victories atchieved and related by the narrative NESTOR : of his triumphant returns to his native country after the laurels of conquest were waving in his helmet , while the patriotic virgins were scattering in his path the incense of the Spring , and the emulous youths bowed to the victor , and sang the song of success before him .
Before we had reached the Twelfth Book , you was half a hero , and , with the shield and buckler of MINERVA ( her wisdom is already in your possession ) , you would now be fit to take the field , arrange the file , and inspirit at once by your courage and beauty , the soldiers of your own CAESAR .
Do you know , SOPHY , that I am child enough to be vain of the name that  was given me by my godfathers and godmothers .
There is conquest in the sound , and I have a soul that pants , I must confess , to be ranked amongst the ROMAN CAESARS .
But , ah !
SOPHIA , I am only a disbanded , unemployed Lieutenant , and the little glory that I gained in the field in the days of my youth , is now entirely faded  and , without one mark of the sword - without one apologizing scar , by which might be seen the necessity of retreat , I am withering in the eye of my King and country , and shall after a few years fall into an inglorious grave , and be no more remembered .


At a villa in SUSSEX , through which I passed , and where I stopt to dine , I was told of a mansion , which strangers usually went to survey , the property of a veteran officer , whom I fought with , side by side ,  in the first battle that fleshed my arm : I have a thousand times mentioned him to you , under the well-known name of FRASER .
The old man hath left two of his limbs in different parts of the globe : FRANCE hath the honour of his arm , and his right leg adorns the plains of MINDEN : but the trunk is whole , and seems to have acquired fresh vigour from lopping the branches .
Hardihood hath settled the rose of high health in his cheek  the sun hath seasoned his complexion to the heat of the Torrid Zone  and the hair of his head is like the whiteness of a hermit 's beard , that spreads itself beyond the girdle .
He knew me at the first sight , and pressed my hand with an honest roughness that denoted sincerity : - but on seeing me still able , and in the force of youth , at least of middle age , he contracted his brow , and seemed to ask me , by his look , what  I did basking here at home ?
In the enthusiasm of his martial veneration , which rises to every thing but idolatry , he hath at his own expence erected in his garden little monumental ornaments to the memory of his favourite heroes .
BRITANNIA was on one side , weeping over WOLFE  and on the other , the figure of PUBLIC TRANQUILITY offering the olive-branch to CUMBERLAND .
Not a warrior of any celebrity but had at least a bust , a pedestal , or an inscription .
And upon my taking notice of a vacant nich in the center of the garden , the Major struck it with his cane , and exclaimed , In the name of Honour , VERNON , why wilt thou not give an old friend the opportunity to fill this gap of glory with another of the CAESARS ?
I felt at this instant , SOPHY , a flush in my cheeks , and , as we returned together into his house ( which is in the taste of fortifications ) ,  to drink his Majesty 's health , I perceived the tear of repressed ambition descending , and my old friend pronounced it a drop of promise .


I am , my dear SOPHY , Your own CAESAR VERNON .


 I WILL now suppose , SEDLEY , that thou hast read these letters .
Are they not indications of a mind busied in schemes superior to thine ?
While Mr. VERNON is anxious to serve his country , thou art exerting thyself to disgrace it : while he is desirous to obtain the consent of a beloved and beautiful wife , to suffer his absence in consideration of his glory , thou art CHESTERFIELDING it how thou mayst dishonour beauty , without admitting the very ideas of love .
What measures are taken , in consequence of these epistles , thou shalt know in my next .
In the interim , may CAESAR 'S example fire thy imitation  and , if thou wilt copy , mayst thou copy so worthy an original , at least in the nobleness of his sentiments .


Farewel .


 I FIND it impossible to conquer the habits of loving , and communicating to thee my sentiments .
There is a philtre in an old friendship that can not easily be destroyed .
Pardon my rash sayings therefore .
Preach till thou art weary  and only allow me the liberty of reposing with thee all my enterprizes .


What course I am to take in the present crisis , Heaven only can tell .
Such an accident has happened as totally confounds me .
In conformity to my promise ,  I dispatched HARRIET to the languishing pedant  but she had scarce got , as I understand , five miles on her way , when the cursed postilion , willing to shew his dexterity ( according to their villainous custom ) by driving like a devil through the village , at a short turn , or rather angle in the road , overturned the chaise , fell himself from the saddle , and set the horses a-going , while the poor HARRIET was dragged along the earth , with her body half out of the chaise-window , till a countryman caught the off horse by the bridle , and put a stop to the career .
She was carried into a little dirty-looking inn , almost speechless  and , as she informs me , with an arm torn by the glass , which was unfortunately drawn up , scribbled an almost unintelligible line to request I would hasten to see her before she died .
The postboy brought me the note , trembling like a leaf , and white as a shirt , protesting most  fervently that he could not help the accident .
I knew not what to do : I hesitated - dreaded the consequence - wrote a hurried line to poor HORACE , without feeling either the pen or paper - called for a taper without thinking that I wanted wax - sent it to the post by the boy - and then ordered my horses .
The cursed landlord , who is ever alarmed at the sound of a hoof , in the expectation of fresh prey , now detected my disorder , and set every wheel at work to find out the cause : `` He was sorely sorry to see me uneasy  would do any thing in his power  hoped nothing material was the matter - Could he do any thing ?
- he was concerned to see me in such confusion - would do a great deal to serve so worthy a gentleman - mahap I was taken ill - mahap my friends was sick in LONDON - my wife - my aunt - my uncle - Some law-suit , may be , had gone wrong , or sommut or other was most sartinly the  matter . ''
My servant came with my horses to the door , and the persecutor began again : - `` Good lack , good lack , what can be the ` casion of this !
Was I going away ?
- Was I obliged to leave BUXTON ?
- MARTHA , where 's the gentleman 's little account ?
- How sorry he was again !


In short , THORNTON , I was obliged to escape him and my rising rage by rushing into a little slip of ground behind his house , where , under pretence of picking a few pinks that straggled poverty-struck about the beds , I cast about what was to be done .
In this manner I argued with myself : If I go to HARRIET , the affair will certainly be suspected : for how came I so interested in this lady 's misfortune !
If I do not go , it will be barbarous - but then I have sent to her husband , and home is the best and fittest place for a sick woman .
- Upon the whole , I thought it not proper or political  to go  and , as to writing , I dare not give way to my sentiments , for a discovered letter is irrecoverable perdition .
Upon my return into the house , I found the rascally landlord tampering for intelligence with the postboy , who had come upon the saddle-horse , with the tangled traces still about his back - I had well nigh broke out again .
THOMAS , who stays with me , although married , till I can suit myself , looked as if he suspected the matter - the landlord muttered forth a million pities , and talked of our being all mortal , and liable to accidents - the postboy said his horses were out , as I saw , all to pieces , and his chaise shattered in the pannels .


I could STANHOPE it no longer : Curse your horses , chaise , and pannels , all together !
said I - get out of my sight , and leave me to myself : a lady is dying , and you are prating about your damn'd pannels  - TOM , take away the horses - You , postboy , stop till I write a note to the lady , to let her know that I have written to her husband .


I would have gone in to write .


The landlord again struck up : `` Had not the lady better come back to my house , Sir ?
The journey to Mr. HOMESPUN 'S will be too far in her present condition . ''
- Pray , Mr. WYNGOOD , said I , suffer me to do as I please .
The man was piqued at the * slight , and I verily believe will never forgive me .
However , I wrote a note to HARRIET to the following purport , and ordered the postboy to carry it as fast as possible .


 To Mrs. HOMESPUN .


Madam ,


I AM unfeignedly sorry at your misfortune : the moment I became acquainted with it , I sent to Mr. HOMESPUN , who will be with you , no doubt , the moment he is able to ride there .
I hope most sincerely no ill effects will ensue from this distressing accident  and I have some little consolation in understanding , by the messenger , that an apothecary resides in the village where it happened , and that the art of a surgeon is not necessary .
With the warmest wishes for your speedy recovery , I am ,


Madam ,


Your most humble servant , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 I had two reasons , THORNTON , for shewing this , prior to my sending it , to the landlord : in the first place , I wanted to regain his friendship , that is , you know , according to my system , his good word , by an act of confidence  and , in the next , as this was , upon the whole , a mysterious affair , and I could not tell the issue of it , such a letter ( written , as thou perceivest it is , even in the midst of hurry , with a pen of policy ) might do me good , should the matter be hereafter canvassed at the bath  WYNGOOD being , as I before told thee , the greatest gossip of the country .


By this time , I conjecture , my messenger has delivered the note .
Unluckily I have to sup this evening at the DELMORE 'S , Sir HENRY being never happy without me .
Very , very unfit am I at present to figure or sustain myself in company  for , not to disguise matters with you , I am not insensible  to this misfortune of poor HARRIET , nor could I see the injury done to her bewitching form , without a sigh .
But , however , I am equal to all events , and must carry on with vigour what I have begun with spirit : otherwise , I should retreat with disgrace  and for aught I can tell , take refuge from the horrors of despair by the aid of a trigger .
Pray , my dear THORNTON , against these horrible resources .


I am Yours , PHILIP SEDLEY .


 IF thou wert surprized at the contents of my last , prepare , ere thou perusest the present , for fresh wonders .
I was just set down to the card-table at the DELMORE 'S , to pass the interval betwixt the tea and the supper , when THOMAS , upon the full gallop , and with tokens of terror in his countenance , delivered me the inclosed billet , which , had it been delivered in the presence of the company , would have betrayed me for ever to the eyes of this piercing family : but luckily the footman came to say that my servant waited my orders .
Pray read the billet before thou goest any farther .


 The inclosed Billet .
To Mr. SEDLEY .


Most inhuman SEDLEY ,


I HAVE ordered myself , on the receipt of your letter , to be taken out of my bed , and brought hither , in defiance of the Doctor , and at the risque of my life , chiefly indeed because I would see , before the last event , and once more kiss the hand of the still dear , but most barbarous PHILIP SEDLEY .
I write in agony , but am still


Your HARRIET HOMESPUN .


 It was with a difficulty equal to the struggles betwixt life and death , that I supported myself from sinking under this intelligence : I had , however , sufficient presence of mind to return to the company , and make excuses with some degree of coherence  after which I mounted the reeking horse , and , ordering TOM to follow me , went upon the full-stretch to my lodgings .
At my entrance into the parlour I found HARRIET in a strong hysteric : and upon her recovery we had her put into a warm bed .
She is perfectly mangled , THORNTON : her fine face is gashed with wounds  and the landlady tells me that other parts of her person have sustained their share of bruises .
To mend the matter , I have received a long epistle from FANNY MORTIMER , which was delivered with as much peculiarity as thou wilt find in the sentiments .
After dinner the whole family rambled into the  garden , and as I was passing near Mrs. MORTIMER , along the shade of a small shrubbery that affected to serpentine , she , with her own hand , bade me look at that paper : I folded it in my bosom , and bowed  and , just as she desired , no one perceived it .
I have not attempted to answer it , nor can I shew myself decently till I have the reply in my pocket .
This cursed affair of HARRIET unfits me for adventure : however , I send you the letter , and must think what is to be done .
HARRIET is , I find by the landlady , in a doze - I rather think agony closes the eye , and that she is unable to speak .
The Doctor is preparing his plaisters , and a Physician who attends the bath is sent for .
What measure can I possibly take with respect to HORACE ?
and I am not without fears for myself .
` Sdeath , THORNTON , is there never a case in point ?
I must consult my AUTHOR , Adieu !


 Sir ,


AN address from me , under my peculiar situation , will no doubt alarm you : but forms and ceremonies must all yield to irresistible exigences .
I find it necessary to the peace of my mind to write to you .
The accident , Sir , that brought us together at SCARBOROUGH , when your visits to me were very frequent , and , as a single woman , I confess not disagreeable , is recollected with some anxiety .
You were then at some pains to convince me I had made an impression on your sensibility ,  and certain sentiments were interchanged , which it would be , at this period , highly improper to repeat .
It may not be amiss , however , to observe that , prior to your quitting SCARBOROUGH , you did not omit exerting your utmost talents ( and they are not inconsiderable , Mr. SEDLEY ) to engage my heart .
How far you succeeded , it is not now material to enquire .
Be that as it may , my health hath been gradually upon the decline from that hour to this .
It is now some months since I gave my hand to Mr. MORTIMER , than whom there never lived a better character , or a tenderer husband .
He was educated under the eye of my father , who seemed so wrapt up in the ideas of making him still nearer to his family , that , as he thought proper to address me , I could not deny to duty , what possibly I should have refused to every thing else .
In a word , Sir , my worthy father 's  heart was in the match , and it is impossible for a child to disappoint the wishes of such a parent .
The softness , delicacy , and gentleness of Mr. MORTIMER 'S behaviour has ever been uniform and exact : and although it has pleased Heaven to continue my indisposition , and indeed rather to increase than abate it , yet he has not suffered my languor to relax his animated assiduities , but has acted , both by day and by night , the double part of nurse and husband .
Peculiarly unlucky do I account the destiny by which you and I , Sir , meet again : not that I have the least traces of affection for your person , being really attached to Mr. MORTIMER by duty , and upon principle .
At the same time , Sir , I can not but own , your presence gives me uneasiness , and uneasiness of any kind I am not now equal to .
You have , I see , recommended yourself to my father more warmly than ever  my sister thinks very  highly of you  Mr. MORTIMER is loud in your praises  and even my mother , who is not easily attracted , speaks of you with ardour .
As my situation is sufficiently sacred to exclude every possible hope , nay , as I dare presume your own connexions have , by this time , led your inclinations into a more proper channel , I will venture to talk to you with the freedom of a friend .
To speak plainly then , Mr. SEDLEY , there is a point in which you may still oblige me - it is this : that you would enter as seldom into this house as is consistent with a resolution , which I earnestly beg you will take , of withdrawing yourself from this family .
- Do it leisurely , but at all events let it be done .
Ah !
Mr. SEDLEY , pity the perturbation of an uneasy mind .
Before you came , I could at least conceal agitation , and submit to the silent depredations of my distemper .
Every tear I then shed - every  sigh that then stole from me - was attributed to the unavoidable risings and sinkings of a consumptive habit .
But within these few days I have had some conflicts , and every one of them adds to my weakness , to hide - a something that preys upon my heart .
To account to you for this is needless .
If you have the least suggestion that it is occasioned by your appearance , let it interest your humanity - your honour - your compassion - in my cause  and do not , Mr. SEDLEY , render more exquisitely wretched the last hours of a fate at the best unenviable , and not sustained without a sorrow that is hastening its object to the tomb .
Go , then , I conjure you .
Leave me to the protection of a generous family - of a dear sister - of a fond husband .
It is not - I feel it is not possible that I should long live amongst them .
Let me not shew Mr. MORTIMER that I gave myself to him as to the friend and  darling youth of my father - Let not - Alas !
Mr. SEDLEY - what have I said !
Pardon me - pity me - oblige me - leave me .
As your stay at the bath can not be of consequence  as the floridness of your complexion - the lustre of your eyes - the ease in your air - all assure me , your pursuit is mere amusement , I intreat you to change your route - fix it at SCARBOROUGH - BATH - MARGATE - any where , so as you will but leave this place .
I look at you with anguish - I know your rap at the door - I distinguish your step - and , though I feel the impropriety - the crime - the shame - of being disturbed , I can not bear it .
- Contrive , therefore , and that instantly , to begin your task .
of dissolving the connexion here .
Permit me to enjoy the little serenity that a wastin [ ... ] sickness admits .
The poor pittance of ease which that allows , do not you destroy .
As I saw the intimacy betwixt you and my  family daily increasing , nay , as you have been almost constantly at this house for the last week , I could contrive no other way of addressing you but by writing an honest explicit letter , which , I have now done , with many interruptions both from pain , fatigue , and the fear of being seen - but chance has favoured me , and I have unbosomed the secret of my soul undiscovered .
Think not , however , that I mean to enter into a correspondence .
Take a week to withdraw with the elegance becoming your character : during which time I will , as hitherto , endeavour to support myself as an acquaintance , although it is sufficiently shocking that I should be reduced , even to a moment 's disguise .
If you are not disengaged from us by that period , I have no other refuge than a constant retreat to my sick chamber , whenever you visit us : and if this should , in the end , occasion suspicion , and the cruel ,  unconquerable prepossession I entertain be ever discovered , you will remember that , to your injustice must be imputed the consequences , even though the best of parents should be made miserable , the worthiest sister partake their anxiety , and the kindest of husbands fall a victim to the apparent ingratitude of


FRANCES MORTIMER .


 GOD of Heaven , SEDLEY !
what a wretch of adamant art thou !
The disaster of the poor HARRIET , and the pleadings of the pathetic FANNY , have almost exhausted the source of my tears .
Consult thy Author , indeed !
Consult thy heart - consult thy conscience - If thou hast the least touch of Nature in thee - of Nature yet undebauched by the treacherous DORMER - consult that - listen to it - admit its oratory , - obey it .
What shalt thou do ?
- Art thou at a loss what to do ?
- Do what is right .
Quit this instant any farther invasions of FANNY 'S quiet - search the wide earth for medicine and medicinal  people for the hapless HARRIET - comfort the sad soul of the agonized HORACE - watch the dawn of his wife 's recovery - throw CHESTERFIELD and all his works into the fire - execrate the name of EUGENIA - and return , return upon the spur of speed , to LONDON and thy THORNTON .
But as I shall probably touch thee more by example than precept , take the continuation of my transactions in the worthy Lieutenant 's family , and consider well a scene which may be held up in blessed contrast to thine .


Scarce had SOPHIA read her husband 's letter , but she wrote an answer , of which I present you a faithful copy .


 To Lieutenant VERNON .


My dear , ambitious CAESAR ,


THOUGH I am no friend to the devastations of war , I am warmly so to the dignity of my husband 's character  nor can I bear to see his laurels withered , by the childish and emasculating fears and delays of a wife .
Yes , my dear CAESAR , you are - I feel that you are - only a disbanded Lieutenant .
I am not insensible to the reproach in that observation .
But why - cruel VERNON - why is our little fortune locked up so , as to deny us the pleasure of making a purchase so infinitely to our credit .
May Heaven long keep you from the perils of battle !
but you are mistaken , if you think there are not some women who can be tender , without being weak .
Our sex is disgraced by the  general affectation of it .
We are flattered into the notion that we are prettiest in our delicate pretences , and most lovely in distress .
But our minds are not all formed or cultured alike  and , for my part , I had not married a soldier , if I had not designed that he should sustain the duties of his station : and you will recollect , that Capt. BLESSINGTON , my father , in point of martial prowess , yields not the palm even to yours .
Mr. THORNTON and I , both wish your business may soon permit your return to the pleasures of SURRY  and we both also concur to venerate the name of FRASER : but , whatever honours may be in store for my CEASAR , may the nich of the Major be many , many years unoccupied , if it is kept sacred to the memory of my ever-dear Lieutenant VERNON .
Thus prays zealously


His affectionate wife , SOPHIA VERNON .


 There , SEDLEY - there 's a woman !
- the intrepidity of a man , blended with all the virtues and elegances of her sex , and yet may I perish if I ever again attempt her destruction !
On the contrary , I derive joy , real joy , from hearing her sing forth the praises of CAESAR : I join in the panegyric .
I improve by her superior capacity , and though all the Graces are in her train , and she seems formed to every purpose of extacy - has black eyes - an inviting shape - an air of breeding , and features perfectly symmetrical - yet I can now be contented to admire her beauty , and hear the sallies of her wit , without a single endeavour to make her pay for pleasing me , at the expence of her chastity .


Adieu .


P. S. Act like a man , and God prosper thee !


 HORROR upon horrors , THORNTON !
HORACE is come !
He arrived at midnight .
My letter found him in bed .
He hurried on his cloaths , took his pad from the stable , and hath travelled thirty miles through the rain to see his HARRIET .
I was up and musing in my chamber as he came - I unbarred the door - he hugg'd me - thanked me , - kissed me - kneeled down to me , and with an air and look of distraction , desired to be directed to his wife .
I shewed him her chamber , and , let the consequence be what it will , I must stand it out .


 As to FANNY MORTIMER , not the whole congregated world should save her from my embraces .
Oh , earth and heaven !
THORNTON , she is the most attracting form that ever died a death of gentleness .
Then she is such a contrast to the full-formed HARRIET - so slim - so soft of spirit - an eye so borne down by modesty to the earth - her eye-lashes so silken , so curved - the bow of the heavens can not match the archings of her brow - her hair is so glossy - so abundant - such a luxury in its various folds - her very languors are delicious - and as she put the letter into my hand , her palm struck mine upon the tremble - the murmur of love was in the sigh that then broke from her bosom , and the teeth through which it passed were purer than snow .


 Away then with melancholy ideas !
I pity HARRIET , but I must - I will possess FANNY MORTIMER , though I were to die in the effort .


Adieu .
PHILIP SEDLEY .


 My dear Madam ,


OUR poor HARRIET is sorely hurt - but she received me kindly : the tear that she let fall upon my hand , I have suffered to dry , without wiping it away .
The physician is to be here tomorrow , and then you shall know more .
HARRIET asked me several times if I was well - I told her , I was  and yet Heaven knows , I am in a fever at this moment , for I have not been able to  close my eyes , and I was wetted through the shirt in my journey .
My wife seems to have chiefly suffered in the face and arms , I therefore hope the less danger .


Adieu .
I am your real friend , HORACE HOMESPUN .


 EVERY moment in the day affords some fresh and beautiful instance of my noble father 's wisdom and affection .
About an hour after tea this evening , while Sir HENRY was enjoying his serene summer-walk , as he calls it , WILLIAM brought a pencil'd card , and delivered it to me .
It was to advise with him ( Sir HENRY ) about some concerns essential to the general welfare .
Even my little brother and sister , Charles and Caroline , ( who are down with us , ) were mentioned in this invitation : the card requested the company of all the family , adding , that , as  the evening was delightful , his mind composed , and nobody but ourselves , at present , in the house , he much desired that we might all have our share in the general serenity .
How prettily , my dear LUCY , how persuasively this exalted parent proposes , as a pleasure , what his authority might command as a duty ?
But it is among the number of his excellent maxims , that none but froward spirits do well with compulsion , and that a frank and ingenuous tenderness hath in it equal weight and satisfaction .


The conversation past in the garden , under the shade of hawthorns , laurels , and filberts : there is a white bench under it  and a sort of natural arching , bower-fashion , made by the mixture of thick leaves and branches interwoven above .
Hither we came in obedience to the summons : a group of relations loving and  beloved .
FANNY , who had been amusing herself with the pen , ( not having had strength for the pleasures of writing for some time , ) came forward , delicate as angel meekness , with her young brother in one hand , and her little sister in the other .
VENUS , with two of her attendant Graces , could not be more lovely , even though the distress of ill-heath threw somewhat of languor into her air  but then it was a languor so soft , and a distress so gentle , that it only served the more to feminize ( if you 'll allow the word ) , and to recommend her to the spectator as a more pathetic , interesting figure .


Sir HENRY was at first sitting somewhat pensively , with an opened letter in his hand - my mother by his side , leaning her arm on one of the corners of the bench , and reposing her cheek within her hand - the true posture of meditation .
 They both rose at our approach .
Mr. MORTIMER and I went up first  then FANNY , and her twin cherubs : we were a little alarmed , but this was soon dissipated by Sir HENRY , who , seating us all on the bench , drew a green garden-chair from an adjoining shade , placing himself opposite to us , and , with a smile of ineffable benignity , in which the parent and the friend shone beautifully blended , he paid each of us a varied compliment , on our obedience to his wishes , and addressed us to this effect :


`` I have requested your company , my dear and worthy children , to engage your filial attention on several of the most important events of human life : I have , indeed , for some time , had a design to summon you together on this subject , but care , company , and amusement , have thrown their attractions or interruptions hitherto  in the way of my wishes .
I have , however , fixt upon this evening of leisure to deliver to you the secrets of my heart , and in mine are included those of the best of wives , and tenderest of mothers . ''


Lady DELMORE drew her spread fingers across her face , and Sir HENRY repeating his panegyric , went on :


`` I am happy , my dear relatives , to tell you in the first place - and let that serve as an encouragement to you - that I can look back upon a life of more than threescore years , with a tranquility of retrospect , at the same time sincere , christian , and philosophic .
The serenity of my soul is in no degree wounded by the criticism with which I review its conduct through the perilous voyage of my life , in which , by the care of Heaven , I have escaped those quicksands that endanger our youth ,  and those rocks which alarm us in age .
But that which I account far the richest indulgence of Providence , is that dear prospect which I now behold in the persons of this beauteous circle - a circle filled with the pledges of this generous creature 's invariable fidelity , and the testimonies of my continent attachment to excellence so distinguished . ''


My mother rose , LUCY , gave her hand to Sir HENRY , looked at him a moment - looked at him blooming even in age - sighed softly , and returned to her seat .


Sir HENRY proceeded :


`` The season of infancy is past with most of you  and its pleasures are succeeded by reflections of a higher nature .
Even this sweet pair - ( here he pointed to my young brother and sister ) - are at the age  of distinguishing , and the rest are mature .
The blossoms of youth promise a generous fruitage .
You , DELIA , have not yet been rewarded by the tenderness of such a man as my MORTIMER : yet the colour of your life will depend on the exchange of your name .
Your mother 's expectations , like mine , are sanguine , and extensive : our eyes are turned on your every action - We hope to see you all the supports of our declining age : our sun is about to set , and we wish its departure may be gilded by your virtues and indulgences .


`` The father of a family is at once a sublime and venerable character .
My full heart dilates as I see myself encompassed by these charming portraits of ourselves . ''


Here Lady DELMORE melted into tears of transport , but endeavoured to conceal them .


 `` I can form to myself ( continued my father ) no ideas beyond it , nor many equal .
Our family is at present the seat of integrity , unanimity , and mutual confidence .
Our pleasures are reflected upon each other , and we reciprocally give and receive inimitable complacence .
Yet we must be alarmed for those we love .
Though the tenour of your conduct , and the gratitude of your tempers , make us less fearful of deviation , and though the maxims we have ever been industrious to inculcate make us more secure and inapprehensive , yet certain tremors will inevitably touch the bosom of a parent : be not displeased , therefore , my children , if I give you a few general precepts , for your establishment and adoption .
They come sanctified to you with the venerable imprimatur of more than fifty years experience .
The maxims which are necessary to regulate an  ingenuous mind are neither multiplied nor intricate .
The very corner-stone of a great character is a clear conscience : if you feel well , you will act well : and if you do not , all the talents in the world will only serve to torment you .
Never wear a mask before your motives , but when it is absolutely necessary to the felicity of life , such as deceiving , or rather bewitching , the unprincipled into virtue : some tempers can not bear the plain Truth  she is too aweful for them : be it then , in such particular cases , your parts , to lead them to her sacred temple by the most pleasing paths - Alleviate the apparent ruggedness , and length of the way , by such meanders as , though they seem to deviate , may assuredly bring you by the fairest prospects to the shrine of the Goddess .
- I have no objection to your adorning yourselves with all the attractions of exterior , such I mean  as are reflected upon the character from dignity of manner , persuasion of voice , splendor of address , and elegance of air : ` Where virtue is , these are most virtuous . '
They will act like magic , and make the innocence both of your sentiment , and example , perfectly irresistible  and I beseech you to exert them in the cause of that truth and sobriety of heart I have recommended .
- Make use of them to conciliate differences , to inspirit society , to embellish conversation , to soften the harshness of dispute , to animate attention  to please , to instruct , to entertain .
To all these purposes they will be excellent , and ornamental .
But beware of what a licentious and artful indulgence of them may possibly lead to - beware of DUPLICITY  of that duplicity , which , so accoutered , - its destructive sword sheathed in politeness - its heart shielded by the impenetrable  mail of gilded hypocrisy , - is equal to the siege of a city , and might do more real mischief than all the efforts of a legion of avowed villanies .
Of all earthly things , therefore , most detest , what is most to be dreaded , the system of a well-bred , high-polished , elegant deceiver : no eye can see him : no understanding detect him : no policy escape him .
He comes in the form of a Seraph , and those who are themselves honest , can not imagine that he is a Syren .


`` At your time of life it is hard , extremely hard , to master the predominant inclination  yet virtuous exercise will habituate the soul to the practice of uniform honour .
To you , DELIA , I am now going to speak more particularly : - There is a passion , which , rightly directed , is the source of every noble and genuine greatness .
FANNY and Mr. MORTIMER , I trust , are not insensible  to it .
May it affect you , DELIA , in the manner it has affected your mother - this excellent woman , whose regard for me was founded on principles that sustain the first of connections in its due elevation , and adorn the heart by the dictate of which , the hand is presented , with all that can give either spirit , elegance , or real transport , to conjugal engagements .


`` Unadulterated as yet by the smallest commerce with dexterous dissimulation , pardon my alarms lest your innocence and simplicity should be the means of your misfortune .
- That DISSIMULATION , which , under the fair disguise of attracting elegance , led forward by the Graces , can not be detected , even at noon-day , is for ever on the watch  and I know nothing so dangerous as yielding too easily to the tenderness of a new-born passion .
Do not , however ,  mistake me : my system is not rigid : it is not inconsistent with the natural feelings of a delicate disposition .
I have given FANNY to one , in whose education and culture , I myself had a share  and that may shew you , DELIA , that I am no foe to the feelings of Love . ''


Here a sigh heaved gently the bosom of FANNY - I dare presume , it was the sigh of love , Lady LUCY .


`` I wish , continued Sir HENRY , to see each of my children , a wife , or a husband , or a parent , and at the head of an infant society .
I wish DELIA to have the man of her heart - Perhaps she has lately seen that man - Perhaps the accomplished Mr. SEDLEY - ''


In this place FANNY began to complain she sat too long - and I was glad of the  interruption , for you ca n't imagine how my cheek began to crimson : certainly you was talking of me , or - or - or - what was it , LUCY ?


Sir HENRY went on :


`` I will not , DELIA , distress you .
I see nothing at present objectible .
I will not enquire into this matter , till you judge it for your happiness to consult me  and till then , particular enquiries would be premature - perhaps improper .
- Only , be circumspect : look well at the ground before you build on it the foundation of your happiness or misery .
To adopt the language of SHAKESPEARE , `` Wear your eye thus , '' neither vacant , nor suspicious .
In any case of emergency , while we live ( though that can not in common course of terrestrial decays be now long ) , honour me , or your mother , with your confidence :  and when we are no more , I beg all of you will trust to the affection of this worthy young man , our dear MORTIMER , who , having seen more of life , and the transactions of men , is the better able to promote happiness , and avert misery .
- With these sentiments I trust you to your understandings , virtues , and tempers : with these precepts ( which I have a particular reason now to urge ) I trust you to discretion , oeconomy , and fair-dealing .
If I have been tedious , consider I am an old man : if I have dealt in repetitions - or if I have digressed - consider I am a father .
Go , then , my children , cherish each other : avoid the path of Deceit - walk steadily in the road of Truth , even though the roses may not always be in bloom : satisfy the feelings of your own conscience  be merciful - be moderate , and be happy . ''


 As he ended , my dear Lady LUCY , he rose , while the big paternal tear was in his eye , embraced us round , and taking my mother by the hand , walked with her , arm in arm , into the house .


Oh !
my friend , had ever children such parents !
My heart is at this time so full of gratitude , wonder , and the daughter , that I can only add the esteemed name of


Your happy , and highly-honoured DELIA DELMORE .


 AS thou hast not taken notice of any parts of my letters relating to the family of Mr. VERNON , I am in hopes thou art not quite unmoved by the generous virtues that are reciprocated between the worthiest pair I ever knew , and who have made me quite in love with matrimony .
Yes , SEDLEY , do not start - I say sober matrimony  and could I get a certain young lady in the mind , who is now a visitant to Mrs. VERNON , and just arrived , I believe I should enter into the holy estate without hesitation , for I begin to believe ,  whatever thy Preceptor may say , that wedded love is , after all , the most elevated of human connections  nay , I have had several reasons , since my residence here , to adopt the language of the poet , and pronounce that state the most delightful wherein


Thought meets thought , ere from the lips it part , And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart .
Never were souls more exactly in unison than those of the VERNONS .
I present - for your emulation - another instance of it .
Upon my unfolding the Lieutenant 's design to his lady , she dispatched a letter into Sussex , which produced the following reply :


 Lieutenant VERNON to his LADY .


Most dear SOPHIA ,


THAT you was superior to the feebleness of the modish female , who affects to lisp , to shudder at the shower , and tremble at the breeze , I knew before : but that your soul was so nicely attuned to the pains and pleasures of mine , I was not so aware of , till the receipt of your last kind favour .


You will spare me to your King , you will lend him my services against the foes of Britain : noble woman , generous wife !
I am again at Major FRASER 'S , in my way home , and upon my arrival at our peaceful  villa , I will pay you my warmest acknowledgments by my embraces .
I put your letter , with a sparkling eye , into the hand of my old friend : he read it , and burst forth into extacies peculiar to the manly violence of his nature . ''
` Sdeath , VERNON , said he , ten such wives as thine would restore the female character from the ignominy of the rest of the sex .
Such were the Spartan , such were the Roman women : I do not wish our wives to fight , Lieutenant : I do not wish them to wield the battle-ax , nor to eject the bomb , but , in the name of honour , let them suffer their husbands to behave like men , and permit those who wear beards to deserve them .
I love softness , VERNON , and consider it as the female characteristic , but still I would have some distinction made betwixt women and children , exclusive of the mere difference of bodily size : and I do declare to thee , Lieutenant , though I  have seen many women that I could have liked , some that I could love , yet I never dared venture upon matrimony , lest my wife should stand betwixt me and my duty as a soldier : but could I , like thee , have met with a SOPHIA , I had long since taken to myself a brave-spirited wench , who should have spread the triumphal roses under my feet , and wove her garland of welcome against my return .
But you are the happy hero : you are more than a general in the affections of SOPHIA .
Go on then , - embark - exert yourself to merit so illustrious a girl : fail not , I charge you , to visit me with SOPHY under your arm , on your coming again to the country you have honoured . ''
I was preparing to give him the farewel embrace , but he held me by the hand , and surveying his figure in a glass that was opposite , shook his head and burst into tears : `` Thou seest , said he , ( still looking  in the mirror , ) I do not counterfeit  my best arm and my most serviceable leg have left me : my soul wishes for the field , but my body - this useless load of an old fellow , of whom the half is timber - would but shame the troops , and disgrace his Majesty . ''
Then turning to the other end of the room , he took from the mantlepiece a sword , cautiously guarded from the rust by a scarlet case , - `` There - ( continued the Major , after he had taken it from the covering ) - there , VERNON , is the blade that attended me in all my fortunes for more than thirty years : examine it - take notice of the marks of prowess : it is no maiden I 'll assure thee :


A better never did a belt sustain Upon a soldier 's thigh .
Take it Lieutenant .
The hand which used to manage it , is gone , and with it the occupation of poor FRASER : 't is a shame that so excellent a friend should be  converted into a piece of lazy houshold furniture .
Take it then , I say  and when thou art in the front of the battle , remember whose token thou hast in hand , and do it justice . ''
There are other traits , my dear SOPHIA , of this brave invalid 's character , which I shall reserve for the opportunity of domestic endearment .
As to your saying that you see less beauty , and smell less fragrance in the flowers of our garden , since my absence  and then artfully urging that , as a reason why you should accompany me to America , makes me pleased with the compliment , though I am not convinced by the argument .
The Colonies , are now in too much confusion , to afford a lady accommodation  and your residence would be with me , always precarious , and , for the most part , unfit for you .
The scene of bloodshed would be  too near your eye  and the attention I should pay to you , would make me less attentive to my own professional advantages .
Satisfy yourself , therefore , with the friendship of the good Mr. THORNTON - with the exactest correspondence , and with the unalterable love of


Your tender CAESAR VERNON .


P. S. I am glad you are at last joined by Miss SIDNEY .
Tell her I salute her .
-


26.1 .
THORNTON in Continuation .


 There , SEDLEY , is , thou seest , fresh reason to animate thy amendments .
But the postman brings me a packet .
I perceive it is superscribed by thy character , and imprest by thy seal .
Haply I shall find , by the contents , that thy reformation is begun .
In this hope I break thy wax , and bid thee farewel .


 THORNTON , give me joy !
My insinuations have extorted from FANNY `` her slow leave , '' and as soon as I can contrive an interview with her , I am to have it .
Hear , by what a display of my art I won her consent to see me alone .
In reply to her epistle - that which I sent thee - I wrote - though I like not trusting myself to the mercy of ink and paper - another , in which I exerted and exhausted all the delicacy of dissembled passion .
I struck the string most likely to work upon a woman in her situation  and , as a proof of my address and eloquence , I tell thee again , that I prevailed - For once she will see me .
Read her card .


 Mrs. MORTIMER to Mr. SEDLEY .


FOR once , as you urge it with such vehemence , and as you promise to quit BUXTON immediately afterwards , I will see you .
When you see an opportunity , either in the garden or elsewhere , you may employ it in communicating what you tell me is of so much consequence to my fame and felicity .


F. M .


Now then , THORNTON , must I call to my aid DORMER 'S `` unobserved observation , '' and banish all but the present object from my thoughts : now must I discover `` the true mark of a superior genius , '' and shew `` a steady undissipated attention '' till I have ultimately succeeded in this great , glorious particular .
- Nothing shall seduce me a single moment from -  ` Sdeath !
THORNTON , the passing-bell tolls - Surely HARRIET is not dead - No matter - I will not - dare not enquire .
I will command myself this once  and when this scheme is compleated I care not how soon I descend to ELYSIUM and to CHESTERFIELD .


PHILIP SEDLEY .


 OH , Mrs. LA MOTTE !
the measure of my miseries is not compleated - I have every thing to apprehend from both the looks and words of the physician .
Just as he last entered , she called out , without looking at him , that he was the cruellest of men , and then , upon drawing the curtains , begged his pardon , and said she was mistaken .
I have not even yet had my cloaths off - I can eat nothing  and when I drink , it is only to allay the thirstings of a slow fever that is still lurking about me .
Mr. SEDLEY came yesterday kindly to enquire , and just as he had  said - Well , my good Mr. HOMESPUN , and how does our poor HARRIET now - she screamed out with inconceivable violence - bade us shut the door , and then remained weeping and fainting alternately for above an hour .
My fate is really a hard one , Mrs. LA MOTTE  but my conscience is void of offence , and the wisdom of the ALMIGHTY shall not , even now , he questioned by


HORACE HOMESPUN .


 I CONFESS it , LUCY - he HAS pleased me  and I am above concealing from my friend , that I admire his manner even more than his person .
His words , his looks , his motions are truly irresistible  and if you knew half the noble things he hath done since he came to the bath , you would the less wonder at my being caught .
I will only mention to you one or two points of his conduct , which will help you , by such specimens , to conjecture the rest .
His servant had played the libertine with an innocent wench , who depended upon the bounty of the bathers  for her attendance at the pump , and well : the fellow seduced her , the poor deluded wretch lost her virtue , and her means of livelihood at the same time .
Common masters would have cuffed the footman , and called the injured girl a simpleton .
Mr. SEDLEY insisted upon the deceiver 's marrying the deceived  the ceremony has actually been celebrated , and it is said - not by him , for he never speaks of himself - that he designs to see them well settled before he leaves BUXTON .


There is , you must know - a lady , who , on her return from the bath to her house , was hurt by the over-turning of a carriage , and the husband , who is a worthy clergyman , would have been quite distracted , had it not been for the cares , tendernesses , and attention of this obliging man , who hath the art of propitiating every-body to him , and making everybody  around him happy , by those nice and minute , yet truly engaging offices , which ( being in general considered as unimportant , though in reality I find they are but too pleasing ) are too often neglected .
He is now very frequently in our family , and I rejoice to see him so much in the confidence and good graces of my father , mother , and brother .
As to poor dear FANNY , she seldom talks when she can avoid it  and one may see Mr. SEDLEY 'S good breeding , and even the feelings of his heart , in the manner with which he adapts himself to the person he addresses : when his sentiments are directed to Sir HENRY , they are acute , correct , classical , penetrating , learned : when to my brother , they are elegant , noble , dignified , and animating : when to my mother , they are grave , condescending , cautious : when to my sister , gentle , in an under-tone of voice , softened as it  were to the situation of a sick person , and that person a woman : his subjects to FANNY are such as might soothe a spirit much nearer its end than I hope that dear creature is .
He colours beautifully the ideas of hope : he talks of returning health : he paints to her imagination , and he gives such touches to the scene of her expected recovery , that our dear invalid smiles when she is too exhausted to speak , and her husband thanks him , with overflowing eyes , for the entertainment and ease he hath produced to Mrs. MORTIMORE .
In short , LUCY , he is a divine fellow , and I know not what will be the consequence of my trip to BUXTON .
Let what will be the event ,


I am always your DELIA DELMORE .


 P. S. I had almost forgot to tell you that I am half teazed to death with the surfeiting fine sayings of a beau , who hath offered me knick-knacks without number , and has made serious and tempting overtures to my father .
So that you see SEDLEY has got a rival .
Oh , heavens !
that Providence should , into the same world , send two creatures so uniformly different .


Adieu .


 THE Gods have been auspicious .
The interview is past , and the stratagem by which it was obtained is worthy of myself .
Thou must understand , that the sister of FANNY - the lady I mean with the pastoral appellation , Miss DELIA DELMORE - is such an object as can not possibly be past over by the eye of a man who is taught to ANNIHILATE THE VERY IDEA OF CRIMINALITY , and is only intent upon the possession of as much beauty ( without the vulgar consideration of `` to whom related , or by whom begot '' ) as he can possibly find , and the more to be found in one family the better , so as that secrecy which saves  all mischief can be procured .
This DELIA , I say , THORNTON , being in the maiden state , and to all intents and purposes in a marriageable situation , must be addressed in the way of wedlock .
To this end I have so managed the point , as to make one sister aid me in a design upon the other , while , in the mean time , I have so contrived it , that both shall be plotting their own personal pleasure : nay , I will make even the husband , father , mother , and the very coxcomb I before told thee of , who is my rival , the ostensible puppets on this occasion , while I , in the supremacy of my wit , and pushed forward by my great Preceptor , will make the whole family subservient to the gratification of thy


PHILIP SEDLEY .


 THY letter , this moment come to hand , convinces me of my mistake in supposing thou wert to be wrought upon by scenes of tenderness and generosity , and proves that it is not in the language and good deeds of either man or woman to turn thy heart .
That Janus of an Earl has , I see , enfolded himself round thee : his maxims have penetrated into thy very marrow .
Nay , thou even goest beyond him : he did but point at the benefits of duplicity in a private letter , at least not by his consent made public , but thou art duplicity itself .
Thou , with an insidiousness  unparalleled , engravest his horrid precepts on thine heart , enterest the temple of domestic joy , and ( under the appearance of an angel , while the cloven foot of the fiend is delicately concealed , ) art in sober truth , could thy real form be seen , the very demon of destruction .
Call not thyself my SEDLEY .
- I own thee not - Thou art the Devil 's SEDLEY , and I begin to shudder that I am connected with such a monster .
Yet I beseech thee - once again in the still , serene , but pathetic voice of friendship - I beseech thee to desist .
Bring not the grey hairs of the venerable DELMORE 'S to the grave .
Pollute not the weak , defenceless FANNY - catch not in thy treacherous toils the heart of DELIA , who deserves a better fate .
Hasten , I conjure thee , to the metropolis .
There thy appetite for women may have its full play .
Our streets are crowded with  chastity destroyed , beauty in ruins , and simplicity seduced .
Dissipate , at least , with less mischief , part of thy large fortune upon these .
From thy present pursuits , I again repeat it , thou canst gain nothing but infamy : and if I could but transfer to thee my feelings , thou wouldst hug them to thy heart for ever , and discard all others with horror .
I have the happiness to please the visitor of Mrs. VERNON , the charming ARAMINTA SIDNEY : she is the friend of FANNY MORTIMER : they correspond : she describes her as thou hast done - Oh !
for GOD 'S sake , SEDLEY - do not harm her - do not push thy cruelties to the dishonour , disgrace - and very probably the death of - a sick woman .
Mr. VERNON is returned : the affection , the happiness of this pair , might soften a panther into tenderness , and subdue the veriest rake into continence .
No wonder it hath  touched the gentle bosom of ARAMINTA .
I find a rapture in her smiles : I anticipate every change of her countenance .
I am so far from desiring to ruin her reputation , that I tremble as I approach her .
I have not assurance enough to kiss her beautiful lips : the slightest touch of her hand disorders me .
I detect myself looking at her , and withdraw my eyes for fear of offending .
I am a very young man , Mr. SEDLEY , and thou and CHESTERFIELD , with your united councils , had nearly led me to every-thing odious : but I saw the precipice time enough to escape it : the society of virtuous people , the friendship of the Lieutenant and his lady - the esteem - and , oh !
that I might be allowed to say - the love , the pure love of ARAMINTA - will , I hope , again restore me to what I formerly was .
As to your secrets , SEDLEY , I shall not betray them :  and you will judge how true I must be to the point of confidence , when I dare not violate it , even though , by so pious a treachery , I could probably save a noble family , and , involved in the fate of that , the friend of ARAMINTA SIDNEY .


I am , With prayers for your change of heart , Yours , JAMES THORNTON .


 PITY , Mrs. LA MOTTE , the distraction of a husband and a father .
I have lost my child , and my wife is in the agonies of death .
The babe that was to have blessed me , and crowned my nine months expectation , has appeared only to weep , and to - die - the mother could nourish it no longer : her agonizing fits have produced an untimely labour , and , lifeless as it is , she will not part with the infant : she hugs it in her arms - cradles it in her bosom - insists upon its being laid upon her pillow , and will not suffer any hand but hers and mine to touch it .
Oh , Mrs.  LA MOTTE !
what shall I do , and whither must I fly .
- There is but one resource , and I will seek it before I finish my letter -


Blessed is the power of prayer !
- I retired , Madam , into my own bed-room , and upon the bended knee of humility sought for comfort to the only hand that , in an exigence like mine , can bestow it .
I rise easier , Mrs. LA MOTTE , indeed I do : He that correcteth hath not utterly forsaken me .
I have softly opened HARRIET 'S apartment , and by the nurse 's waving me to withdraw again , I judge that my poor patient is asleep .
The GOD , who alone can effectually give medicine to a mind diseased , protect and prosper her moment of awaking !


HORACE HOMESPUN .


 MY master-wheels are in motion : I sent brother MORTIMER upon a love-message , made to the lady DELIA 'S eyebrow , saw the old Baronet and his Dame set out for an evening-ride to BUXTON bath , and had the fair FANNY MORTIMER all to myself .
Oh !
ye Deities of Design !
- ye spirits congenial to STANHOPE 'S !
what an hour of whisper and insinuation have I passed !
Oh !
THORNTON , for a second interview !
- It was all done in the very key-note of seduction .


Conscious of the prepossessing idea - I availed myself of her partiality .
I did not  kneel , I did not whine , I did not smack the palms , nor squeeze the handkerchief , but I hit her on the only chord of the soul that could make a vibration in my favour : I pitied her want of health - I praised the sacrifice she had made to paternal quietude .
I was all refinement - all assiduity - all CHESTERFIELD : the features were obedient , and every atom of irresistible art was levelled against her .
I called the colour into her face by one sentiment - I sent it away by another : one look brought the tear - a second dried it up .
Now the rose , now the lilly , prevailed in her cheeks .
Cordials became necessary .
I ORDERED my hand to shake as I presented the hartshorn - the water - the drops .
The lovely object of my battery began to yield - Nature tugged at her heart - her frame became weaker - her passion stronger : every finger tottered : her breath became difficult : she rocked herself in her chair - her eyes were  full - her voice faultered out an - Oh !
Mr. SEDLEY !
- the snare I had laid for her entered into her soul , and she fainted upon my bosom .


The assiduous talents that reduced and sunk her could not even by a different application of them bring her to herself - and when I perceived this , and found it impossible to quiet her increased agitations , I went into the summer-house , where my cause was pleading , and with a decent degree of trepidation told Mr. MORTIMER ( after bowing to DELIA with as decent a confusion ) that his FANNY was rather more indisposed than she found herself before tea .


I am thy - And , in spite of old proverbs , and all cross sayings , will be thy PHILIP SEDLEY .


 YOUR letter found me at tea in this innocent family - I begged leave to break the seal - I read as far as the fainting of FANNY , and the cup fell from my hand .
- Oh !
thou hard of heart !
- Thou insensible - thou incorrigible !
- But she is yet pure .
She fell upon thy bosom - Thy horrid purpose is not yet perpetrated : nor shall it be : for , by the God of Truth , Mr. SEDLEY , if thou dost not write me word that thou wilt give over the destruction of this most pitiable girl , I will , at the risk of all consequences , take the proper steps to put her out of thy power .
 No idle punctilio shall sway me in a case like this .
When Innocence is in danger , to break Faith with a bad man is not Fraud , but Virtue .


JAMES THORNTON .


 TRAITOR and tattler as thou art , I have the start of thee .
- Yes , THORNTON , she did fall upon my bosom  and I reaped the rewards of my insinuations , and of my address , in her arms .
- 'T is true , she returned not the embrace - What of that ?
I was wrought up to the crisis , and her strugglings only answered the ends - and served as the sweet succedaneum of writhing the limbs in the transports of taste .


PHILIP SEDLEY .


 MY unhappy wife is worse than ever  but as her strength decays , her affection seems to increase for me , and this only serves to agonize me the more .
I sat up with her all the last night , part of which she passed without her senses .
In the intervals of her delirium she treated me with a tenderness that penetrated my soul : she called me by every name that could express her fondness - she kissed me - suffered the poor clay-cold corse of our little one to be taken from her .
- It must not be , said she serenely - Let it be given to the grave - bury it decently - be sure  you do not close up the earth - leave a small space for its mother , and all shall be well .
About midnight she mentioned Mrs. LA MOTTE - her dear , kind , noble , virtuous Mrs. LA MOTTE - several times .
About an hour after this she started up wildly , caught hold of the curtains - threw them aside with some violence , and enquired of the nurse for ink and paper - she said , she was resolved to write to him  then , without naming anybody , melted into tears , sunk quietly down upon her pillow , and said - he was not worth it , and it did not signify .
I dare not tell you how my own health is , but while I have any health at all , I am


Your HORACE HOMESPUN .


 VILLAINY too big to express , and which , though I am dying under it , I know not how to punish , without involving innocent people , has been practised upon me .
I foresee - I feel it will be impossible you should ever see again your


FANNY MORTIMER .


 THE last hope is extinguished , and I can only hold the pen to tell you that my wife is - in Heaven , and that the last words which came from her quivering lips , convinced me there is a wretch somewhere upon earth , to whom I am indebted for her death .
I can say no more .


HORACE HOMESPUN .


 WHAT a dreadful change , my dear LUCY , since I last wrote to you !
There is an unusual degree of uneasiness on the countenances of my ever-honoured parents : my brother Mr. MORTIMER is pensive : FANNY was seized with an hysterical disorder while her husband was communicating to me the discourse that passed between him and Mr. SEDLEY , who has never been at our house since .
Mrs. MORTIMER , it seems , knew not that Mr. SEDLEY had interested her husband in the declaration made , by that medium , to me : she remains exceedingly ill : has actually  refused to suffer Mr. MORTIMER to sleep with her : says , she has strong reasons for it , which he shall know at a proper time .
At our coming into the drawing-room , after we were summoned to her assistance by SEDLEY ( who in his confusion and hurry to fetch us , ran down our long garden unbraced and without his hat ) , we found the poor dear creature just recovering from a swoon : her eyes closed - her teeth shut - her clenched hands locked in each other - and her dress in the utmost disorder , I suppose , from the violent changes of posture occasioned by the fits .
I have no heart now , Lady LUCY , to talk of my own affairs  and yet , as you have a right to know every thing that concerns me , I just send you a sketch of my brother 's conversation in the summer-house previous to these alarming circumstances .
My almost constant attendance on my sister will not permit me to transcribe it fair  and  you must be contented with a loose paper on which I have been able to scribble only at intervals .


The Paper , inclosing Mr. MORTIMER 'S Address to his Sister , upon Mr. SEDLEY 'S Subject .


MR. MORTIMER , having led me by the hand through the garden into the summerhouse , began , as usual , with a pretty compliment , told me that he found I had already done execution - that I had made a wound which all the waters of BUXTON were not able to cure , and then proceeded ( you know , LUCY , what an able advocate he is ) to open the design of his calling me aside .
I will own to you , said he , my dear DELIA , that I summon your attention in behalf of Mr. SEDLEY  but I will , as nearly as I am able , recollect his own  words , and , without the least endeavour to sway you , leave the result to your own determination .
I lately had a particular conversation with Mr. SEDLEY , wherein he addressed me , to the best of my remembrance , as follows :


`` The motive of this visit , Mr. MORTIMER , is in confidence , to enquire of you , from whom I have reason to believe she conceals nothing , whether your sister DELIA is under any present engagement of heart , or in the least respect partial to any one in the disposal of her affections  for I should shudder to be the cause of even a negative pain to so amiable a woman : and I forebore to ask this question of Sir HENRY , lest that regard which he is pleased to entertain of me might incline him to something that might be contradictory to the private prospects of his daughter .
I know , Mr. MORTIMER , the fraternal  affection your sister bears you , and I am no stranger , young as I am in your acquaintance , to the all-souled intimacy subsisting between you as happy relations : hence , I imagined it more for the general peace to direct myself to you rather than to any other : for as my enquiries are answered by you , Mr. MORTIMER , I will either bury my ambitious wishes in my own and your bosom , or , should they meet an encouraging reply , I will proceed to take such measures as seem to you most conducive to the happiness I aspire to . ''


Here , DELIA , he paused a little , and then with inimitable grace pursued his overtures :


`` Although , Mr. MORTIMER - said he - I have had of late often the honour of Sir HENRY 'S company , whose nearest secrets of heart I am beginning to sh [ ... ] re ,  I never found that he had any view of uniting Miss DELMORE to any particular family .
But why do I talk thus ?
Sir HENRY spurns the bare idea of compulsitory connections , and his noble nature can never stoop to barter the felicity of a child to interested prospects .
And yet , Sir , may it not be reasonably apprehended , that a soul so delicate - a heart so susceptible - feelings so fine - and a bosom so alive to every nicer alarm , as Miss DELMORE 'S , may have made some wise and favourite choice of her own ?
If so , tell me of it frankly , and I promise , dear MORTIMER , - to join you in promoting rather than opposing the happiness she hopes for .
After what I have now said , you will be quite explicit , ingenuous , and unreserved . ''


He waited my reply  his fine eyes shone with expectation : I told him that I  believed my sister DELIA had not yet , amongst the various pretensions made to her hand , seen the object she could approve in the intimate light he alluded to : that I had often heard her express a proper regard to the excellences , manners , and address , of Mr. SEDLEY : that , as a very young friend , introduced into the family by the hand of so revered and sagacious a father , she had an elegant opinion of his merit : and that though I had not observed the least intimation of her entertaining any sensibility of heart as to his person ( here , DELIA , he bowed , and blushed ) , yet that ( be not displeased , DELIA ) I knew her naturally soft , sensible , and a nice distinguisher of superior endowments .
I concluded with saying , that , for the short time I could boast the honour of his acquaintance , I knew none more likely to inspire Miss DELMORE  and that , as a proof of my good wishes , I  would take the opportunity given me of Sir HENRY and Lady DELMORE 'S evening-ride , from which I would excuse us young folks , to inform you of the conversation previous to any farther procedure .


His cheeks coloured to their full bloom ( and you know what a complexion he has , DELIA ) at this proposal : he begged , with great delicacy , that , till I was pre-acquainted with your proposals , wishes , and views , I would preserve the whole matter a secret , not only from your mother and Sir HENRY , but even from my wife , the angelic Mrs. MORTIMER , as he was pleased to call her : adding , that he could not bear to occasion , by an ill-timed petition , one moment 's uneasiness in a family so harmonized , innocent , and affectionate , as Sir HENRY DELMORE 'S  and that , rather than be cruelly instrumental in the subversion of this , although his heart was in the  cause , he would stifle the pleadings of it to eternity .
- I easily prevailed , DELIA , on Sir HENRY and your mother to excuse us , and , as soon as their chariot rolled from the door , I took Mr. SEDLEY by the arm , and told him I was going to be his advocate .
He pressed my hand , and in a whisper said he would have the honour to keep Mrs. MORTIMER company in the saloon , while I pleaded for him in the summerhouse .


And now , my dear DELIA , continued my brother , may I not congratulate you on the conquest of a man who , if there is any faith in the fairest appearances , is equally adorned in mind and body , and who will , I dare say , instantly proceed to acquaint us with his circumstances and fortunes , if he receives your sanction to be more explicit .
I must own I was never so truly attracted by any man , and he really seems  born for an alliance with a woman as enchanting as himself .
Tell me truly - tell me like a sister - Did you ever see so manly yet so decorated an address - such splendid sentiments - so elevated an air ?
or Did you ever before meet with any gentleman so easy , or so engaging , in that sort of behaviour which is the result of a brilliant capacity , ornamented breeding , and unaffected complaisance ?


When you have read the inclosed , LUCY , give me the sentiment of your heart upon it : for my own part , flattering as it is , I am too disordered , and too much interested in the sudden gloom that hangs over our house , to find satisfaction in any thing .
Yet I am always


Your DELIA DELMORE .


 I AM obliged , my good friend , to summon , not philosophy only , but all the force of christianity to my aid  and even that sustains itself with difficulty against the agitated powers of Nature .
My child is scarce cold in the earth : my wise is tomorrow to be enclosed within her coffin : my duty at my parish is precariously performed , and my strength absolutely fails me .
Yet the last solemn testimonies of a husband 's affection shall not be neglected , Mrs. LA MOTTE .
I have caused the dear dimensions of her dead body to be taken , my friend .
Her shroud is upon the table  before me  and I have sent to bespeak the hearse that shall convey her from hence to my own church , where I am resolved her dear remains shall be deposited .
I will not leave her in a strange land : I will not suffer her to lie where I can not often visit her grave , often reflect upon her virtues , and always protect the consecrated spot which she occupies , from all insult and sacrilegious indecency .
Nay , my friend , I will do more than this : the child that I trusted but on Tuesday last to the tomb , shall be raised again from the earth .
Little did I think the commands of my wife would be so soon necessary to be obeyed : but her dying words shall not be forgotten .
The mother and the son - for ah !
Mrs. LA MOTTE , my infant was a boy - shall be buried in the embraces of each other .
Nay , I will , ( however the custom of the world may pronounce against it , ) - I will read over them the awful service with my  own mouth : the funeral-oration shall be composed by myself : in my own churchyard shall they be deposited , and I will have the fortitude to see the last spadeful of earth cover their beloved ashes before I retire to the agony of my solitude .
That this is an uncommon proceeding I am not to be told : but it is , nevertheless , consistent with MY notions of piety , tenderness , and duty , and shall be done .


I am obliged to lay down the pen , but will not fold up my letter  for though I shall be with you some time to-morrow night - scarcely till the middle of it - I know I shall be incapable of relating to you ( what yet you will be anxious to understand ) the manner of my poor HARRIET 'S death , and therefore I will try to set it down - as I think I can with less misery to myself - upon paper .


40.1 .
In Continuation .


 About an hour before she died , she desired the nurse to withdraw , and , taking me gently by the hand , she looked at me for some time , was almost drowned with her tears , and hid her face within the pillow .
Then , having somewhat relieved herself , she rose again upon her arm , and with a voice scarcely audible , but pierceingly tender , she addressed me thus : ` Oh , my best HORACE !
I have injured thee : I die a victim to the arts of the seducer - a seducer under the fairest form of irresistible virtue .
Inquire not who or where he is - resentment would , perhaps , ruin you both , and GOD can tell , I would not have any mischief befal either .
I have long - '


 Mrs. LA MOTTE , she could not finish her sentence .
A second effort gave her just the power to say - ` Put the child in my bosom , that we may sleep together : ' - after which , her eyes became fixed full upon mine : I fell upon the bed in excessive grief - she struggled hard to give the kiss which exhausted Nature denied her power to impress , and then , Madam , half-turning upon her side , the sigh came forth that wafted her soul to its Creator , and she expired upon my cheek .


Oh , Mrs. LA MOTTE , that I could find the seducer !
Oh , that I could discover the dark complotter of all this mischief !
- Clergyman as I am , I would make him feel the vengeance of a husband 's arm .
- I have enquired in vain - not a clue is left me in her pocket-book - the landlord to whom I applied , without telling him the drift of my application - assures me , that  since my departure from BUXTON , none but his wife and himself were in her company - not even Mr. SEDLEY , who has been constantly , of late , at a family 's out of town - but of him , indeed , I have not the least suspicion - Perhaps the horrid circumstance happened before our coming to the bath - perhaps the infant is the offspring of some other parent - perhaps - Oh , Mrs. LA MOTTE !
Mrs. LA MOTTE !
I am bewildered , and wild with a thousand apprehensions - But why do I rage thus for revenge - Is that consistent with my holy character ?
Is not the poor object of seduction punished sufficiently ?
Are not the child and parent both dead ?
Ah , my unhappy HARRIET !
- I injure thee - I wrong thee !
- I have just kissed the clay-cold lip , Mrs. LA MOTTE - I will thirst no more for the blood of the wretch that has despoiled me - I leave him to the justice of his Maker - Let me go on in  the straight path - let me still walk in the way of my duty .
- The coffin is come - the hearse rolls its sound in the wind - I hear the beat of the melancholy hoof at the door .
- My new-buried babe is bringing into the room .
- It is the deep of night - there is no moon - I will have no torches .


The child is raised - the mother is in her shroud , and placed in her last mansion - the horse waits to carry me home , and I have given directions to have both the bodies carried carefully down stairs .
- God keep your heart from a scene like this , prays the unfortunate


HORACE HOMESPUN .


 Sir ,


I HAVE changed my condition , and by so doing enlarged the circle of my felicity .
The chaste and honourable connection I have now made , with the sacred and rational pursuits attending it , render it very improper for me to hold farther correspondence with a man who professes to seduce the wife , and may , very probably , one time or another , throw from his guard even one who is armed against him by a knowledge of the basest system that ever was adopted .


 I only write this to acquaint you that it is the last letter you will ever receive from ,


Sir ,


Your most humble servant , JAMES THORNTON .


P. S. Mrs. THORNTON - late Miss SIDNEY - has received such a card from FANNY MORTIMER , as pronounces you the most abandoned hypocrite upon earth .
You guess the contents of it .


 HOW shall I be able to write a proper answer to so interesting a letter as your last , in which two subjects so immediately opposite are touched upon ?
As to poor Mrs. MORTIMER 'S health , I anxiously hope she is , by this time , again restored to a more tolerable degree of it  and yet how much are you all to be pitied in being necessarily made the spectators of a disposition so full of fears , hopes , wishes , and apprehensions !
But , as JOSEPH says , `` I dreamed a dream last night , '' and I shall relate it to my DELIA - my fair oracle , for interpretation .
Methought  I was on a sudden - these things are all done suddenly - transported from the city of LONDON to the realms of HEAVEN , where a SERAPH , in the form of my departed sister , ( whom you and I used so much to admire , ) immediately acknowledged me , and addressed me thus : ` Upon what account is my dear LUCY come , uncalled , to Elysium ?
or How get she hither without a guide ? ' '
I come , ' said I , ` in behalf of a dying friend , on the preservation of whose life depends the felicity of mine - Lead me , my sister , to the Angel of HEALTH , and I will kneel down and worship him . '


` If that is the purport of your errand to Elysium , I fear you are come here in vain , ' said CLARISSA : ` there can be no partialities , and yon old , grey-headed , frowning personage you see with a scythe in his right hand , would be very angry  if he was but to imagine what you want .
Death is above a bribe , sister , you may depend on it . '


At this instant I beheld a most beautiful cherub , with golden plumage expanded , fluttering over my head , and alight by the side of me - I trembled and bowed - `` Stranger , '' said the celestial figure - ' I know your business !
- put the name of your friend into that little lattice - it leads to the palace of the Angel of PITY - approach reverently ' -


Soon after I had obeyed these commands , a door opened , out of which came the most elegant appearance of the female sex that can possibly be imagined , and with her a second form , whose face was shaded by a snowy veil - `` Mortal , '' said the first splendid figure - ` the prayer of the affectionate shall not be offered in vain -  thy friend shall live , and lo !
here she is in the bloom of beauty , and in the height of health . '
Saying this , the veil was thrown aside , and in the second form I immediately recognized the features of FANNY , more animated and animating than ever - I ran to embrace the sister of my friend - but the Angel of PITY interposed , and , after bidding me depart in peace , she waved a golden wand , and then the different emotions occasioned by the vision awaked me .


And yet , DELIA , I am persuaded this dream will be propitious .
How truly happy shall I be , if you send me word that I have made a trip to Elysium to some purpose .
Nor will I , at any rate , suffer you to call me superstitious  for the thing is very probable : surely , in recovering such a woman , where such a family and such a husband are concerned , the Angels of PITY and HEALTH may very  properly be interested .
I will not excuse you , if you do not acquaint me with the success of my dream immediately .


As to the conduct and conversation of Mr. SEDLEY , in the summer-house , I can not but admire his address and ingenuity .
His making a confident of your brother was such a stroke of policy as shews him to be no ordinary lover  and I can see , ( from the delicate turn of his compliments , and his management of those nameless delicacies , which , though called minute , are amongst the points of importance , ) that he is no novice in those matters .
- You ask for my sentiments upon the subject : What can I say ?
- Have you not sent me the most amiable specimen of his attachment ?
- Was not this attachment discovered in a mode peculiar to the elegance of his character ?
- Has he not person - manner - fortune - wit - sense ?
- Do you not know what  a complexion he has , my dear , when he blushes ?
- Has he not , by your own confession , the most decorated address - the most splendid sentiments - the most elevated air ?
and Is it not the opinion of your brother , that he never met with any gentleman ` so easy , or so engaging in that sort of behaviour , which is the result of a brilliant capacity , ornamented breeding , and unaffected complaisance ? '
-


Thus recommended , then , my dear , on all sides , how is it possible that my sentiments should not be greatly in his favour ?
How is it possible that I should not wish to alter the superscription of my letters , and direct them for Mrs. SEDLEY ?


After all , suppose I was to change my note : you ask me for my sentiments : suppose you see them in the following letter :


 To Miss DELMORE .


Dear DELIA ,


I OBEY your desire in regard to the offers of Mr. SEDLEY , and here send you the secret of my heart upon them .


In the first place , I would have you to consider , men are generally false , and can assume any shape that forwards and facilitates their purpose .


In the next place , you are most likely so partial to him , that you call those actions elegant which are only ordinary  and his manners , which are in your eye so enchanting , may only be a pretty method he has got of playing upon the surface of common subjects , just to gain his ends , after which he will , perhaps , become as insipid , or as impertinent as the fop whom  you , in your former letters , have ridiculed .
- Ten to one but this polite lover will be a very rude husband  and when the magic of the marriage-circle is drawn in his favour , alas , poor lady wise , how will thine eyes be open to the delusion !
- Putting all these points together , therefore , my advice is fairly this - forbid him your house - banish him from your company - blot him from your memory , and , to cut the matter short , have nothing more to say to him .
These are the councils of your


LUCY SAXBY .


Should I send this laconic epistle formally signed and sealed , what would be the consequence ?
- Methinks I see the whole scene ?
The angry DELIA has finished the letter , and lays it down - she hems twice or thrice , attempting , but in vain , to swallow the affront - Surely , says she , ( beautifully bridling , ) surely Lady SAXBY  might have softened the matter a little - she is very explicit - but how should she be a judge of a man she never saw ?
- I am not much delighted with her letter , I can tell her that - She believes all men are alike - What !
does she compare the divine SEDLEY , to that atom of a fop , that `` bug with gilded wings ? ''
Upon my word , a smart comparison - very agreeable truly - I 'll drop my correspondence with her censorious Ladyship , however .
-


Ah , DELIA !
DELIA !
have I not shewn off the sex faithfully ?
- Do I not know what agreeable inconsistencies we are in love-affairs ?
How ready we are all to ask the advice of another , when we are predetermined to take our own !
Now , are you not , my dear correspondent , are you not a little hypocrite ?
Have you not resolved to encourage SEDLEY , and would not every dissuasive be ineffectual .
But I rejoice to  think you are under no necessity to answer that question - I do not see any suspicious part in SEDLEY 'S behaviour , and I expect that you will distinguish yourself from the rest of your sex , even by the elegance and ingenuousness with which you meet his advances .
That the event may be happiness to both , is most unfeignedly the wish of your


LUCY SAXBY .


 IS then the veil rent , my good Mr. HOMESPUN ?
- Is the bruised reed shaken to pieces ?
- Language was never made equal to such a heart-rending subject .
Remember , however , even in the midst of affliction remember , the character of a christian pastor .
Make haste , Oh , my unhappy friend !
to your own cottage .
Take no vengeance on an unworthy rake , even should you find him .
The thorn is in his heart - the flaming sword is in his bosom .
My feeble consolations -  my hopes - my attentions and my prayers , will be for ever at your service .
Delay not then , longer than it is necessary , your journey to the parsonage - and your real sympathizing


C. LA MOTTE .


 YES , Mrs. LA MOTTE - I will remember what is due to the character of a Christian clergyman , and I am returning , as I ought , to my solitary cottage : but let me enjoin you - though your own prudence will render that injunction superfluous - not to satisfy curiosity of any kind , whether it comes in the shape of condolence , sympathy , or surprize , as to the true cause of my unfortunate HARRIET 'S departure .
Let her memory escape the censure even of an ill suggestion .
I write this upon the road at our resting-place , while the horses are  baited , and the men refreshed .
Ah , my dear Mrs. LA MOTTE , what a mechanical creature is man !
People who are hired for their attendance at a funeral are so familiarised to the last ceremonies , that they smile in their sables  and , while they are conveying youth and beauty to the tomb , can enjoy the ordinary , everyday events of life with as much glee and inconsideration as if they were carrying the gayest bride and bridegroom to the altar .
The mourners who came with me , are at this instant carousing in the next room - while she who used heretofore to be the companion of my journeys , and made every place a home to me by the enchantments of her presence and society , is waiting their leisure , and lying in a gloomy vehicle , without any refreshment whatever .


Without refreshment !
What have I  said , and how does my present practice contradict my former precepts ?
Do I forget the rewards of an innocent soul - and are all my tears shed over the breathless body  which , being no longer animated by that soul , is nothing ?
Surely I have lost my wonted sense of religion , and Providence -


No - Mrs. LA MOTTE - no - I have not .
To religion , and to Providence , be every event committed - but neither have robbed me of my sensibility , and while that remains I can not `` but remember such things were , and were most precious to me . ''
Even memory assists in drawing a picture to distress me -


She who is there emboxed was one whom I chose from the rest of the world - She was indeed my world - I have seen her walk - Her , now clay-cold hand , has  been a thousand times joined in that which is now employed in describing her fate .


She increased every day in sense , and discretion , and beauty - I think not of her last offences - for how should village simplicity be a match for town maxims ?


- Neither man nor angel can discern HYPOCRISY , the only evil that walks Invisible thro ' earth  And oft , tho ' Wisdom wakes , Suspicion sleeps .
At Wisdom 's gate , while Goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems .
It begins to rain , Mrs. LA MOTTE - The drops patter upon the roof of the hearse - I put my face to the casement , and hear them .
- The poor little infant too - my boy - my darling !
- my heir - my first-born !


Oh , Mrs. LA MOTTE , forgive - forgive  me !
- Though I know the independency of soul and body in such a situation - though reason points out to me their separate state , yet I can not , all at once , disunite them .
Human Nature - powerful - pathetic Nature puts in her plea , and you have too much tenderness not to admit it - Do not , therefore , reproach me for ordering another covering to be thrown over the hearse -


More weakness , Mrs. LA MOTTE - I have walked forth , and am a little relieved - the shower is over .
Do not argue with me , dear friend  while the earth contains the beloved remains of Mrs. HOMESPUN , I must consider her as claiming from me respect and tenderness : the duties even of the husband do not terminate till she is in the grave .


But the sable train have finished their  repast - We are preparing to proceed in our journey .
The postman is blowing his horn close beside me : he says this letter will reach you some hours before the wretched writer of it - He waits while I beg of you to be at the Parsonage against our arrival : your presence will be then necessary to prevent me from running the gauntlet through starers , and condolers .
Such pity is , at such periods , insupportable .
The hearse is moving awfully on .
I must not leave it without one real mourner .


Farewel !
Farewel !
HORACE HOMESPUN .


 I CONGRATULATE you , Sir , on your victory over every feeling that should distinguish the human species from the brutal : or rather I salute you upon your notable transmigration !
The system of the philosopher who contended for such a change , you have adopted , even in this world , with success .
Yes , Mr. SEDLEY , you are most compleatly brutalized indeed .
Although I have not the dishonour to know you personally , I make bold to address a few sentiments to you ,  chiefly to acquaint you with what you might otherwise be for some time ignorant .
Your principal victims were buried last night , and the survivor is in a fair way of soon following them .


I could have wished , however , for the sake of your amusement , as it seems you are gratified upon such occasions , that you had been a spectator of this funeral .
Though I can easily conceive you do not love preaching , yet , in the discourse of last night , there were such remarks as might have highly diverted so elevated a mind as yours ?


But , to drop this ineffectual part of my subject , and proceed to another , more likely to excite your curiosity , Do you know , most assiduous and yet most negligent Sir , that a part of your treasures are now in my possession ?
- To speak  plainer : you must know that , amongst the now useless cloaths and other late necessaries of the entombed HARRIET , was found a BOOK , very thickly marked both by marginal notes , crosses of the nail , points of the pen , and strokes of the pencil  and in the fair leaf next the title there is written what distinguishes it to be Mr. SEDLEY 'S property .


Now , it plainly appears , Sir , from the several parts referred to , that you purposely pillaged the volume for the pernicious , and rejected the instructive .
This would have been very proper , had you contented yourself , like other commentators , with reprobating what is wrong , in order to set it apart from what is right : but how could such ordinary methods be expected from a person so very extraordinary !
You , Sir , have even improved upon your original , and have ingeniously  laboured to annihilate its merit , while you perpetuate its infamy .


As an instance of this , I select the subsequent well-illustrated passages , out of a multitude of others equally amiable .
I shall place both the Commentator and his Author in a seemly , orderly manner , and , as you will easily recollect , act the part of a faithful transcriber .


CHESTERFIELD .
`` Avoid seeing an affront , if possible . ''
SEDLEY .
What though L. has sorely stung me - I must please her - and be revenged at a proper time - At present , my cue is blindness .
CHESTERFIELD .
`` If a man of sense perseveres , he will prevail at last . ''
 SEDLEY .
Oh , DORMER , DORMER !
thou dear encourager - How dost thou give me spirits to go on ?
H. H. is an angel of the first order .
CHESTERFIELD .
`` Read faces . ''
SEDLEY .
What a Right Reverend face , and how delightfully legible is that of Master Minister H. - Not a trait of suspicion about it .
I like his honest broad brow - his grey eye - which looks at every thing , and into nothing .
The very man .
Oh divine H. H. !
CHESTERFIELD .
`` Do n't yield to fits of rage . ''
SEDLEY .
I am cursedly addicted to passion -  Will curb myself - Coolness carries all before it - Saucy L. thou shalt suffer - for I will oblige thee  and instead of contempt , shew thee a kindness - Then - then - Mum !
How could the sagacious Mr. SEDLEY trust his serious views with the very woman he meant to destroy ?
But that is easily accounted for .
In another part of the book we find a clue to this mystery .
CHESTERFIELD .
`` Be , like Caesar 's wife , unsuspected . ''
SEDLEY .
Yes , dear , enchanting HARRIET , if it should ever be my fortune to please thee , how would I consult the security of thy situation - how guard thy fame , even with my life - from the breath of Detraction - Ah , couldst thou but surmount  the vulgar prejudices of the world - couldst thou but read in my countenance the attentive - ardent - eternal friend - the - the - Oh !
HARRIET , HARRIET , I will not swear to the truth of my passion , lest you should suspect me - but if I might be permitted to ask a favour with all imaginable softness - In a word , HARRIET - This is the true Volume of Delight - The world is full of masks , and if you and I put ours delicately on , so as to talk not of our own affairs , never shew Master Minister H. any contempt , flatter his little oratorical and classical vanity , and assume the proper flexibility , what joys may we not taste , what treasures of tenderness may we not allow one another ?
Ah !
dear arbitress - keep this sacred volume from every eye but your own : read - and return it to the fondest and most faithful of men !
-


 Here break we off , Mr. SEDLEY , to make way for a reflection : I have always taken notice that your great schemers counteract their fondest purposes .
In the very depth of their conspiracy they discover a little which serves as a clue to the discovery of a great deal  nor did I ever know any man who had a bad secret to keep , and a difficult hand of cards to play , that did not , by too much caution in some points , and too much carelessness in others , lose the honours of the game :


You , under fair pretence of friendly ends , And well-plac'd words of glossing courtesy , Baited with reasons , not unplausible , Wind into the easy , human heart , And HUG it into snares .
And yet , Sir , to apply one more poetical line to you , what , after all , can be said of you better than this ?
` Oh , what a goodly outside falshood hath ! '
 These expostulations , however , Sir , are foreign from the purpose of my address , which is to intimate to you my design of publishing this odd Volume of the great LORD CHESTERFIELD with the Remarks of the splendid PHILIP SEDLEY , Esq - Such annotations will , no doubt , give fresh vigour to the sale , and add exceedingly to the popularity both of the Original and the Commentary .
It will at least shew , how the Man of Fashion may improve upon celebrated precepts , and ( what is , perhaps , of greater consequence ) how the Woman of Innocence may escape the miseries of the practice .
Above all things be assured , the world shall not long remain unacquainted with the gentleman who has accommodated it with so spirited an illustration of a book so much in vogue  and who knows but this conduct may tempt you to favour  the public with the remainder of the Volumes , equally enriched , and by the same eminent hand .
I am Sir , Your indignant humble servant , C. LA MOTTE .


 YOU frighten me to death , my dear FANNY : what can possibly be the matter ?
- Not two hours before your alarming letter arrived at Lieutenant VERNON 'S I had given away my name , my hand , and my heart , to Mr. THORNTON , of Leicestershire .
It is a match of haste , but I hope not of rashness .
He is , I find , the friend of a gentleman now intimate in your family , and , by the disordered answers I have received from my husband , I am afraid , to the wicked schemes of that friend you - But it can not be : Mr. THORNTON would not avow any close connection with a character so  atrocious - nay , I may be mistaken as to the villainy under which you tell me you are dying - Dying , FANNY MORTIMER !
- Heaven forbid - what a wedding-day have you made of mine !
My husband , too , has been in tears almost ever since the receipt of your letter .
I know not what to write , or what to think : if you ever loved , satisfy the impatience of


Your much disturbed , but sincere , ARAMINTA THORNTON .


 WRITTEN in the agony of her heart , and with a trembling hand , receive the last sentiments that are to be expected from your wretched friend .


Was Mr. THORNTON , then , intimate with the - the - Oh !
Heaven !
- was he intimate with this - this - I shudder at his name - this Mr. SEDLEY ?
Perhaps he was one of his correspondents - If so , he knew his designs  and , if he did know them , how shall his heart be appeased for concealing them from the unhappy woman whom they have thrown into despair .
Yes , ARAMINTA , I am in despair  - I am ashamed , not only of my friends , and my husband , but of my shadow - I dare not look in the glass -


Seek not to know the particulars of what - can not be spoken to .
I am abused - deceived - and hurt beyond the possibility of cure .
- I will die -


Dreadful officiousness !
I had flown up to my chamber , and turned the key , to indulge my anguish , in all that luxury , which , on such occasions , is afforded by solitude , when Mr. MORTIMER tapped at the door , to know how I did ?
- My father , sister , and all the family , followed his example  and last of all came my beloved mother , whose eye I beheld through the key-hole , swimming in tears .
- But I was proof even against this - Steady in my resolutions , I dared not to admit her .


 The cause of my new source of grief seems yet to be undiscovered - What of that ?
- I know it myself - The blessed GOD , `` from whom no secrets are hid , '' knows it .
I was myself the aggressor - This fatal hand brought about the horrid circumstance - I betrayed my weakness to him in a letter - I told him his departure was necessary to my repose - That was enough to make such a man perpetrate my destruction .
-


Partiality - Wretch that I was - What right had I to be partial ?
- Mr. MORTIMER claimed my heart - Mr. MORTIMER is the best of men - Memory be still !
-


Hush !
ARAMINTA , I hear his step on the stairs -


He has thrust a card through the door , and gone down again softly to the  parlour .
ARAMINTA - the pen falls from my hand - When I send this I will send with it the card !
- ARAMINTA - I will not live !
-


Read - read , and tell me if I ought not to wish for annihilation .


The CARD inclosed .


EDWARD MORTIMER 'S tenderest invitations wait on FANNY , for her company ( after she has amused herself with her pen ) in the parlour , as DELIA is going to try a gentle tune on her new Piano Forte , EDWARD will attempt a soft accompanyment upon the flute , our little brother is to join in the strokes of the violin , Sir HENRY and Lady DELMORE are to be our auditors , and they are to have quite a little concert .
But they will  be all out of tune , and it is impossible there should be any harmony , unless FANNY is amongst them , now and then bestowing a note from one of the most melodious pipes in the world - Perhaps Mr. SEDLEY may drop in , and the manly elegance of his voice will be delightful - EDWARD desires his FANNY to observe , that this very full card is subscribed by all the persons in the world whom she best loves , and who best love her , namely , by


Sir HENRY DELMORE , Lady DELMORE , DELIA DELMORE , And Her EDWARD MORTIMER .
I must pause again , ARAMINTA - my strength fails me -


47.1 .
In Continuation .
Ten o'Clock at Night .


 No , my friend - I could not obey the summons - I could not , on the other hand , have courage to send an apology - About ten minutes after the card was delivered , I heard the dear , well-known voice of Lady DELMORE , ` Sweet as the shepherd 's pipe upon the mountains , ' tenderly enquire - `` Is my child preparing to join us ?
- Will she make us happy ?
- Take your own time , my love  only remember , that the pain or pleasure of the night depends upon you - Do n't hurry - do n't discompose your spirits '' -


The excellent , most revered , and most  venerable Lady a second time returned unanswered !


Oh !
ARAMINTA - ARAMINTA - how I wept !
- how my heart yearned to clasp this dear mother to it !
- but I was all the time labouring with a dreadful circumstance , which to disclose , would produce complicated misfortune -


God of compassion , to what an exigence am I reduced !
-


Scarce had Lady DELMORE withdrawn , but Mr. MORTIMER ascended the stairs , and `` Will not my lovely FANNY - will not the wife of my soul condescend to oblige us ? ''
said he , with a softness that was a fresh occasion of distress to me -


I could not , upon this , avoid giving to some incoherent expressions , and  wild ejaculations , part of which were uttered upon my knees .


The trembling MORTIMER turned down stairs , and presently I heard the whole family assembled in the entry leading to the chambers , consulting by whisper .


They conclude ( I overhear ) that my brain is hurt - Ah !
that it were , ARAMINTA - How - how , my friend , is this to be accounted for , but I would not enter the sleeping apartment of EDWARD MORTIMER for all that the sun surveys beneath his radiance !
- My soul is not polluted !
-


`` When will the darling of my wishes suffer me ( said MORTIMER just now ) to lead her from that melancholy chamber to her own apartment ? ''


 `` Never - never - never '' - said I , in the extremity of my grief - `` Never , Mr. MORTIMER '' -


`` FANNY '' - replied the astonished MORTIMER - `` Did you speak , my love ? ''
-


I recollected my imprudence , and catching up a piece of paper wrote on it as follows :


`` LET the dear and honoured friends of FANNY , indulge her idle fancy for this single night , and they shall command her for the remainder of her whole life .
She finds herself unusually well , and inclined to scribble to her long-neglected correspondents  and when she is weary she will lie down on the little tent-bed in the room where she now is -


 `` Her peace of mind depends so much on their yielding to this request ( however romantic it may appear ) , that she flatters herself her dear friends will not refuse it to her . ''


I put this under the bottom of the door , and heard the injured , yet most delicate MORTIMER immediately carry it away .


The maid has brought me a candle , and though I find the whole family ( even to my aged father , he who must needs want the balms of repose ) is to set up , I am no more to be invaded - This tenderness - this constant , uniform compliance distracts me - Poor - poor MORTIMER - this is the first time since our union that - that -


 Excuse me , ARAMINTA , I must leave off , and think a little !


47.2 .
In Continuation .


It is midnight , ARAMINTA .
I have come to a resolution - In the common course of human declinings I can not live long - My constitution is utterly gone - A fair excuse offers ( during my present state of infirmity ) to be indulged with an apartment separate from the excellent EDWARD MORTIMER .
Let me , then , dare to live - Let me live , were it only to prevent a discovery which my death might occasion - Let the secret of the most barbarous SEDLEY die with me , without involving in it either my father or my husband -


 The maid tells me , the whole house is in tears - What my venerable father - my mother - all - all in tears !
-


I was unable longer to support the idea  and I will go down to them , that they may rest - But into the chamber of her husband never shall again go the desolate


FANNY MORTIMER .


I will privately give this letter to the postman with my own hand , if I can steal out when he calls for others - But - it must - alas !
my ARAMINTA - it will be my last .


Farewel !
Farewel !
 Dear TIMOTHY ,


How like a dog look'd Hercules , Thus to a distaff chain'd !
` SDEATH , TIMONTHY , `` I 'm sped , I 'm married . ''
In the very flower of my youth , in the bud of my adventures , I am cut off from all the joys of rambling , by matrimony .
In a word , TIMOTHY , the first fair she that I was well with , as the great Lord CHESTERFIELD calls it , complained in form to my  master , who , in the moment of his rage , drew his sword , cocked his pistol , and giving me the choice of two cursed things - namely , death or a wife - would certainly have sent me to my account , `` with all my imperfections on my head , '' even now broad blown in the middle of May , if I had not fixed upon something : and , although in the confusion of my fears I have chosen the worst of the two destinies , by taking to my bed the low-born wench I have simulated , yet `` no man knows the fate he 's born to , '' and I have been to the church with a water-dipper - yea , TIMOTHY , with a creature , who , for some years , hath got her bread by standing at the side of the bath , and presenting a brimmer of the water to the passenger .
Then she is as insipid as the water itself , and ten times more illiterate than the tumbler that contains it .
I marked her out only as a petty experiment , just to bring  my hand into play , as it were , before I ventured to CHESTERFIELDISE - a word , TIMOTHY , I collected from THORNTON 'S letters , which thou knowest I have an occasional access to - with others .
However , my spouse - or rather my sposo - for I would avoid vulgar expressions , which are `` certain characteristics of bad company , and a bad education '' - my sposo is wholesome , pretty , and not ill-made : but as she has not the smallest degree of ton about her , and doth not pretend the most distant acquaintance with either A , B , C , or any of the twenty-four members in that learned family , I despair of ever making her figure as an editor , or , indeed , of collecting together any of my papers , upon which account I charge thee , TIMOTHY , to preserve , very cautiously , all my letters , notes , minutes , and maxims  and as I shall very soon travel - ( for a wife at home will only give me eclat abroad , and thou  canst not believe I will live long with a water-dipper , though she were the Nereid of the spring ) - thou wilt observe to tie them up , date them on the backs , docket them , and if thou shouldst survive me ( which I supplicate the heavens thou mayst not ) , I beg of thee to put them into the hand of the best bookseller then in vogue , and publish them against my consent  and ( as order and method are the very souls of business ) suppose the title ( which I am to know nothing of ) were to run thus :


The Letters of THOMAS TRAVERSE , abroad , to TIMOTHY TRUEMAN , at home : containing EVERY INSTRUCTION NECESSARY TO FORM A FOOTMAN OF HONOUR , VIRTUE , TASTE , AND FASHION .


 Above all points , TIMOTHY , avoid carelessness : let not a slip of our sacred simulations be seen .
SEDLEY , with all his cleverness and graces , is a most thoughtless fellow - saving his authority .
There is not a syllable in his correspondence to THORNTON but I am acquainted with it .
Many a small essential he hits off to admiration .
As far as the maxims of his Author extends , in regard to being well with women , he is a wonder .
But of this exclusive , between ourselves , he is a bungler .
He never puts his epistles into the office with his own hand  he trusts them to me , under the simple safeguard of a wet wafer : my knowledge of the world points out to me the necessity of learning all I can , especially when I can make observations without being observed .
But , besides this , an epistle so hurried off is but half a letter  for nicely is it noted , that neatness in folding up , sealing , and directing ,  is by no means to be neglected : there is something even in the exterior of a letter that may please or displease , and consequently deserves attention .
Thou must know , TIMOTHY , and I tell it thee in great confidence , that I have bestowed several leisure-hours in preparing for thine eye ( and in due time for the world , that is , against my will ) a Treatise on Toothpicking , wherein I shew the precise method of holding , handling , drawing , and replacing the dentical instruments .
Besides which , I have almost ready , an Essay on Nail-cutting  and I have gone a great way in bringing to perfection an instrument - for which , by the by , I expect both a reward and a patent - that is so contrived , as to curve the nails , prevent their raggedness , hinder the flesh from growing up , and preserve them smooth , even , and transparent .
And that every thing may be compleat , I have sketched out a plan for a satire  against tricks and oddities , of which I send thee , underneath , a couplet or two , by way of specimen of the work .


Some pluck the button from the injur'd cloaths , While others rub the ears , and pick the nose .
Some are so destitute of air and grace , Even while they speak , to turn away the face : Nay , some there are , to delicacy dead , Who always have the fingers in the head  This smells his meat , and makes his neighbour sick , This clown eats slow , and that a world too quick .
Nay some , to such a height is rudeness grown , Will grease their lips in picking of a bone .
I must not , however , forget to apprise thee of the most elaborate of all my works , entituled , The Art of Carving , wherein the adroitness and gentility of doing the honours of the table , without hacking across a bone , without bespattering the  company with the sauce , and without overturning the glasses into our neighbours pockets , will be critically considered .
At the end of my performances I propose to annex certain miscellaneous observations on men and manners , such as knowledge of the world - the taking off the hat - offering the hand - making the bow - hanging the sword - managing the cane - holding the knife and fork - blowing the nose - and all the et-caetera essential to a gentleman .
I shall , by way of supplement , add a few free thoughts on modest assurance , a caveat against bashfulness , hints on exterior seriousness , and cautions on flexibility of countenance  with a key to the heart , or the study of weaknesses , infirmities , foibles , and passions , illustrated : in short , TIMOTHY , my labours all together will form a compleat commentary on CHESTERFIELD , and I would have them lettered  on the back thus : TRAVERSE on STANHOPE .
Perspicuity is a peculiar grace .


Oh !
TIMOTHY , why were talents like mine denied an adequate fortune ?
Here has SEDLEY been , almost a month , catching a couple of beauties - simulating a pair of petticoats  when I , had my purse been like his , could have compassed a dozen .
To say the truth , he has been rather unlucky too , for one of his damsels is dead , and the other is moving off .


You will guess what a regard I pay to moral character , when , notwithstanding my poverty , I scorn to repair my shattered fortunes by impeaching him .
No , TIMOTHY , that would be base - let every gentleman 's affairs be sacred : I must not wound my feelings - I must not be blasted , TIMOTHY - I must not be blasted .


 I lament nothing , my friend , but want of money  and yet I have been lately thinking , manner , may procure even that .
Surely , TIMOTHY , the same sprightly powers that can make a cuckold , can not fail , if dexterously applied , to help a man 's pocket .
There is a very rich , old , rheumatical , heavy-heel'd fellow at the bath , whom I have fixed my eye upon , and am resolved to try the experiment .


Surely the serious exterior may befriend us with men as well as women .
I know his weaknesses - and he says he is sure I was born a gentleman .
Money I must really have .


Now , taking a ride upon the King 's high-way , rather late in the evening , is so cursedly hazardous , and I have such an objection to roguery , that I can not think of it : but I am persuaded I can simulate  or dissimulate - ( for I hardly know the distinction ) - a purse or two , and make the person simulated pleased with himself , and much obliged to me for taking it .
This is , at worst , an ingenious way of running round the halter , without putting the neck into it  and if we view it as it ought to be viewed , it is only a notable way of making a man pay so much gold for so much flattery , self-love , and satisfaction .
For the success of all these arduous and laudable undertakings , pray , TIMOTHY  and believe me


Thy constant friend , THOMAS .


 Mr. THOMAS ,


I HAVE received safe all the letters you directed to me , and I should have honoured them much sooner , had it been in my power  but the truth is , I have too much business to allow much time for pleasure - or , rather , I endeavour to make my pleasure and my business go fair and softly , like worthy fellow-servants in the same family .
Besides this , TOM , you and your master , and I and mine - ( if you will excuse me for following your example of  putting the cart before the horse ) - are so very different , that it is impossible we should agree upon any point we talk of .
I am a plain fellow , with a worsted-laced livery and a wig , and you a gentleman with ruffles at your wrists , tambour waist-coat , and your hair tucked in braids under your hat .
I condescend to take a shilling , or even sixpence , a head , by the way of Good bye to you , honest TIM , from my master 's company , and you are above such a custom , and break your guinea at a tavern or a coffee-house to fling down your half-crown to the waiter with a dignified disdain , like a Prince .


PHILIP SEDLEY , Esq your Lord , makes it his amusement to rattle away from saltwater to fresh-water , from this polite place to that polite place , ( to speak more properly , ) from one Ton to another Ton , till he has shewn himself every-where , without  settling any-where .
My master , on the contrary , Mr. Michael Bankwell , is an elderly , industrious , regular , batchelor of a citizen , up at eight , and in bed by eleven , who keeps me because he says I hit his humour , and he hates new faces .
Moreover , Mr. TOM , there is nothing similar between our families .
I save , you do not save .
I am prudent , you are not .
I love a wife , to whom I have been married fifteen years , and am only sorry that I can not see her more than once in the week - You are tired of yours , to whom you have not been a week married .
I delight in the appellation of plain TIM , or TIMOTHY - You are offended unless , Sir , or Mr , precedes the name which was bestowed upon you by your godfathers and godmothers .


In short , TOM - I beg pardon - in short , Mr. THOMAS , I begin to think ( as we so little resemble one another , either in our  likings or aversions ) that we had better not put ourselves for the future to the expence of postage  which ( as you and your master are addicted to go pretty far into the country , and you are apt to write four letters where a man of less genius and spirit would scarce write one ) is really a serious circumstance .


Not that I should propose such a matter neither , were there no other obstacle in the way : for ( to flourish for a moment in your mode ) I must inform you , that


The friends I have , and their adoption try'd , I 'd grapple to my heart with hooks of steel .
Frankly to speak therefore , Mr. TRAVERSE , ( though you are undoubtedly a youth of parts , and able to do as much harm as any lad I know ) you are not the man to my mind .
In a word , TOM , I never took kindly to you  and since your last letter ,  which lies on the table before me , I like you less than ever .
And so you look like a dog now you have got a wife , do you , TOM ?
and marriage at three-and-twenty you call being cut off .
Take care you are not cut off in your flower another way !
For if the scheme of simulating ( the meaning of which God knows ) the rheumatical gentleman 's money out of his pocket should fail , and you should employ the sprightly powers you talk of in making him part with it whether he will or no , you may stand a chance to be promoted even sooner than you wish .


With respect to the books you figure so much upon , I know nothing about them  and if they relate only to picking of teeth , and turning out of toes , paring of nails , blowing noses , and taking off hats , I must  beg to be excused having any thing to do with it  in the first place because I think I know all these things partly as well as his Lordship , and , perhaps , some of them better .
As to knives and forks , I believe I can handle them as well as any nobleman in the universe - I am no bad carver , unless , I am sharp-set  I am not to be told when it is my duty to have my hat under my arm  and , as to the rest , I never understood , till his Lordship told me , that it was decent to pick the teeth at all in company , if it could be avoided .


I shall make you laugh , no doubt , when I acquaint you that I approve a custom my master has of reading to his family every Sunday evening  and , as to books , I have as many as serve my purpose  namely , a Testament left by my aunt Mary in the year 1701 , a Whole Duty of Man , Farriery made Easy , and The Servants Guide .


 You wish for a full purse , you say , for the sake of doing more injuries to innocent women : there we differ again  though I am , in the main , contented with what I have , I now and then sigh for an increase of fortune to distribute amongst many worthy people whom I know to be under a cloud : and ( if I thought you would not smile too much ) I should venture to tell you , that I have two little orphan cousins in my eye , who shall not want a friend - if they turn out well - though they have lost a father : and I have more pleasure in seating my old frail mother in her armchair by a chearful fire , and giving now and then a necessary to a blind brother that I have , all which I pinch out of my perquisites and wages , than it is possible you should even simulate , as you call it , out of a stranger , or get by the ruin of all the men , women , and children , , in BUXTON .


 And so , pretty , polite , Mr. THOMAS , I leave you to your undertakings , and beg that you will do me the favour to leave me to mine .


Lombard-street , London .


TIMOTHY TRUEMAN .


 OH , THORNTON !
- THORNTON !
- THORNTON !
- I must write , I must fly to thy kind bosom for resource , although it were only to tell thee that thy prophecy is fulfilled !
There walks not the insulted earth , at this present moment , such a rascal - such a wretch - such a fiend as PHILIP SEDLEY .
- Oh , my GOD !
what a stroke of heart have I this instant sustained !
- The dead of the night , thou knowest , is generally my hour for projection  and , as this evening was particularly dark , serene , and favourable to my purpose of reflecting upon the mischiefs of the morrow , I left my chamber about  eleven o'clock , and took the path that would soon have brought me to a little grove , by the side of a still streamlet , where I could have indulged `` meditation even to madness . ''
But , oh , Mr. THORNTON !
what an agonizing interruption met me in the way !
As I reached the door where I lately resided ( for on HORACE 'S return to town I changed my lodgings ) , what , of all things horrible to the heart , dost thou think I saw - Not lightning - not the flames of a burning town , but a single torch , that displayed to me two coffins , containing , the two fair creatures in whose fates I had been instrumental , carried on the shoulders of the attendants to a hearse that was standing ready to receive them : yes , my friend - HARRIET HOMESPUN , and the pledge of chaste embraces , were both passing to their last home : I gave a scream that broke voluntarily from my bosom - I fainted in  the arms of a person that was standing in a pensive posture against the side of the hearse - Oh , Mr. THORNTON , - it was HORACE himself !
- it was the honest man - the kind friend - the unsuspicious priest , that I had injured past redemption - I recovered only to meet an eye that sunk me to the earth again - the dominion of the accursed DORMER was past - Truth took me by the heart-strings , and Conscience cast me upon the knee .
I had no power over my own faculties  and the God of Nature , did as he thought proper .
I took the coffin of the wife in my arms - I bathed it with the scalding tears of unaffected penitence - I told the poor , trembling , astonished priest , whom he might thank for all his miseries - whom he might consider as the murderer of his family .
I usually carry with me , in my night-walks , a sword - I was armed with one at present - I offered it to the hand of HORACE  - I tore open my waistcoat - bared my breast , and begged from him the stroke of mercy - He refused to give me the death I merited .
Cruel man !
he left me to my GOD !
I caught the weapon , shortened it , and pointed it at the detested heart , that directed the detested hand ?
but even here I was disappointed by th [ ... ] barbarity of HORACE , who wrenched it from me ere I had little more than perforated the skin  and , assuring the attendants , that I was at times , as now , disordered in my senses , ordered the hears [ ... ] to pass on .
He mounted his horse - bad [ ... ] the landlord go quietly to bed , - say nothing of what had happened - and , wipin [ ... ] his eyes , rode after the machine , that contained the ruins of his family .


I was left alone - my shame is revealed - every man 's tongue will be against me on the morrow .
- I have followed my  Preceptor into the pit of irremediable perdition .
Repentance is the labour of a life : a minute 's ignominy is to me insupportable .
- I will leave this cursed place directly - I will saddle my horse privately  but never , never shalt thou again be disgraced , my still beloved THORNTON , by the presence of the


Detestible PHILIP SEDLEY .


P. S .
The poor FANNY MORTIMER , too , is dying - I have reduced to ashes that family also .
To possess her undefended form in a swoon !
What violence !
What villainy !
Oh , shame !
shame !
- I will not send this letter at present - I must ask the forgiveness of the expiring FANNY  before I die  or else I should be ashamed even to leave existence - I will see her .
Poor MORTIMER , how have I wronged thee !
- Unhappy DELIA , how have I deceived thee !
Let no man be tempted by the maxims of a casuist , to leave the plain , simple path of singleness  and be it engraven upon every heart , indelibly , that HYPOCRISY , however polished , will lead us to the gates of Hell , and that TRUTH , only TRUTH , can conduct us , through her temple , to Heaven !


 Sir ,


I AM this moment arrived in town from BUXTON , where the body of your wounded friend Mr. SEDLEY will be found either by you , or any of those who think it worth while to own him .
He has , as I suppose you know , been the occasion of the most multiplied mischief that ever was , I believe , committed in the same  space of time , in that or any other town .
His death , however , and his repentance , which appears to be sincere , are all that man can have .


It would by no means interest a stranger , as you are , Sir , to particularize the sorrows your friend has introduced , not only in my family , but others equally happy before his admittance into them .
But I understand from this libertine , who put your late letters into my hand , after I had wounded him , that you have married the most intimate friend of my dishonoured FANNY : to her it will not be uninteresting to observe , that it is impossible she should ever behold again alive that most injured and unfortunate girl , who was upon the point of expiring before I left BUXTON , which I thought it prudent to do , ( notwithstanding my indifference  to all future events , ) till I see what is to be done with the broken-hearted authors of FANNY 'S existence .


The scene of Mr. SEDLEY 'S villainy has , I perceive , been already exhibited to the eye of Mr. THORNTON , who hath , it seems , long been his confident and correspondent  though he must pardon me , if I esteem him less worthy the noble-minded ARAMINTA , who could countenance , by his regard , the actions of a PHILIP SEDLEY .
Happy , however , am I to hear , for his lady 's sake , that the connection is at length dissolved .
The affair betwixt me and the offender , happened in the dead of night : the surgeon , to whom I went myself , in defiance of danger , assures me the wound is vital .
Mr. SEDLEY , who could not speak , gave me , at my departure , your address : I  must be excused from discovering mine to Mr. THORNTON at present  and I only write to acquaint him of his friend 's situation .
My own misery is , indeed , extreme : but I have the honour to be ,


Sir ,


Your most humble servant , EDWARD MORTIMER .


 NEVER was the ruin of a happy family so rapidly compleated , as that of your wretched DELIA DELMORE 'S .
All the fair hopes that I communicated to Lady LUCY , in my late letters , are now totally overthrown  and the fairy prospect I drew before her eye hath terminated in death and horror .
Oh !
LADY SAXBY , I can scarce command my hand , or my tears , to enter into explanations : but your kind condolence is the only consolation now fest me , and I will endeavour to collect myself .


 About twelve o'clock , last night , a horseman stopt at our door , and knocked loudly for admittance .
We were seated quite out of spirits at the table , and had just been talking about withdrawing for the night , while poor Mrs. MORTIMER was lulling her cares to rest upon the sopha , having past the day in a manner too melancholy to describe to you .
WILLIAM had scarce opened the door , when a person dismounted , from a panting , hard-ridden horse , and rushed into the middle of the supper-room without any ceremony .
We soon discovered , through the dreadful metamorphose , the features of Mr. SEDLEY , his waistcoat unbutton'd , his hair without a ribbon - his shirt spotted with blood at the bosom , his face pale and squallid , and his eyes bearing all the marks of terror and desperation .
Without making any apology for his intrusion , he drew a chair from the side of the room , flung himself  into it , stampt his foot twice against the floor , smote his breast with an air of inexpressible vengeance , and , taking a paper from his pocket , held it at arm 's length , and burst into tears .
By this time our attention was diverted from this alarming object to another still more dreadful - poor FANNY MORTIMER was in the strongest convulsions I ever remember to have seen - SEDLEY tossed away the paper , after he had crushed it in his hand , and flew like lightning to Mrs. MORTIMER : my father , mother , and my brother , all assisted : we hurried her up stairs : as I had got to the edge of the door , I saw Mr. MORTIMER , with a trembling hand , pouring out a glass of the brandy , and lean , almost ready to sink , against the wainscot : and just as I left the room he took up the paper that SEDLEY had thrown away .
It is a good way to any bed-chamber , and the stairs is  steep : we were sometime reaching FANNY 'S apartment : she remained insensible .
When we got her into the bed-room , Mr. SEDLEY went down stairs - where he had not been two minutes before the words villain !
impostor !
murderer !
were vehemently reverberated .
Sir HENRY ran to the head of the stairs , and saying that he distinguished the clashing of swords , ran down with the utmost precipitation : my mother followed him , and FANNY started from the bed , and staggering at every step , begg'd  for God 's sake , I would conduct her down .
Terror gave her swiftness - horror lent her temporary strength : she was in the supper-room in a moment , but even that was a moment too late - for Oh !
Lady LUCY , the deed was done .
- Mr. SEDLEY was upon the ground , writheing in blood , and Mr. MORTIMER was sobbing in his chair , with the weapon of destruction  smoaking in his hand .
- FANNY MORTIMER saw - shriek'd - shiver'd , and fell down : even at this moment she lies distracted .
Her senses are quite gone : neither bleeding , chafing - nor any other applications can recover her - she pierces us to the heart with her cries .
She execrates first SEDLEY , then herself - then MORTIMER : SEDLEY is put into one of our beds - my poor father wishes to hush the horrid affair as long as possible - Mr. MORTIMER , without a servant , has taken the road to LONDON , and from thence to FRANCE .
SEDLEY has never been able to articulate a word .
That paper , Lady SAXBY , that fatal paper * , created all the mischief .
I inclose you a copy of it , from whence you may guess the other horrid  deeds committed by this all-accomplished villain .
What is to be done Heaven knows .
We are all inexpressibly miserable .
I can not go on : the cries of FANNY are again begun .
-


DELIA DELMORE .


 Sir ,


YOUR letter came to me too late : the despoiler of my family left this world about an hour before its arrival : his body , however , shall be conveyed according to your directions .
It was his dying request that he should be brought before Mrs. MORTIMER , my wretched daughter : but he expired before the request could possibly be granted .
In his pocket , which he begged with his last words I would search , was found a small manuscript , that he enjoined me to consider  as the instrument of every circumstance that had happened .
On opening this I discovered , written with a pencil , the following maxims , the practice of which might very properly lead to more mischief , if that were possible , than they have occasioned .


MAXIMS .


1 .
Have a serious exterior .
2 .
A modest assurance .
3 .
Study command of temper and countenance .
4 .
Dissemble resentment .
5 .
Judge of other men by your own feelings .
6 .
Be upon your own guard .
7 .
Throw others off theirs .
8 .
Study the passions and foibles of both sexes .
9 .
Flatter the vanity of all .
10 .
A flexibility of manners commendable .
11 .
Soothe all - please all - conquer all .
12 .
Be every thing , to every body .
 These are , I perceive , selected from the pernicious volumes of the late Lord CHESTERFIELD , whose letters falling into the hand of a voluptuous character , might very naturally produce effects the most dreadful .
It is very unhappy that me and mine should have been marked out as the first victims .
But that misfortune , like every other , must be sustained to the best of my ability .
My poor daughter is not dead : her senses are in some measure restored to her  and perhaps the life of her mother , husband , and father , may be made supportable by her preservation .
In the midst of my own misery , Sir , I have a wish for the nuptial joy of you , and the amiable young lady to whom you are now so tenderly united .
I formerly knew the brave Lieutenant VERNON , and I beg the compliments of a forlorn parent may be made welcome to him : recollect me , also , kindly to Mrs. THORNTON , and Mrs. VERNON .
 The corpse of Mr. SEDLEY shall be sent to your address , as soon as the hearse can be provided .
He purposely concealed himself from all his worthy connexions , here  nor did I know , till the receipt of yours , the illustrious ancestors and family of the man to whom I am indebted for this accumulated agony .
Notwithstanding this - my resentment survives not the life of the aggressor , whom I will see justice and decency done to , with a scrupulous exactness .
His loss of honour would ill warrant my loss of humanity .


I am , Sir , Your obedient servant , HENRY DELMORE .


 My dear Lady LUCY ,


PROVIDENCE , and Felicity , seem again disposed to smile upon us .
The trial and honourable acquittal of Mr. MORTIMER is over : and the thousand tender assurances he has given his FANNY ( whom Heaven hath spared to us ) that the violence she sustained , is quite forgotten , have contributed , with the caresses of her affectionate parents , to reconcile her to that  life , which God seems intending to continue .
Though extremely weak , she is in perfect possession of her senses , and mends every day .
There is certainly some turn in her favour , and perhaps she is preserved as an example of Almighty benignity , that will not desert persevering goodness , and patient affliction .
The truth of Mr. SEDLEY 'S death - I mean as to the precise occasion of it - is little known .
The Judge was extremely delicate on the subject : so was every body concerned - Mr. SEDLEY 'S relations have not wept over the ashes of their kinsman , nor does any body seem to regret - though every body professes to be astonished .
For my own part - I heartily detest his memory .
Mr. MORTIMER is so truly tender of FANNY , that her gratitude seems ripening into love : none ever deserved a fonder return than our MORTIMER .


 In a word - I warmly hope , happiness will again subsist amongst us .
On Thursday se ` nnight our whole family sets out for Montpelier : the southern softness , and a short absence from the scenes of irksome reflection , with a change of air and company , may be of service to us all .
That , in the mean time , you may enjoy all the tranquility of a worthy , and ingenuous spirit , is the often-repeated prayer of ,


My dear Lady LUCY ,


Your own , undisguised , DELIA DELMORE .
