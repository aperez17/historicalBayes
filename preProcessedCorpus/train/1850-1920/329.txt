Through the widows and the door , which is open , green trees and a small field of sea .


SCENE I


ARETHUSA IS DISCOVERED , DUSTING


ARETHUSA .
Ten months and a week to-day !
Now for a new mark .
Since the last , the sun has set and risen over the fields and the pleasant trees at home , and on Kit 's lone ship and the empty sea .
Perhaps it blew  perhaps rained  ( AT THE CHART ) perhaps he was far up here to the nor ` ard , where the icebergs sail  perhaps at anchor among these wild islands of the snakes and buccaneers .
O , you big chart , if I could see him sailing on you !
North and South Atlantic  such a weary sight of water and no land  never an island for the poor lad to land upon .
But still , God 's there .
( SHE TAKES DOWN THE TELESCOPE TO DUST IT . )
Father 's spy-glass again  and my poor Kit perhaps with such another , sweeping the great deep !


SCENE II


ARETHUSA  to her , KIT , C. [ He enters on tiptoe , and she does not see or hear him ]


ARETHUSA ( DUSTING TELESCOPE ) .
At sea they have less dust at least : that 's so much comfort .


KIT .
Sweetheart , ahoy !


ARETHUSA .
Kit !


KIT .
Arethusa .


ARETHUSA .
My Kit !
Home again - O my love !
- home again to me !


KIT .
As straight as wind and tide could carry me !


ARETHUSA .
O Kit , my dearest .
O Kit - O !
O !


KIT .
Hey ?
Steady , lass : steady , I say .
For goodness ' sake , ease it off .


ARETHUSA .
I will , Kit - I will .
But you came so sudden .


KIT .
I thought ten months of it about preparation enough .


ARETHUSA .
Ten months and a week : you have n't counted the days as I have .
Another day gone , and one day nearer to Kit : that has been my almanac .
How brown you are !
how handsome !


KIT .
A pity you ca n't see yourself !
Well , no , I 'll never be handsome : brown I may be , never handsome .
But I 'm better than that , if the proverb 's true  for I 'm ten hundred thousand fathoms deep in love .
I bring you a faithful sailor .
What !
you do n't think much of that for a curiosity ?
Well , that 's so : you 're right  the rarity is in the girl that 's worth it ten times over .
Faithful ?
I could n't help it if I tried !
No , sweetheart , and I fear nothing : I do n't know what fear is , but just of losing you .
( STARTING . )
Lord , that 's not the Admiral ?


ARETHUSA .
Aha , Mr. Dreadnought !
you see you fear my father .


KIT .
That I do .
But , thank goodness , it 's nobody .
Kiss me : no , I wo n't kiss you : kiss ME .
I 'll give you a present for that .
See !


ARETHUSA .
A wedding-ring !


KIT .
My mother 's .
Will you take it ?


ARETHUSA .
Yes , will I - and give myself for it .


KIT .
Ah , if we could only count upon your father !
He 's a man every inch of him  but he ca n't endure Kit French .


ARETHUSA .
He has n't learned to know you , Kit , as I have , nor yet do you know him .
He seems hard and violent  at heart he is only a man overwhelmed with sorrow .
Why else , when he looks at me and does not know that I observe him , should his face change , and fill with such tenderness , that I could weep to see him ?
Why , when he walks in his sleep , as he does almost every night , his eyes open and beholding nothing , why should he cry so pitifully on my mother 's name ?
Ah , if you could hear him then , you would say yourself : here is a man that has loved  here is a man that will be kind to lovers .


KIT .
Is that so ?
Ay , it 's a hard thing to lose your wife  ay , that must cut the heart indeed .
But for all that , my lass , your father is keen for the doubloons .


ARETHUSA .
Right , Kit : and small blame to him .
There is only one way to be honest , and the name of that is thrift .


KIT .
Well , and that 's my motto .
I 've left the ship  no more letter of marque for me .
Good-bye to Kit French , privateersman 's mate  and how-d' ye-do to Christopher , the coasting skipper .
I 've seen the very boat for me : I 've enough to buy her , too  and to furnish a good house , and keep a shot in the locker for bad luck .
So far , there 's nothing to gainsay .
So far it 's hopeful enough  but still there 's Admiral Guinea , you know - and the plain truth is that I 'm afraid of him .


ARETHUSA .
Admiral Guinea ?
Now Kit , if you are to be true lover of mine , you shall not use that name .
His name is Captain Gaunt .
As for fearing him , Kit French , you 're not the man for me , if you fear anything but sin .
He 's a stern man because he 's in the right .


KIT .
He is a man of God  I am what he calls a child of perdition .
I was a privateersman - serving my country , I say  but he calls it pirate .
He is thrifty and sober  he has a treasure , they say , and it lies so near his heart that he tumbles up in his sleep to stand watch over it .
What has a harum-scarum dog like me to expect from a man like him ?
He wo n't see I 'm starving for a chance to mend  ` Mend , ' he 'll say  ` I 'll be shot if you mend at the expense of my daughter  ' and the worst of it is , you see , he 'll be right .


ARETHUSA .
Kit , if you dare to say that faint-hearted word again , I 'll take my ring off .
What are we here for but to grow better or grow worse ?
Do you think Arethusa French will be the same as Arethusa Gaunt ?
KIT .
I do n't want her better .


ARETHUSA .
Ah , but she shall be !


KIT .
Hark , here he is !
By George , it 's neck or nothing now .
Stand by to back me up .
SCENE III


TO THESE , GAUNT , C .


KIT ( WITH ARETHUSA 'S HAND ) .
Captain Gaunt , I have come to ask you for your daughter .


GAUNT .
Hum .
( HE SITS IN HIS CHAIR , L. )


KIT .
I love her , and she loves me , sir .
I 've left the privateering .
I 've enough to set me up and buy a tidy sloop - Jack Lee 's  you know the boat , Captain  clinker built , not four years old , eighty tons burthen , steers like a child .
I 've put my mother 's ring on Arethusa 's finger  and if you 'll give us your blessing , I 'll engage to turn over a new leaf , and make her a good husband .


GAUNT .
In whose strength , Christopher French ?


KIT .
In the strength of my good , honest love for her : as you did for her mother , and my father for mine .
And you know , Captain , a man ca n't command the wind  but ( excuse me , sir ) he can always lie the best course possible , and that 's what I 'll do , so God help me .


GAUNT .
Arethusa , you at least are the child of many prayers  your eyes have been unsealed  and to you the world stands naked , a morning watch for duration , a thing spun of cobwebs for solidity .
In the presence of an angry God , I ask you : have you heard this man ?


ARETHUSA .
Father , I know Kit , and I love him .


GAUNT .
I say it solemnly , this is no Christian union .
To you , Christopher French , I will speak nothing of eternal truths : I will speak to you the language of this world .
You have been trained among sinners who gloried in their sin : in your whole life you never saved one farthing  and now , when your pockets are full , you think you can begin , poor dupe , in your own strength .
You are a roysterer , a jovial companion  you mean no harm - you are nobody 's enemy but your own .
No doubt you tell this girl of mine , and no doubt you tell yourself , that you can change .
Christopher , speaking under correction , I defy you !
You ask me for this child of many supplications , for this brand plucked from the burning : I look at you  I read you through and through  and I tell you - no !
( STRIKING TABLE WITH HIS FIST . )


KIT .
Captain Gaunt , if you mean that I am not worthy of her , I 'm the first to say so .
But , if you 'll excuse me , sir , I 'm a young man , and young men are no better'n they ought to be  it 's known  they 're all like that  and what 's their chance ?
To be married to a girl like this !
And would you refuse it to me ?
Why , sir , you yourself , when you came courting , you were young and rough  and yet I 'll make bold to say that Mrs. Gaunt was a happy woman , and the saving of yourself into the bargain .
Well , now , Captain Gaunt , will you deny another man , and that man a sailor , the very salvation that you had yourself ?


GAUNT .
Salvation , Christopher French , is from above .


KIT .
Well , sir , that is so  but there 's means , too  and what means so strong as the wife a man has to strive and toil for , and that bears the punishment whenever he goes wrong ?
Now , sir , I 've spoke with your old shipmates in the Guinea trade .
Hard as nails , they said , and true as the compass : as rough as a slaver , but as just as a judge .
Well , sir , you hear me plead : I ask you for my chance  do n't you deny it to me .


GAUNT .
You speak of me ?
In the true balances we both weigh nothing .
But two things I know : the depth of iniquity , how foul it is  and the agony with which a man repents .
Not until seven devils were cast out of me did I awake  each rent me as it passed .
Ay , that was repentance .
Christopher , Christopher , you have sailed before the wind since first you weighed your anchor , and now you think to sail upon a bowline ?
You do not know your ship , young man : you will go to le ` ward like a sheet of paper  I tell you so that know - I tell you so that have tried , and failed , and wrestled in the sweat of prayer , and at last , at last , have tasted grace .
But , meanwhile , no flesh and blood of mine shall lie at the mercy of such a wretch as I was then , or as you are this day .
I could not own the deed before the face of heaven if I sanctioned this unequal yoke .
Arethusa , pluck off that ring from off your finger .
Christopher French , take it , and go hence .


KIT .
Arethusa , what do you say ?


ARETHUSA .
O Kit , you know my heart .
But he is alone , and I am his only comfort  and I owe all to him  and shall I not obey my father ?
But , Kit , if you will let me , I will keep your ring .
Go , Kit  go , and prove to my father that he was mistaken  go and win me .
And O , Kit , if ever you should weary , come to me - no , do not come !
but send a word - and I shall know all , and you shall have your ring .
( GAUNT OPENS HIS BIBLE AND BEGINS TO READ . )


KIT .
Do n't say that , do n't say such things to me  I sink or swim with you .
( TO GAUNT . )
Old man , you 've struck me hard  give me a good word to go with .
Name your time  I 'll stand the test .
Give me a spark of hope , and I 'll fight through for it .
Say just this - ` Prove I was mistaken , ' and by George , I 'll prove it .


GAUNT ( LOOKING UP ) .
I make no such compacts .
Go , and swear not at all .


ARETHUSA .
Go , Kit !
I keep the ring .


SCENE IV


ARETHUSA , GAUNT


ARETHUSA .
Father , what have we done that you should be so cruel ?


GAUNT ( LAYING DOWN BIBLE , AND RISING ) .
Do you call me cruel ?
You speak after the flesh .
I have done you this day a service that you will live to bless me for upon your knees .


ARETHUSA .
He loves me , and I love him : you can never alter that  do what you will , father , that can never change .
I love him , I believe in him , I will be true to him .


GAUNT .
Arethusa , you are the sole thing death has left me on this earth  and I must watch over your carnal happiness and your eternal weal .
You do not know what this implies to me .
Your mother - my Hester - tongue can not tell , nor heart conceive the pangs she suffered .
If it lies in me , your life shall not be lost on that same reef of an ungodly husband .
( GOES OUT , C. )


SCENE V


ARETHUSA


ARETHUSA .
I thought the time dragged long and weary when I knew that Kit was homeward bound , all the white sails a-blowing out towards England , and my Kit 's face turned this way ?
( SHE BEGINS TO DUST . )
Sure , if my mother were here , she would understand and help us  she would understand a young maid 's heart , though her own had never an ache  and she would love my Kit .
( PUTTING BACK THE TELESCOPE . )
To think she died : husband and child - and so much love - she was taken from them all .
Ah , there is no parting but the grave !
And Kit and I both live , and both love each other  and here am I cast down ?
O , Arethusa , shame !
And your love home from the deep seas , and loving you still  and the sun shining  and the world all full of hope ?
O , hope , you 're a good word !


SCENE VI


ARETHUSA  TO HER , PEW


PEW ( SINGING WITHOUT ) -


` Time for us to go !
Time for us to go !
And we 'll keep the brig three pints away , For it 's time for us to go . '
ARETHUSA .
Who comes here ?
a seaman by his song , and father out !
( SHE TRIES THE AIR ) ` Time for us to go ! '
It sounds a wild kind of song .
( TAP-TAP  PEW PASSES THE WINDOW . )
O , what a face - and blind !


PEW ( ENTERING ) .
Kind Christian friends , take pity on a poor blind mariner , as lost his precious sight in the defence of his native country , England , and God bless King George !


ARETHUSA .
What can I do for you , sailor ?


PEW .
Good Christian lady , help a poor blind mariner to a mouthful of meat .
I 've served His Majesty in every quarter of the globe  I 've spoke with ` Awke and glorious Anson , as I might with you  and I 've tramped it all night long , upon my sinful feet , and with a empty belly .


ARETHUSA .
You shall not ask bread and be denied by a sailor 's daughter and a sailor 's sweetheart  and when my father returns he shall give you something to set you on your road .


PEW .
Kind and lovely lady , do you tell me that you are in a manner of speaking alone ?
or do my ears deceive a poor blind seaman ?


ARETHUSA .
I live here with my father , and my father is abroad .


PEW .
Dear , beautiful , Christian lady , tell a poor blind man your honoured name , that he may remember it in his poor blind prayers .


ARETHUSA .
Sailor , I am Arethusa Gaunt .


PEW .
Sweet lady , answer a poor blind man one other question : are you in a manner of speaking related to Cap'n John Gaunt ?
Cap'n John as in the ebony trade were known as Admiral Guinea ?


ARETHUSA .
Captain John Gaunt is my father .


PEW ( DROPPING THE BLIND MAN 'S WHINE ) .
Lord , think of that now !
They told me this was where he lived , and so it is .
And here 's old Pew , old David Pew , as was the Admiral 's own bo ` sun , colloguing in his old commander 's parlour , with his old commander 's gal ( SEIZES ARETHUSA ) .
Ah , and a bouncer you are , and no mistake .


ARETHUSA .
Let me go !
how dare you ?


PEW .
Lord love you , do n't you struggle , now , do n't you .
( SHE ESCAPES INTO FRONT R. CORNER , WHERE HE KEEPS HER IMPRISONED . )
Ah , well , we 'll get you again , my lovely woman .
What a arm you 've got - great god of love - and a face like a peach !
I 'm a judge , I am .
( SHE TRIES TO ESCAPE  HE STOPS HER . )
No , you do n't  O , I can hear a flea jump !
[ But it 's here where I miss my deadlights .
Poor old Pew  him as the ladies always would have for their fancy man and take no denial  here you are with your commander 's daughter close aboard , and you ca n't so much as guess the colour of her lovely eyes .
( SINGING ) -


` Be they black like ebony  Or be they blue like to the sky . '
Black like the Admiral 's ?
or blue like his poor dear wife 's ?
Ah , I was fond of that there woman , I was : the Admiral was jealous of me . ]
Arethusa , my dear , - my heart , what a ` and and arm you HAVE got  I 'll dream o ' that ` and and arm , I will !
- but as I was a-saying , does the Admiral ever in a manner of speaking refer to his old bo ` sun David Pew ?
him as he fell out with about the black woman at Lagos , and almost slashed the shoulder off of him one morning before breakfast ?


ARETHUSA .
You leave this house .


PEW .
Hey ?
( HE CROSSES AND SEIZES HER AGAIN ) Do n't you fight , my lovely one : now do n't make old blind Pew forget his manners before a female .
What !
you will ?
Stop that , or I 'll have the arm right out of your body .
( HE GIVES HER ARM A WRENCH . )


ARETHUSA .
O !
help , help !


PEW .
Stash your patter , damn you .
( ARETHUSA GIVES IN . )
Ah , I thought it : Pew 's way , Pew 's way .
Now , look you here , my lovely woman .
If you sling in another word that is n't in answer to my questions , I 'll pull your j' ints out one by one .
Where 's the Commander ?


ARETHUSA .
I have said : he is abroad .


PEW .
When 's he coming aboard again ?


ARETHUSA .
At any moment .


PEW .
Does he keep his strength ?


ARETHUSA .
You 'll see when he returns .
( HE WRENCHES HER ARM AGAIN . )
Ah !
PEW .
Is he still on piety ?


ARETHUSA .
O , he is a Christian man !


PEW .
A Christian man , is he ?
Where does he keep his rum ?


ARETHUSA .
Nay , you shall steal nothing by my help .


PEW .
No more I shall ( BECOMING AMOROUS ) .
You 're a lovely woman , that 's what you are  how would you like old Pew for a sweetheart , hey ?
He 's blind , is Pew , but strong as a lion  and the sex is his ` ole delight .
Ah , them beautiful , beautiful lips !
A kiss !
Come !


ARETHUSA .
Leave go , leave go !


PEW .
Hey ?
you would ?


ARETHUSA .
Ah !
( SHE THRUSTS HIM DOWN , AND ESCAPES TO DOOR , R. )


SCENE VII


PEW ( PICKING HIMSELF UP ) .
Ah , she 's a bouncer , she is !
Where 's my stick ?
That 's the sort of female for David Pew .
Did n't she fight ?
and did n't she struggle ?
and should n't I like to twist her lovely neck for her ?
Pew 's way with 'em all : the prettier they was , the uglier he were to 'em .
Pew 's way : a way he had with him  and a damned good way too .
( LISTENS AT L. DOOR . )
That 's her bedroom , I reckon  and she 's double-locked herself in .
Good again : it 's a crying mercy the Admiral did n't come in .
But you always loses your ` ed , Pew , with a female : that 's what charms 'em .
Now for business .
The front door .
No bar  only a big lock ( TRYING KEYS FROM HIS POCKET ) .
Key one  no go .
Key two  no go .
Key three  ah , that does it .
Ah !
( FEELING KEY ) him with the three wards and the little ` un : good again !
Now if I could only find a mate in this rotten country ` amlick : one to be eyes to me  I can steer , but I ca n't conn myself , worse luck !
If I could only find a mate !
And to-night , about three bells in the middle watch , old Pew will take a little cruise , and lay aboard his ancient friend the Admiral  or , barring that , the Admiral 's old sea-chest - the chest he kept the shiners in aboard the brig. Where is it , I wonder ?
in his berth , or in the cabin here ?
It 's big enough , and the brass bands is plain to feel by .
( SEARCHING ABOUT WITH STICK . )
Dresser - chair - ( KNOCKING HIS HEAD ON THE CUPBOARD . )
Ah !
- O , corner cupboard .
Admiral 's chair - Admiral 's table - Admiral 's - hey !
what 's this ?
- a book - sheepskin - smells like a ` oly Bible .
Chair ( HIS STICK JUST AVOIDS THE CHEST ) .
No sea-chest .
I must have a mate to see for me , to see for old Pew : him as had eyes like a eagle !
Meanwhile , rum .
Corner cupboard , of course ( TAP-TAPPING ) .
Rum - rum - rum .
Hey ?
( HE LISTENS . )
Footsteps .
Is it the Admiral ?
( WITH THE WHINE . )
Kind Christian friends -


SCENE VIII


PEW  to him GAUNT


GAUNT .
What brings you here ?


PEW .
Cap'n , do my ears deceive me ?
or is this my old commander ?


GAUNT .
My name is John Gaunt .
Who are you , my man , and what 's your business ?


PEW .
Here 's the facks , so help me .
A lovely female in this house was Christian enough to pity the poor blind  and lo and belold !
who should she turn out to be but my old commander 's daughter !
` My dear , ' says I to her , ' I was the Admiral 's own particular bo ` sun . '
- ` La , sailor , ' she says to me , ` how glad he 'll be to see you ! '
- ` Ah , ' says I , ` wo n't he just - that 's all . '
- ` I 'll go and fetch him , ' she says  ` you make yourself at ` ome . '
And off she went  and , Commander , here I am .


GAUNT ( SITTING DOWN ) .
Well ?


PEW .
Well , Cap'n ?


GAUNT .
What do you want ?


PEW .
Well , Admiral , in a general way , what I want in a manner of speaking is money and rum .
( A PAUSE . )


GAUNT .
David Pew , I have known you a long time .


PEW .
And so you have  aboard the old ARETHUSA  and you do n't seem that cheered up as I 'd looked for , with an old shipmate dropping in , one as has been seeking you two years and more - and blind at that .
Do n't you remember the old chantie ?
-


` Time for us to go , Time for us to go , And when we 'd clapped the hatches on , 'T was time for us to go .
What a note you had to sing , what a swaller for a pannikin of rum , and what a fist for the shiners !
Ah , Cap'n , they did n't call you Admiral Guinea for nothing .
I can see that old sea-chest of yours - her with the brass bands , where you kept your gold dust and doubloons : you know !
- I can see her as well this minute as though you and me was still at it playing put on the lid of her ... You do n't say nothing , Cap'n ?
... Well , here it is : I want money and I want rum .
You do n't know what it is to want rum , you do n't : it gets to that p ` int , that you would kill a ` ole ship 's company for just one guttle of it .
What ?
Admiral Guinea , my old Commander , go back on poor old Pew ?
and him high and dry ?
[ Not you !
When we had words over the negro lass at Lagos , what did you do ?
fair dealings was your word : fair as between man and man  and we had it out with p ` int and edge on Lagos sands .
And you 're not going back on your word to me , now I 'm old and blind ?
No , no !
belay that , I say .
Give me the old motto : Fair dealings , as between man and man . ]


GAUNT .
David Pew , it were better for you that you were sunk in fifty fathom .
I know your life  and first and last , it is one broadside of wickedness .
You were a porter in a school , and beat a boy to death  you ran for it , turned slaver , and shipped with me , a green hand .
Ay , that was the craft for you : that was the right craft , and I was the right captain  there was none worse that sailed to Guinea .
Well , what came of that ?
In five years ' time you made yourself the terror and abhorrence of your messmates .
The worst hands detested you  your captain - that was me , John Gaunt , the chief of sinners - cast you out for a Jonah .
[ Who was it stabbed the Portuguese and made off inland with his miserable wife ?
Who , raging drunk on rum , clapped fire to the baracoons and burned the poor soulless creatures in their chains ? ]
Ay , you were a scandal to the Guinea coast , from Lagos down to Calabar ?
and when at last I sent you ashore , a marooned man - your shipmates , devils as they were , cheering and rejoicing to be quit of you - by heaven , it was a ton 's weight off the brig !


PEW .
Cap'n Gaunt , Cap'n Gaunt , these are ugly words .


GAUNT .
What next ?
You shipped with Flint the Pirate .
What you did then I know not  the deep seas have kept the secret : kept it , ay , and will keep against the Great Day .
God smote you with blindness , but you heeded not the sign .
That was His last mercy  look for no more .
To your knees , man , and repent !
Pray for a new heart  flush out your sins with tears  flee while you may from the terrors of the wrath to come .


PEW .
Now , I want this clear : Do I understand that you 're going back on me , and you 'll see me damned first ?


GAUNT .
Of me you shall have neither money nor strong drink : not a guinea to spend in riot  not a drop to fire your heart with devilry .


PEW .
Cap'n , do you think it wise to quarrel with me ?
I put it to you now , Cap'n , fairly , as between man and man - do you think it wise ?


GAUNT .
I fear nothing .
My feet are on the Rock .
Begone !
( HE OPENS THE BIBLE AND BEGINS TO READ . )
PEW ( AFTER A PAUSE ) .
Well , Cap'n , you know best , no doubt  and David Pew 's about the last man , though I says it , to up and thwart an old Commander .
You 've been ` ard on David Pew , Cap'n : ` ard on the poor blind  but you 'll live to regret it - ah , my Christian friend , you 'll live to eat them words up .
But there 's no malice here : that ai n't Pew 's way  here 's a sailor 's hand upon it ... You do n't say nothing ?
( GAUNT TURNS A PAGE . )
Ah , reading , was you ?
Reading , by thunder !
Well , here 's my respecks ( SINGING ) -


` Time for us to go , Time for us to go , When the money 's out , and the liquor 's done , Why , it 's time for us to go .


( HE GOES TAPPING UP TO DOOR , TURNS ON THE THRESHOLD , AND LISTENS .
GAUNT TURNS A PAGE .
PEW , WITH A GRIMACE , STRIKES HIS HAND UPON THE POCKET WITH THE KEYS , AND GOES . )


DROP .

PEW  afterwards MRS. DRAKE , out and in .


PEW ( ENTERING ) .
Kind Christian friends - ( LISTENING  THEN DROPPING THE WHINE . )
Hey ?
nobody !
Hey ?
A grog-shop not two cable-lengths from the Admiral 's back-door , and the Admiral not there ?
I never knew a seaman brought so low : he ai n't but the bones of the man he used to be .
Bear away for the New Jerusalem , and this is what you run aground on , is it ?
Good again  but it ai n't Pew 's way  Pew 's way is rum .
- Sanded floor .
Rum is his word , and rum his motion .
- Settle - chimbley - settle again - spittoon - table rigged for supper .
Table-glass .

Brandy and water  and not enough of it to wet your eye  damn all greediness , I say .
Pot ( DRINKS ) , small beer - a drink that I ab ` or like bilge !
What I want is rum .

Halloa , there !
House , ahoy !


MRS. DRAKE ( WITHOUT ) .
Coming , sir , coming .
( SHE ENTERS , R. ) What can I do - ?
( SEEING PEW . )
Well I never did !
Now , beggar-man , what 's for you ?


[ PEW .
Rum , ma'am , rum  and a bit o ' supper .


MRS. DRAKE .
And a bed to follow , I should n't wonder !


PEW .
AND a bed to follow : IF you please . ]


MRS. DRAKE .
This is the ` ADMIRAL BENBOW , ' a respectable house , and receives none but decent company  and I 'll ask you to go somewhere else , for I do n't like the looks of you .


PEW .
Turn me away ?
Why , Lord love you , I 'm David Pew - old David Pew - him as was Benbow 's own particular cox ` n .
You would n't turn away old Pew from the sign of his late commander 's ` ed ?
Ah , my British female , you 'd have used me different if you 'd seen me in the fight !
[ There laid old Benbow , both his legs shot off , in a basket , and the blessed spy-glass at his eye to that same hour : a picter , ma'am , of naval daring : when a round shot come , and took and knocked a bucketful of shivers right into my poor daylights .
` Damme , ' says the Admiral , ` is that old Pew , MY old Pew ? '
he says .
- ` It 's old Pew , sir , ' says the first lootenant , ` worse luck , ' he says .
- ` Then damme , ' says Admiral Benbow , ` if that 's how they serve a lion - ` arted seaman , damme if I care to live , ' he says  and , ma'am , he laid down his spy-glass . ]


MRS. DRAKE .
Blind man , I do n't fancy you , and that 's the truth  and I 'll thank you to take yourself off .


PEW .
Thirty years have I fought for country and king , and now in my blind old age I 'm to be sent packing from a measly public - ` ouse ?
Mark ye , ma'am , if I go , you take the consequences .
Is this a inn ?
Or haint it ?
If it is a inn , then by act of parleyment , I 'm free to sling my ` ammick .
Do n't you forget : this is a act of parleyment job , this is .
You look out .


MRS. DRAKE .
Why , what 's to do with the man and his acts of parliament ?
I do n't want to fly in the face of an act of parliament , not I .
If what you say is true -


PEW .
True ?
If there 's anything truer than a act of parleyment - Ah !
you ask the beak .
True ?
I 've that in my ` art as makes me wish it was n't .


MRS. DRAKE .
I do n't like to risk it .
I do n't like your looks , and you 're more sea-lawyer than seaman to my mind .
But I 'll tell you what : if you can pay , you can stay .
So there .


PEW .
No chink , no drink ?
That 's your motto , is it ?
Well , that 's sense .
Now , look here , ma'am , I ai n't beautiful like you  but I 'm good , and I 'll give you warrant for it .
Get me a noggin of rum , and suthin ' to scoff , and a penny pipe , and a half-a-foot of baccy  and there 's a guinea for the reckoning .
There 's plenty more in the locker  so bear a hand , and be smart .
I do n't like waiting  it ai n't my way .
( EXIT MRS. DRAKE , R. PEW SITS AT THE TABLE , R .
THE SETTLE CONCEALS HIM FROM ALL THE UPPER PART OF THE STAGE . )


MRS. DRAKE ( RE-ENTERING ) .
Here 's the rum , sailor .


PEW ( DRINKS ) .
Ah , rum !
That 's my sheet-anchor : rum and the blessed Gospel .
Do n't you forget that , ma'am : rum and the Gospel is old Pew 's sheet-anchor .
You can take for another while you 're about it  and , I say , short reckonings make long friends , hey ?
Where 's my change ?


MRS. DRAKE .
I 'm counting it now .
There , there it is , and thank you for your custom .
( SHE GOES OUT , R. )


PEW ( CALLING AFTER HER ) .
Do n't thank me , ma'am  thank the act of parleyment !
Rum , fourpence  two penny pieces and a Willi 'm - and - Mary tizzy makes a shilling  and a spade half-guinea is eleven and six ( RE-ENTER MRS. DRAKE WITH SUPPER , PIPE , ETC. )  and a blessed majesty George the First crown-piece makes sixteen and six  and two shilling bits is eighteen and six  and a new half-crown makes - no it do n't !
O , no !
Old Pew 's too smart a hand to be bammed with a soft half-tusheroon .


MRS. DRAKE ( CHANGING PIECE ) .
I 'm sure I did n't know it , sailor .


PEW ( TRYING NEW COIN BETWEEN HIS TEETH ) .
In course you did n't , my dear  but I did , and I thought I 'd mention it .
Is that my supper , hey ?
Do my nose deceive me ?
( SNIFFING AND FEELING . )
Cold duck ?
sage and onions ?
a round of double Gloster ?
and that noggin o ' rum ?
Why , I declare if I 'd stayed and took pot-luck with my old commander , Cap'n John Gaunt , he could n't have beat this little spread , as I 've got by act of parleyment .


MRS. DRAKE ( AT KNITTING ) .
Do you know the captain , sailor ?


PEW .
Know him ?
I was that man 's bos ` un , ma'am .
In the Guinea trade , we was known as ` Pew 's Cap'n , ' and ` Gaunt 's Bo ` sun , ' one for other like .
We was like two brothers , ma'am .
And a excellent cold duck , to be sure  and the rum lovely .


MRS. DRAKE .
If you know John Gaunt , you know his daughter Arethusa .
PEW .
What ?
Arethusa ?
Know her , says you ?
know her ?
Why , Lord love you , I was her god-father .
[ ` Pew , ' says Jack Gaunt to me , ` Pew , ' he says , ` you 're a man , ' he says  ' I like a man to be a man , ' says he , ` and damme , ' he says , ' I like YOU  and sink me , ' says he , ` if you do n't promise and vow in the name of that new-born babe , ' he says , ` why damme , Pew , ' says he , ` you 're not the man I take you for . ' ]
Yes , ma'am , I named that female  with my own ` ands I did  Arethusa , I named her  that was the name I give her  so now you know if I speak true .
And if you 'll be as good as get me another noggin of rum , why , we 'll drink her ` elth with three times three .
( EXIT MRS. DRAKE : PEW EATING .
MRS. DRAKE RE-ENTERING WITH RUM . )


[ MRS. DRAKE .
If what you say be true , sailor ( and I do n't say it is n't , mind ! )
, it 's strange that Arethusa and that godly man her father have never so much as spoke your name .


PEW .
Why , that 's so !
And why , says you ?
Why , when I dropped in and paid my respecks this morning , do you think she knew me ?
No more'n a babe unborn !
Why , ma'am , when I promised and vowed for her , I was the picter of a man-o ' - war 's man , I was : eye like a eagle  walked the deck in a hornpipe , foot up and foot down  v ` ice as mellow as rum  ` and upon ` art , and all the females took dead aback at the first sight , Lord bless 'em !
Know me ?
Not likely .
And as for me , when I found her such a lovely woman - by the feel of her ` and and arm !
- you might have knocked me down with a feather .
But here 's where it is , you see : when you 've been knocking about on blue water for a matter of two-and-forty year , shipwrecked here , and blown up there , and everywhere out of luck , and given over for dead by all your messmates and relations , why , what it amounts to is this : nobody knows you , and you hardly know yourself , and there you are  and I 'll trouble you for another noggin of rum .


MRS. DRAKE .
I think you 've had enough .


PEW .
I do n't  so bear a hand .
( EXIT MRS. DRAKE  PEW EMPTIES THE GLASS . )
Rum , ah , rum , you 're a lovely creature  they have n't never done you justice .
( PROCEEDS TO FILL AND LIGHT PIPE  RE-ENTER MRS. DRAKE WITH RUM . ) ]
And now , ma'am , since you 're so genteel and amicable-like , what about my old commander ?
Is he , in a manner of speaking , on half pay ?
or is he living on his fortune , like a gentleman slaver ought ?


MRS. DRAKE .
Well , sailor , people talk , you know .


PEW .
I know , ma'am  I 'd have been rolling in my coach , if they 'd have held their tongues .


MRS. DRAKE .
And they do say that Captain Gaunt , for so pious a man , is little better than a miser .


PEW .
Do n't say it , ma'am  not to old Pew .
Ah , how often have I up and strove with him !
` Cap'n , live it down , ' says I. ` Ah , Pew , ' says he , ` you 're a better man than I am , ' he says  ` but dammne , ' he says , ` money , ' he says , ` is like rum to me . '
( INSINUATING . )
And what about a old sea-chest , hey ?
a old sea-chest , strapped with brass bands ?


MRS. DRAKE .
Why , that 'll be the chest in his parlour , where he has it bolted to the wall , as I 've seen with my own eyes  and so might you , if you had eyes to see with .


PEW .
No , ma'am , that ai n't good enough  you do n't bam old Pew .
You never was in that parlour in your life .
MRS. DRAKE .
I never was ?
Well , I declare !


PEW .
Well then , if you was , where 's the chest ?
Beside the chimbley , hey ?
( WINKING . )
Beside the table with the ` oly Bible ?


MRS. DRAKE .
No , sailor , you do n't get any information out of me .


PEW .
What , ma'am ?
Not to old Pew ?
Why , my god-child showed it me herself , and I told her where she 'd find my name - P , E , W , Pew - cut out on the starn of it  and sure enough she did .
Why , ma'am , it was his old money-box when he was in the Guinea trade  and they do say he keeps the rhino in it still .


MRS. DRAKE .
No , sailor , nothing out of me !
And if you want to know , you can ask the Admiral himself !
( SHE CROSSES , L. )


PEW .
Hey ?
Old girl fly ?
Then I reckon I must have a mate , if it was the parish bull .


SCENE II


TO THESE , KIT , A LITTLE DRUNK


KIT ( LOOKING IN OVER HALF-DOOR ) .
Mrs. Drake !
Mother !
Where are you ?
Come and welcome the prodigal !


MRS. DRAKE ( COMING FORWARD TO MEET HIM AS HE ENTERS  PEW REMAINS CONCEALED BY THE SETTLE , SMOKING , DRINKING , AND LISTENING ) .
Lord bless us and save us , if it ai n't my boy !
Give us a kiss .


KIT .
That I will , and twenty if you like , old girl .
( KISSES HER . )
MRS. DRAKE .
O Kit , Kit , you 've been at those other houses , where the stuff they give you , my dear , it is poison for a dog .


[ KIT .
Round with friends , mother : only round with friends .


MRS. DRAKE .
Well , anyway , you 'll take a glass just to settle it , from me .
( SHE BRINGS THE BOTTLE , AND FILLS FOR HIM . )
There , that 's pure  that 'll do you no harm . ]
But O , Kit , Kit , I thought you were done with all this Jack-a-shoring .


KIT .
What cheer , mother ?
I 'm only a sheet in the wind  and who 's the worse for it but me ?


MRS. DRAKE .
Ah , and that dear young lady  and her waiting and keeping single these two years for the love of you !


KIT .
She , mother ?
she 's heart of oak , she 's true as steel , and good as gold  and she has my ring on her finger , too .
But where 's the use ?
The Admiral wo n't look at me .


MRS. DRAKE .
Why not ?
You 're as good a man as him any day .


KIT .
Am I ?
He says I 'm a devil , and swears that none of his flesh and blood - that 's what he said , mother !
- should lie at my mercy .
That 's what cuts me .
If it was n't for the good stuff I 've been taking aboard , and the jolly companions I 've been seeing it out with , I 'd just go and make a hole in the water , and be done with it , I would , by George !


MRS. DRAKE .
That 's like you men .
Ah , we know you , we that keeps a public-house - we know you , good and bad : you go off on a frolic and forget  and you never think of the women that sit crying at home .


KIT .
Crying ?
Arethusa cry ?
Why , dame , she 's the bravest-hearted girl in all broad England !
Here , fill the glass !
I 'll win her yet .
I drink to her  here 's to her bright eyes , and here 's to the blessed feet she walks upon !


PEW ( LOOKING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE SETTLE ) .
Spoke like a gallant seaman , every inch .
Shipmate , I 'm a man as has suffered , and I 'd like to shake your fist , and drink a can of flip with you .


KIT ( COMING DOWN ) .
Hullo , my hearty !
who the devil are you ?
Who 's this , mother ?
MRS. DRAKE .
Nay , I know nothing about him .
( SHE GOES OUT , R. )


PEW .
Cap'n , I 'm a brother seaman , and my name is Pew , old David Pew , as you may have heard of in your time , he having sailed along of ` Awke and glorious Benbow , and a right - ` and man to both .


KIT .
Benbow ?
Steady , mate !
D' ye mean to say you went to sea before you were born ?


PEW .
See now !
The sign of this here inn was running in my ` ed , I reckon .
Benbow , says you ?
no , not likely !
Anson , I mean  Anson and Sir Edward ` Awke : that 's the pair : I was their right - ` and man .
KIT .
Well , mate , you may be all that , and more  but you 're a rum un to look at , anyhow .


PEW .
Right you are , and so I am .
But what is looks ?
It 's the ` art that does it : the ` art is the seaman 's star  and here 's old David Pew 's , a matter of fifty years at sea , but tough and sound as the British Constitootion .


KIT .
You 're right there , Pew .
Shake hands upon it .
And you 're a man they 're down upon , just like myself , I see .
We 're a pair of plain , good-hearted , jolly tars  and all these ` longshore fellows cock a lip at us , by George .
What cheer , mate ?


ARETHUSA ( WITHOUT ) .
Mrs. Drake !
Mrs. Drake !


PEW .
What , a female ?
hey ?
a female ?
Board her board her , mate !
I 'm dark .
( HE RETIRES AGAIN BEHIND , TO TABLE , R. , BEHIND SETTLE . )
ARETHUSA ( WITHOUT ) .
Mrs. Drake !


MRS. DRAKE ( RE-ENTERING AND RUNNING TO DOOR ) .
Here I am , my dear  come in .


SCENE III


TO THESE , ARETHUSA


ARETHUSA .
Ah , Kit , I 've found you .
I thought you would lodge with Mrs. Drake .


KIT .
What ?
are you looking for your consort ?
Whistle , I 'm your dog  I 'll come to you .
I 've been toasting you fathom deep , my beauty  and with every glass I love you dearer .


ARETHUSA .
Now Kit , if you want to please my father , this is not the way .
Perhaps he thinks too much of the guineas : well , gather them - if you think me worth the price .
Go you to your sloop , clinker built , eighty tons burthen - you see I remember , Skipper Kit !
I do n't deny I like a man of spirit  but if you care to please Captain Gaunt , keep out of taverns  and if you could carry yourself a bit more - more elderly !


[ KIT .
Can I ?
Would I ?
Ah , just could n't and just wo n't I , then !


MRS. DRAKE .
I hope , madam , you do n't refer to my house  a publican I may be , but tavern is a word that I do n't hold with  and here there 's no bad drink , and no loose company  and as for my blessedest Kit , I declare I love him like my own .


ARETHUSA .
Why , who could help it , Mrs. Drake ? ]


KIT .
Arethusa , you 're an angel .
Do I want to please Captain Gaunt ?
Why , that 's as much as ask whether I love you .
[ I do n't deny that his words cut me  for they did .
But as for wanting to please him , if he was deep as the blue Atlantic , I would beat it out .
And elderly , too ?
Aha , you witch , you 're wise !
Elderly ?
You 've set the course  you leave me alone to steer it .
Matrimony 's my port , and love is my cargo . ]
That 's a likely question , ai n't it , Mrs. Drake ?
Do I want to please him !
Elderly , says you ?
Why , see here : Fill up my glass , and I 'll drink to Arethusa on my knees .


ARETHUSA .
Why , you stupid boy , do you think that would please him ?


KIT .
On my knees I 'll drink it !
( AS HE KNEELS AND DRAINS THE GLASS , GAUNT ENTERS , AND HE SCRAMBLES TO HIS FEET . )
SCENE IV


TO THESE , GAUNT


GAUNT .
Arethusa , this is no place for you .


ARETHUSA .
No , father .


GAUNT .
I wish you had been spared this sight  but look at him , child , since you are here  look at God 's image , so debased .
And you , young man ( TO KIT ) , you have proved that I was right .
Are you the husband for this innocent maid ?


KIT .
Captain Gaunt , I have a word to say to you .
Terror is your last word  you 're bitter hard upon poor sinners , bitter hard and black - you that were a sinner yourself .
These are not the true colours : do n't deceive yourself  you 're out of your course .


[ GAUNT .
Heaven forbid that I should be hard , Christopher .
It is not I  it 's God 's law that is of iron .
Think !
if the blow were to fall now , some cord to snap within you , some enemy to plunge a knife into your heart  this room , with its poor taper light , to vanish  this world to disappear like a drowning man into the great ocean  and you , your brain still whirling , to be snatched into the presence of the eternal Judge : Christopher French , what answer would you make ?
For these gifts wasted , for this rich mercy scorned , for these high-handed bravings of your better angel , - what have you to say ?


KIT .
Well , sir , I want my word with you , and by your leave I 'll have it out .


ARETHUSA .
Kit , for pity 's sake !


KIT .
Arethusa , I do n't speak to you , my dear : you 've got my ring , and I know what that means .
The man I speak to is Captain Gaunt .
I came to-day as happy a man as ever stepped , and with as fair a look-out .
What did you care ?
what was your reply ?
None of your flesh and blood , you said , should lie at the mercy of a wretch like me !
Am I not flesh and blood that you should trample on me like that ?
Is that charity , to stamp the hope out of a poor soul ? ]


GAUNT .
You speak wildly  or the devil of drink that is in you speaks instead .


KIT .
You think me drunk ?
well , so I am , and whose fault is it but yours ?
It was I that drank  but you take your share of it , Captain Gaunt : you it was that filled the can .


GAUNT .
Christopher French , I spoke but for your good , your good and hers .
` Woe unto him ' - these are the dreadful words - ` by whom offences shall come : it were better - ' Christopher , I can but pray for both of us .


KIT .
Prayers ?
Now I tell you freely , Captain Gaunt , I do n't value your prayers .
Deeds are what I ask  kind deeds and words - that 's the true-blue piety : to hope the best and do the best , and speak the kindest .
As for you , you insult me to my face  and then you 'll pray for me ?
What 's that ?
Insult behind my back is what I call it !
No , sir  you 're out of the course  you 're no good man to my view , be you who you may .


MRS. DRAKE .
O Christopher !
To Captain Gaunt ?


ARETHUSA .
Father , father , come away !


KIT .
Ah , you see ?
She suffers too  we all suffer .
You spoke just now of a devil  well , I 'll tell you the devil you have : the devil of judging others .
And as for me , I 'll get as drunk as Bacchus .


GAUNT .
Come !


SCENE V


PEW , MRS. DRAKE , KIT


PEW ( COMING OUT AND WAVING HIS PIPE ) .
Commander , shake !
Hooray for old England !
If there 's anything in the world that goes to old Pew 's ` art , it 's argyment .
Commander , you handled him like a babby , kept the weather gauge , and hulled him every shot .
Commander , give it a name , and let that name be rum !


KIT .
Ay , rum 's the sailor 's fancy .
Mrs. Drake , a bottle and clean glasses .


MRS. DRAKE .
Kit French , I would n't .
Think better of it , there 's a dear !
And that sweet girl just gone !


PEW .
Ma'am , I 'm not a ` ard man  I 'm not the man to up and force a act of parleyment upon a helpless female .
But you see here : Pew 's friends is sacred .
Here 's my friend here , a perfeck seaman , and a man with a ` ed upon his shoulders , and a man that , damme , I admire .
He give you a order , ma'am : - march !


MRS. DRAKE .
Kit , do n't you listen to that blind man  he 's the devil wrote upon his face .


PEW .
Do n't you insinuate against my friend .
HE ai n't a child , I hope ?
HE knows his business ?
Do n't you get trying to go a lowering of my friend in his own esteem .


MRS. DRAKE .
Well , I 'll bring it , Kit  but it 's against the grain .
( EXIT . )


KIT .
I say , old boy , come to think of it , why should we ?
It 's been glasses round with me all day .
I 've got my cargo .


PEW .
You ?
and you just argy'd the ` ed off of Admiral Guinea ?
O stash that !
I stand treat , if it comes to that !


KIT .
What !
Do I meet with a blind seaman and not stand him ?
That 's not the man I am !
MRS. DRAKE ( RE-ENTERING WITH BOTTLE AND GLASSES ) .
There !


PEW .
Easy does it , ma'am .


KIT .
Mrs. Drake , you had better trot .


MRS. DRAKE .
Yes , I 'll trot  and I trot with a sick heart , Kit French , to leave you drinking your wits away with that low blind man .
For a low man you are - a low blind man - and your clothes they would disgrace a scarecrow .
I 'll go to my bed , Kit  and O , dear boy , go soon to yours - the old room , you know  it 's ready for you - and go soon and sleep it off  for you know , dear , they , one and all , regret it in the morning  thirty years I 've kept this house , and one and all they did regret it , dear .


PEW .
Come now , you walk !


MRS. DRAKE .
O , it 's not for your bidding .
You a seaman ?
The ship for you to sail in is the hangman 's cart .
- Good-night , Kit dear , and better company !


SCENE VI


PEW , KIT .
They sit at the other table , L .


PEW .
Commander , here 's HER ` ealth !


KIT .
Ay , that 's the line : HER health !
But that old woman there is a good old woman , Pew .


PEW .
So she is , Commander .
But there 's no woman understands a seaman  now you and me , being both bred to it , we splice by natur ' .
As for A. G. , if argyment can win her , why , she 's yours .
If I 'd a-had your ` ed for argyment , damme , I 'd a-been a Admiral , I would !
And if argyment wo n't win her , well , see here , you put your trust in David Pew .


KIT .
David Pew , I do n't know who you are , David Pew  I never heard of you  I do n't seem able to clearly see you .
Mrs. Drake , she 's a smart old woman , Pew , and she says you 've the devil in your face .


PEW .
Ah , and why , says you ?
Because I up and put her in her place , when she forgot herself to you , Commander .


KIT .
Well , Pew , that 's so  you stood by me like a man .
Shake hands , Pew  and we 'll make a night of it , or we 'll know why , old boy !


PEW .
That 's my way .
That 's Pew 's way , that is .
That 's Pew 's way all over .
Commander , excuse the liberty  but when I was your age , making allowance for a lowlier station and less ` ed for argyment , I was as like you as two peas .
I know it by the v ` ice ( SINGS ) -


` We had n't been three days at sea before we saw a sail , So we clapped on every stitch would stand , although it blew a gale , And we walked along full fourteen knots , for the barkie she did know As well as ever a soul on board , 't was time for us to go . '
Chorus , Cap'n !


PEW AND KIT ( IN CHORUS ) -


` Time for us to go , Time for us to go , As well as ever a soul on board , 'T was time for us to go . '
PEW ( SINGS ) -


` We carried away the royal yard , and the stunsail boom was gone  Says the skipper , `` They may go or stand , I 'm damned if I do n't crack on  So the weather braces we 'll round in , and the trysail set also , And we 'll keep the brig three p ` ints away , for it 's time for us to go .
Give it mouth , Commander !


PEW AND KIT ( IN CHORUS ) -


` Time for us to go , Time for us to go , And we 'll keep the brig three p ` ints away , For it 's time for us to go . '
PEW .
I ai n't sung like that since I sang to Admiral ` Awke , the night before I lost my eyes , I ai n't .
` Sink me ! '
says he , says Admiral ` Awke , my old commander ( TOUCHING HIS HAT ) , ` sink me ! '
he says , ` if that ai n't ` art-of-oak , ' he says : '' art-of-oak , ' says he , ` and a pipe like a bloody blackbird ! '
Commander , here 's my respecks , and the devil fly away with Admiral Guinea !


KIT .
I say , Pew , how 's this ?
How do you know about Admiral Guinea ?
I say , Pew , I begin to think you know too much .
PEW .
I ax your pardon  but as a man with a ` ed for argyment - and that 's your best p ` int o ' sailing , Commander  intelleck is your best p ` int - as a man with a ` ed for argyment , how do I make it out ?


KIT .
Aha , you 're a sly dog , you 're a deep dog , Pew  but you ca n't get the weather of Kit French .
How do I make it out ?
I 'll tell you .
I make it out like this : Your name 's Pew , ai n't it ?
Very well .
And you know Admiral Guinea , and that 's his name , eh ?
Very well .
Then you 're Pew  and the Admiral 's the Admiral  and you know the Admiral  and by George , that 's all .
Hey ?
Drink about , boys , drink about !


PEW .
Lord love you , if I 'd a-had a ` ed like yours !
Why the Admiral was my first cap'n .
I was that man 's bo ` sun , I was , aboard the ARETHUSA  and we was like two brothers .
Did you never hear of Guinea-land and the black ivory business ?
( SINGS ) -


' A quick run to the south we had , and when we made the Bight We kept the offing all day long and crossed the bar at night .
Six hundred niggers in the hold and seventy we did stow , And when we 'd clapped the hatches on , 't was time for us to go . '
Lay forward , lads !


KIT AND PEW ( IN CHORUS ) -


` Time for us to go , ' etc. .


KIT .
I say , Pew , I like you  you 're a damned ugly dog  but I like you .
But look ye here , Pew : fair does it , you know , or we part company this minute .
If you and the Ad - the Admirable were like brothers on the Guinea coast , why are n't you like brothers here ?


PEW .
Ah , I see you coming .
What a ` ed !
what a ` ed !
Since Pew is a friend of the family , says you , why did n't he sail in and bear a hand , says you , when you was knocking the Admiral 's ship about his ears in argyment ?


KIT .
Well , Pew , now you put a name to it , why not ?


PEW .
Ah , why not ?
There I recko ` nise you .
[ Well , see here : argyment 's my weakness , in a manner of speaking  I would n't a-borne down and spiled sport , not for gold untold , no , not for rum , I would n't !
And besides , Commander , I put it to you , as between man and man , would it have been seaman-like to let on and show myself to a old shipmate , when he was yard-arm to yard-arm with a craft not half his metal , and getting blown out of water every broadside ?
Would it have been ` ansome ?
I put it to you , as between man and man .


KIT .
Pew , I may have gifts  but I never thought of that .
Why , no : not seaman-like .
Pew , you 've a heart  that 's what I like you for .


PEW .
Ah , that I have : you 'll see .
I wanted - now you follow me - I wanted to keep square with Admiral Guinea . ]
Why ?
says you .
Well , put it that I know a fine young fellow when I sees him  and put it that I wish him well  and put it , for the sake of argyment , that the father of that lovely female 's in my power .
Aha ?
Pew 's Power !
Why , in my ` ands he 's like this pocket ` andke ` cher .
Now , brave boy , do you see ?


KIT .
No , Pew , my head 's gone  I do n't see .


PEW .
Why , cheer up , Commander !
You want to marry this lovely female ?


KIT .
Ay , that I do  but I 'm not fit for her , Pew  I 'm a drunken dog , and I 'm not fit for her .


PEW .
Now , Cap'n , you 'll allow a old seaman to be judge : one as sailed with ` Awke and blessed Benb - with ` Awke and noble Anson .
You 've been open and above-board with me , and I 'll do the same by you : it being the case that you 're hard hit about a lovely woman , which many a time and oft it has happened to old Pew  and him with a feeling ` art that bleeds for you , Commander  why look here : I 'm that girl 's godfather  promised and vowed for her , I did  and I like you  and you 're the man for her  and , by the living Jacob , you shall splice !


KIT .
David Pew , do you mean what you say ?


PEW .
Do I mean what I say ?
Does David Pew ?
Ask Admiral ` Awke !
Ask old Admiral Byng in his coffin , where I laid him with these lands !
Pew does , is what those naval commanders would reply .
Mean it ?
I reckon so .
KIT .
Then , shake hands .
You 're an honest man , Pew - old Pew !
- and I 'll make your fortune .
But there 's something else , if I could keep the run of it .
O , ah !
But CAN you ?
That 's the point .
Can you  do n't you see ?


PEW .
Can I ?
You leave that to me  I 'll bring you to your moorings  I 'm the man that can , and I 'm him that will .
But only , look here , let 's understand each other .
You 're a bold blade , ai n't you ?
You wo n't stick at a trifle for a lovely female ?
You 'll back me up ?
You 're a man , ai n't you ?
a man , and you 'll see me through and through it , hey ?
Come  is that so ?
Are you fair and square and stick at nothing ?


KIT .
Me , Pew ?
I 'll go through fire and water .


PEW .
I 'll risk it .
- Well , then , see here , my son : another swallow and we jog .


KIT .
No , not to-night , Pew , not to-night !


PEW .
Commander , in a manner of speaking , wherefore ?


KIT .
Wherefore , Pew ?
'Cause why , Pew ?
'Cause I 'm drunk , and be damned to you !


PEW .
Commander , I ax your pardon  but , saving your presence , that 's a lie .
What ?
drunk ?
a man with a ` ed for argyment like that ?
just you get up , and steady yourself on your two pins , and you 'll be as right as ninepence .


[ KIT .
Pew , before we budge , let me shake your flipper again .
You 're heart of oak , Pew , sure enough  and if you can bring the Adam - Admirable about , why , damme , I 'll make your fortune !
How you 're going to do it , I do n't know  but I 'll stand by  and I know you 'll do it if anybody can .
But I 'm drunk , Pew  you ca n't deny that : I 'm as drunk as a Plymouth fiddler , Pew  and how you 're going to do it is a mystery to me .


PEW .
Ah , you leave that to me .
All I want is what I 've got : your promise to stand by and bear a hand ( PRODUCING A DARK LANTERN ) . ]
Now , here , you see , is my little glim  it ai n't for me , because I 'm blind , worse luck !
and the day and night is the blessed same to David Pew .
But you watch .
You put the candle near me .
Here 's what there ai n't mony blind men could do , take the pick o ' them !
( LIGHTING A SCREW OF PAPER , AND WITH THAT , THE LANTERN ) .
Hey ?
That 's it .
Hey ?
Go and pity the poor blind !


KIT ( WHILE PEW BLOWS OUT THE CANDLES ) .
But I say , Pew , what do you want with it ?


PEW .
To see by , my son .
( HE SHUTS THE LANTERN AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET .

All ship-shape ?
No sparks about ?
No ?

SCENE I


ARETHUSA , GAUNT


[ GAUNT ( READING ) .
` And Ruth said , Intreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee : for whither thou goest , I will go  and where thou lodgest , I will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God : Where thou diest , will I die , and there will I be buried : the Lord do so to me , and more also , if aught but death part thee and me . '
( HE CLOSES THE BOOK . )
Amen .


ARETHUSA .
Amen .
Father , there spoke my heart . ]


GAUNT .
Arethusa , the Lord in his mercy has seen right to vex us with trials of many kinds .
It is a little matter to endure the pangs of the flesh : the smart of wounds , the passion of hunger and thirst , the heaviness of disease  and in this world I have learned to take thought for nothing save the quiet of your soul .
It is through our affections that we are smitten with the true pain , even the pain that kills .


ARETHUSA .
And yet this pain is our natural lot .
Father , I fear to boast , but I know that I can bear it .
Let my life , then , flow like common lives , each pain rewarded with some pleasure , each pleasure linked with some pain : nothing pure whether for good or evil : and my husband , like myself and all the rest of us , only a poor , kind-hearted sinner , striving for the better part .
What more could any woman ask ?


GAUNT .
Child , child , your words are like a sword .
What would she ask ?
Look upon me whom , in the earthly sense , you are commanded to respect .
Look upon me : do I bear a mark ?
is there any outward sign to bid a woman avoid and flee from me ?


ARETHUSA .
I see nothing but the face I love .


GAUNT .
There is none : nor yet on the young man Christopher , whose words still haunt and upbraid me .
Yes , I am hard  I was born hard , born a tyrant , born to be what I was , a slaver captain .
But to-night , and to save you , I will pluck my heart out of my bosom .
You shall know what makes me what I am  you shall hear , out of my own life , why I dread and deprecate this marriage .
Child , do you remember your mother ?


ARETHUSA .
Remember her ?
Ah , if she had been here to-day !


GAUNT .
It is thirteen years since she departed , and took with her the whole sunshine of my life .
Do you remember the manner of her departure ?
You were a child , and can not  but I can and do .
Remember ?
shall I ever forget ?
Here or hereafter , ever forget !
Ten years she was my wife , and ten years she lay a-dying .
Arethusa , she was a saint on earth  and it was I that killed her .


ARETHUSA .
Killed her ?
my mother ?
You ?


GAUNT .
Not with my hand  for I loved her .
I would not have hurt one hair upon her head .
But she got her death by me , as sure as by a blow .


ARETHUSA .
I understand - I can see : you brood on trifles , misunderstandings , unkindnesses you think them  though my mother never knew of them , or never gave them a second thought .
It is natural , when death has come between .


GAUNT .
I married her from Falmouth .
She was comely as the roe  I see her still - her dove 's eyes and her smile !
I was older than she  and I had a name for hardness , a hard and wicked man  but she loved me - my Hester !
- and she took me as I was .
O how I repaid her trust !
Well , our child was born to us  and we named her after the brig I had built and sailed , the old craft whose likeness - older than you , girl - stands there above our heads .
And so far , that was happiness .
But she yearned for my salvation  and it was there I thwarted her .
My sins were a burden upon her spirit , a shame to her in this world , her terror in the world to come .
She talked much and often of my leaving the devil 's trade I sailed in .
She had a tender and a Christian heart , and she would weep and pray for the poor heathen creatures that I bought and sold and shipped into misery , till my conscience grew hot within me .
I 've put on my hat , and gone out and made oath that my next cargo should be my last  but it never was , that oath was never kept .
So I sailed again and again for the Guinea coast , until the trip came that was to be my last indeed .
Well , it fell out that we had good luck trading , and I stowed the brig with these poor heathen as full as she would hold .
We had a fair run westward till we were past the line  but one night the wind rose and there came a hurricane , and for seven days we were tossed on the deep seas , in the hardest straits , and every hand on deck .
For several days they were battened down : all that time we heard their cries and lamentations , but worst at the beginning  and when at last , and near dead myself , I crept below - O !
some they were starved , some smothered , some dead of broken limbs  and the hold was like a lazar-house in the time of the anger of the Lord !


ARETHUSA .
O !


GAUNT .
It was two hundred and five that we threw overboard : two hundred and five lost souls that I had hurried to their doom .
I had many die with me before  but not like that - not such a massacre as that  and I stood dumb before the sight .
For I saw I was their murderer - body and soul their murderer  and , Arethusa , my Hester knew it .
That was her death-stroke : it felled her .
She had long been dying slowly  but from the hour she heard that story , the garment of the flesh began to waste and perish , the fountains of her life dried up  she faded before my face  and in two months from my landing - O Hester , Hester , would God I had died for thee !


ARETHUSA .
Mother !
O poor soul !
O poor father !
O father , it was hard on you .


GAUNT .
The night she died , she lay there , in her bed .
She took my hand . '
I am going , ' she said , ` to heaven .
For Christ 's sake , ' she said , ` come after me , and bring my little maid .
I 'll be waiting and wearying till you come  ' and she kissed my hand , the hand that killed her .
At that I broke out calling on her to stop , for it was more than I could bear .
But no , she said she must still tell me of my sins , and how the thought of them had bowed down her life .
` And O ! '
she said , ` if I could n't prevail on you alive , let my death . '
... Well , then , she died .
What have I done since then ?
I 've laid my course for Hester .
Sin , temptation , pleasure , all this poor shadow of a world , I saw them not : I saw my Hester waiting , waiting and wearying .
I have made my election sure  my sins I have cast them out .
Hester , Hester , I will come to you , poor waiting one  and I 'll bring your little maid : ay , dearest soul , I 'll bring your little maid safe with me !


ARETHUSA .
O teach me how !
Show me the way !
only show me .
- O mother , mother !
- If it were paved with fire , show me the way , and I will walk it bare-foot !


GAUNT .
They call me a miser .
They say that in this sea-chest of mine I hoard my gold .
( HE PASSES R. TO CHEST , TAKES OUT KEY , AND UNLOCKS IT . )
They think my treasure and my very soul are locked up here .
They speak after the flesh , but they are right .
See !


ARETHUSA .
Her watch ?
the wedding ring ?
O father , forgive me !


GAUNT .
Ay , her watch that counted the hours when I was away  they were few and sorrowful , my Hester 's hours  and this poor contrivance numbered them .
The ring - with that I married her .
This chain , it 's of Guinea gold  I brought it home for her , the year before we married , and she wore it to her wedding .
It was a vanity : they are all vanities  but they are the treasure of my soul .
Below here , see , her wedding dress .
Ay , the watch has stopped : dead , dead .
And I know that my Hester died of me  and day and night , asleep and awake , my soul abides in her remembrance .


ARETHUSA .
And you come in your sleep to look at them .
O poor father !
I understand - I understand you now .


GAUNT .
In my sleep ?
Ay ?
do I so ?
My Hester !


ARETHUSA .
And why , why did you not tell me ?
I thought - I was like the rest !
- I feared you were a miser .
O , you should have told me  I should have been so proud - so proud and happy .
I knew you loved her  but not this , not this .


GAUNT .
Why should I have spoken ?
It was all between my Hester and me .


ARETHUSA .
Father , may I speak ?
May I tell you what my heart tells me ?
You do not understand about my mother .
You loved her - O , as few men can love .
And she loved you : think how she loved you !
In this world , you know - you have told me - there is nothing perfect .
All we men and women have our sins  and they are a pain to those that love us , and the deeper the love , the crueller the pain .
That is life  and it is life we ask , not heaven  and what matter for the pain , if only the love holds on ?
Her love held : then she was happy !
Her love was immortal  and when she died , her one grief was to be parted from you , her one hope to welcome you again .


GAUNT .
And you , Arethusa : I was to bring her little maid .


ARETHUSA .
God bless her , yes , and me !
But , father , can you not see that she was blessed among women ?


GAUNT .
Child , child , you speak in ignorance  you touch upon griefs you can not fathom .


ARETHUSA .
No , dearest , no .
She loved you , loved you and died of it .
Why else do women live ?
What would I ask but just to love my Kit and die for him , and look down from heaven , and see him keep my memory holy and live the nobler for my sake ?


GAUNT .
Ay , do you so love him ?


ARETHUSA .
Even as my mother loved my father .


GAUNT .
Ay ?
Then we will see .
What right have I - You are your mother 's child : better , tenderer , wiser than I. Let us seek guidance in prayer .
Good-night , my little maid .


ARETHUSA .
O father , I know you at last .


SCENE II


GAUNT and ARETHUSA go out , L. , carrying the candles .
Stage dark .


A distant clock chimes the quarters , and strikes one .
Then , the tap-tapping of Pew 's stick is hear without  the key is put into the lock  and enter PEW , C. , he pockets key , and is followed by KIT , with dark lantern


PEW .
Quiet , you lubber !
Ca n't you foot it soft , you that has daylights and a glim ?


KIT .
All right , old boy .
How the devil did we get through the door ?
Shall I knock him up ?


PEW .
Stow your gab ( SEIZING HIS WRIST ) .
Under your breath !


KIT .
Avast that !
You 're a savage dog , are n't you ?


PEW .
Turn on that glim .


KIT .
It 's as right as a trivet , Pew .
What next ?
By George , Pew , I 'll make your fortune .
PEW .
Here , now , look round this room , and sharp .
D' ye see a old sea-chest ?


KIT .
See it , Pew ?
why , d' ye think I 'm blind ?


PEW .
Take me across , and let me feel of her .
Mum  catch my hand .
Ah , that 's her ( FEELING THE CHEST ) , that 's the Golden Mary .
Now , see here , my bo , if you 've the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit , this girl is yours  if you hai n't , and think to sheer off , I 'm blind , but I 'm deadly .


KIT .
You 'll keep a civil tongue in your head all the same .
I 'll take threats from nobody , blind or not .
Let 's knock up the Admiral and be done with it .
What I want is to get rid of this dark lantern .
It makes me feel like a housebreaker , by George .


PEW ( SEATED ON CHEST ) .
You follow this .
I 'm sick of drinking bilge , when I might be rolling in my coach , and I 'm dog-sick of Jack Gaunt .
Who 's he to be wallowing in gold , when a better man is groping crusts in the gutter and spunging for rum ?
Now , here in this blasted chest is the gold to make men of us for life : gold , ay , gobs of it  and writin 's too - things that if I had the proof of 'em I 'd hold Jack Gaunt to the grindstone till his face was flat .
I 'd have done it single-handed  but I 'm blind , worse luck : I 'm all in the damned dark here , poking with a stick - Lord , burn up with lime the eyes that saw it !
That 's why I raked up you .
Come , out with your iron , and prise the lid off .
You shall touch your snack , and have the wench for nothing  ay , and fling her in the street , when done .


KIT .
So you brought me here to steal did you ?


PEW .
Ay did I  and you shall .
I 'm a biter : I bring blood .


KIT .
Now , Pew , you came here on my promise , or I 'd kill you like a rat .
As it is , out of that door !
One , two , three ( DRAWING HIS CUTLASS ) , and off !


PEW ( LEAPING AT HIS THROAT , AND WITH A GREAT VOICE ) .
Help !
murder !
thieves !


SCENE III


To these , ARETHUSA , GAUNT , with lights .
Stage light .
PEW has KIT down , and is throttling him PEW .
I 've got him , Cap'n .
What , kill my old commander , and rob him of his blessed child ?
Not with old Pew !


GAUNT .
Get up , David : ca n't you see you 're killing him ?
Unhand , I say .
ARETHUSA .
In heaven 's name , who is it ?


PEW .
It 's a damned villain , my pretty  and his name , to the best of my belief , is French .


ARETHUSA .
Kit ?
Kit French ?
Never !


KIT ( RISING ) .
He 's done for me .
( FALLS ON CHEST . )


[ PEW .
Do n't you take on about him , ducky  he ai n't worth it .
Cap'n Gaunt , I took him and I give him up .
You was ` ard on me this morning , Cap'n : this is my way - Pew 's way , this is - of paying of you out .


ARETHUSA .
Father , this is the blind man that came while you were abroad .
Sure you 'll not listen to HIM .
And you , Kit , you , what is this ?


KIT .
Captain Gaunt , that blind devil has half-throttled me .
He brought me here - I ca n't speak - he has almost killed me - and I 'd been drinking too .


GAUNT .
And you , David Pew , what do you say ? ]


PEW .
Cap'n , the rights of it is this .
Me and that young man there was partaking in a friendly drop of rum at the ADMIRAL BENBOW inn  and I 'd just proposed his blessed Majesty , when the young man he ups and says to me : ` Pew , ' he says , ' I like you , Pew : you 're a true seaman , ' he says  ` and I 'm one as sticks at nothing  and damme , Pew , ' he says , ` I 'll make your fortune . '
[ Can he deny as them was his words ?
Look at him , you as has eyes : no , he can not .
` Come along of me , ' he says , ` and damme , I 'll make your fortune . ' ]
Well , Cap'n , he lights a dark lantern ( which you 'll find it somewhere on the floor , I reckon ) , and out we goes , me follerin ' his lead , as I thought was ` art-of-oak and a true-blue mariner  and the next I knows is , here we was in here , and him a-askin ' me to ` old the glim , while he prised the lid off of your old sea-chest with his cutlass .


GAUNT .
The chest ?
( HE LEAPS , R. , AND EXAMINES CHEST . )
Ah !


PEW .
Leastways , I was to ` elp him , by his account of it , while he nailed the rhino , and then took and carried off that lovely maid of yours  for a lovely maid she is , and one as touched old Pew 's ` art Cap'n , when I ` eard that , my blood biled .
` Young man , ' I says , ` you do n't know David Pew , ' I says  and with that I ups and does my dooty by him , cutlass and all , like a lion - ` arted seaman , though blind .
[ And then in comes you , and I gives him up : as you know for a fack is true , and I 'll subscribe at the Assizes .
And that , if you was to cut me into junks , is the truth , the ` ole truth , and nothing but the truth , world without end , so help me , amen  and if you 'll ` and me over the ` oly Bible , me not having such a thing about me at the moment , why , I 'll put a oath upon it like a man . ]


ARETHUSA .
Father , have you heard ?


[ GAUNT .
I know this man , Arethusa , and the truth is not in him .


ARETHUSA .
Well , and why do we wait ?
We know Kit , do we not ?


KIT .
Ay , Captain , you know the pair of us , and you can see his face and mine . ]


GAUNT .
Christopher , the facts are all against you .
I find you here in my house at midnight : you who at least had eyes to see , and must have known whither you were going .
It was this man , not you , who called me up : and when I came in , it was he who was uppermost and who gave you up to justice .
This unsheathed cutlass is yours  there hangs the scabbard , empty  and as for the dark lantern , of what use is light to the blind ?
and who could have trimmed and lighted it but you ?


PEW .
Ah , Cap'n , what a ` ed for argyment !


KIT .
And now , sir , now that you have spoken , I claim the liberty to speak on my side .


GAUNT .
Not so .
I will first have done with this man .
David Pew , it were too simple to believe your story as you tell it  but I can find no testimony against you .
From whatever reason , assuredly you have done me service .
Here are five guineas to set you on your way .
Begone at once  and while it is yet time , think upon your repentance .


PEW .
Cap'n , here 's my respecks .
You 've turned a pious man , Cap'n  it does my ` art good to ` ear you .
But you ai n't the only one .
O no !
I came about and paid off on the other tack before you , I reckon : you ask the Chaplain of the Fleet else , as called me on the quarter-deck before old Admiral ` Awke himself ( TOUCHING HIS HAT ) , my old commander .
[ ` David Pew , ' he says , ` five-and-thirty year have I been in this trade , man and boy , ' that chaplain says , ` and damme , Pew , ' says he , ` if ever I seen the seaman that could rattle off his catechism within fifty mile of you .
Here 's five guineas out of my own pocket , ' he says  ` and what 's more to the pint , ' he says , ` I 'll speak to my reverend brother-in-law , the Bishop of Dover , ' he says  ` and if ever you leave the sea , and wants a place as beadle , why damme , ' says he , ` you go to him , for you 're the man for him , and him for you . '


GAUNT .
David Pew , you never set your foot on a King 's ship in all your life .
There lies the road .


PEW .
Ah , you was always a ` ard man , Cap'n , and a ` ard man to believe , like Didymus the ` Ebrew prophet .
But it 's time for me to go , and I 'll be going .
My service to you , Cap'n : and I kiss my ` and to that lovely female .


` Time for us to go , Time for us to go , A nd when we 'd clapped the hatches on , 'T was time for us to go . '
SCENE IV


KIT , ARETHUSA , GAUNT


ARETHUSA .
Now , Kit ?


KIT .
Well , sir , and now ?


GAUNT .
I find you here in my house at this untimely and unseemly hour  I find you there in company with one who , to my assured knowledge , should long since have swung in the wind at Execution Dock .
What brought you ?
Why did you open my door while I slept to such a companion ?
Christopher French , I have two treasures .
One ( LAYING HIS HAND ON ARETHUSA 'S SHOULDER ) I know you covet .
Christopher , is this your love ?


KIT .
Sir , I have been fooled and trapped .
That man declared he knew you , declared he could make you change your mind about our marriage .
I was drunk , sir , and I believed him : heaven knows I am sober now , and can see my folly  but I believed him then , and followed him .
He brought me here , he told me your chest was full of gold that would make men of us for life .
At that I saw my fault , sir , and drew my cutlass  and he , in the wink of an eye , roared out for help , leaped at my throat like a weasel and had me rolling on the floor .
He was quick , and I , as I tell you , sir , was off my balance .


GAUNT .
Is this man , Pew , your enemy ?


KIT .
No sir  I never saw him till to-night .


GAUNT .
Then , if you must stand the justice of your country , come to the proof with a better plea .
What ?
lantern and cutlass yours  you the one that knew the house  you the one that saw  you the one overtaken and denounced  and you spin me a galley yarn like that ?
If that is all your defence , you 'll hang , sir , hang .


ARETHUSA .
Ah !
Father , I give him up : I will never see him , never speak to him , never think of him again  I take him from my heart  I give myself wholly up to you and to my mother  I will obey you in every point - O , not at a word merely - at a finger raised !
I will do all this  I will do anything - anything you bid me  I swear it in the face of heaven .
Only - Kit !
I love him , father , I love him .
Let him go .


[ GAUNT .
Go ?


ARETHUSA .
You let the other .
Open the door again - for my sake , father - in my mother 's name - O , open the door and let him go . ]


KIT .
Let me go ?
My girl , if you had cast me out is morning , good and well : I would have left you , though it broke my heart .
But it 's a changed story now  now I 'm down on my luck , and you come and stab me from behind .
I ask no favour , and I 'll take none  I stand here on my innocence , and God helping me I 'll clear my good name , and get your love again , if it 's love worth having .
[ Now , Captain Gaunt , I 've said my say , and you may do your pleasure .
I am my father 's son , and I never feared to face the truth .


GAUNT .
You have spoken like a man , French , and you may go .
I leave you free .


KIT .
Nay , sir , not so : not with my will .
I 'm accused and counted guilty  the proofs are against me  the girl I love has turned upon me .
I 'll accept no mercy at your hands . ]
Captain Gaunt , I am your prisoner .


ARETHUSA .
Kit , dear Kit -


GAUNT .
Silence !
Young man , I have offered you liberty without bond or condition .
You refuse .
You shall be judged .
Meanwhile ( OPENING THE DOOR , R. ) , you will go in here .
I keep your cutlass .
The night brings counsel : to-morrow shall decide .

GAUNT , ARETHUSA , afterwards PEW


ARETHUSA .
Father , you believe in him  you do  I know you do .


GAUNT .
Child , I am not given to be hasty .
I will pray and sleep upon this matter .
( A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR , C. ) Who knocks so late ?
( HE OPENS . )


PEW ( ENTERING ) .
Cap'n , shall I fetch the constable ?


GAUNT .
No .


PEW .
No ?
Have ye killed him ?

( GAUNT RE-ENTERS , C. , AS THE DROP FALLS . )


ACT IV .


The Stage represents the Admiral 's house , as in Acts I. and III .
A chair , L. , in front .
As the curtain rises , the Stage is dark .
Enter ARETHUSA , L. , with candle  she lights another  and passes to door , R. , which she unbolts .
Stage light SCENE I


ARETHUSA , KIT


ARETHUSA .
Come , dear Kit , come !


KIT .
Well , I 'm here .


ARETHUSA .
O Kit , you are not angry with me .


KIT .
Have I reason to be pleased ?


ARETHUSA .
Kit , I was wrong .
Forgive me .


KIT .
O yes .
I forgive you .
I suppose you meant it kindly  but there are some kindnesses a man would rather die than take a gift of .
When a man is accused , Arethusa , it is not that he fears the gallows - it 's the shame that cuts him .
At such a time as that , the way to help was to stand to your belief .
You should have nailed my colours to the mast , not spoke of striking them .
If I were to be hanged to-morrow , and your love there , and a free pardon and a dukedom on the other side - which would I choose ?


ARETHUSA .
Kit , you must judge me fairly .
It was not my life that was at stake , it was yours .
Had it been mine - mine , Kit - what had you done , then ?


KIT .
I am a downright fool  I saw it inside out .
Why , give you up , by George !


ARETHUSA .
Ah , you see !
Now you understand .
It was all pure love .
When he said that word - O !
- death and that disgrace !
... But I know my father .
He fears nothing so much as the goodness of his heart  and yet it conquers .
He would pray , he said : and to-night , and by the kindness of his voice , I knew he was convinced already .
All that is wanted , is that you should forgive me .


KIT .
Arethusa , if you looked at me like that I 'd forgive you piracy on the high seas .
I was only sulky  I was boxed up there in the black dark , and could n't see my hand .
It made me pity that blind man , by George !


ARETHUSA .
O , that blind man !
The fiend !
He came back , Kit : did you hear him ?
he thought we had killed you - you !


KIT .
Well , well , it serves me right for keeping company with such a swab .


ARETHUSA .
One thing puzzles me : how did you get in ?
I saw my father lock the door .


KIT .
Ah , how ?
That 's just it .
I was a sheet in the wind , you see .
How did we ?
He did it somehow ... By George , he had a key !
He can get in again .


ARETHUSA .
Again ?
that man !


KIT .
Ay , can he !
Again !
When he likes !


ARETHUSA .
Kit , I am afraid .
O Kit , he will kill my father .


KIT .
Afraid .
I 'm glad of that .
Now , you 'll see I 'm worth my salt at something .
Ten to one he 's back to Mrs. Drake 's .
I 'll after , and lay him aboard .


ARETHUSA .
O Kit , he is too strong for you .


KIT .
Arethusa , that 's below the belt !
Never you fear  I 'll give a good account of him .


ARETHUSA ( TAKING CUTLASS FROM THE WALL ) .
You 'll be none the worse for this , dear .


KIT .
That 's so ( MAKING CUTS ) .
All the same , I 'm half ashamed to draw on a blind man  it 's too much odds .
( HE LEAPS SUDDENLY AGAINST THE TABLE . )
Ah !


ARETHUSA .
Kit !
Are you ill ?


KIT .
My head 's like a humming top  it serves me right for drinking .


ARETHUSA .
O , and the blind man !
( SHE RUNS , L. , TO THE CORNER CUPBOARD , BRINGS A BOTTLE AND GLASS , AND FILLS AND OFFERS GLASS . )
Here , lad , drink that .
KIT .
To you !
That 's better .
( BOTTLE AND GLASS REMAIN ON GAUNT 'S TABLE . )
ARETHUSA .
Suppose you miss him ?


KIT .
Miss him !
The road is straight  and I can hear the tap - tapping of that stick a mile away .


ARETHUSA ( LISTENING ) .
St !
my father stirring in his room !


KIT .
Let me get clear  tell him why when I 'm gone .
The door - ?


ARETHUSA .
Locked !


KIT .
The window !


ARETHUSA .
Quick , quick !
( SHE UNFASTENS R. WINDOW , BY WHICH KIT GOES OUT . )
SCENE II


ARETHUSA , GAUNT ENTERING L .


ARETHUSA .
Father , Kit is gone ... He is asleep .


AUNT .
Waiting , waiting and wearying .
The years , they go so heavily , my Hester still waiting !
( HE GOES R. TO CHEST , WHICH HE OPENS . )
That is your chain  it 's of Guinea gold  I brought it you from Guinea .
( TAKING OUT CHAIN . )
You liked it once  it pleased you long ago  O , why not now - why will you not be happy now ?
... I swear this is my last voyage  see , I lay my hand upon the Holy Book and swear it .
One more venture - for the child 's sake , Hester  you do n't think upon your little maid .


ARETHUSA .
Ah , for my sake , it was for my sake !


GAUNT .
Ten days out from Lagos .
That 's a strange sunset , Mr. Yeo .
All hands shorten sail !
Lay aloft there , look smart ! . . .
What 's that ?
Only the negroes in the hold ... . .
Mr. Yeo , she ca n't live long at this  I have a wife and child in Barnstaple ... Christ , what a sea !
Hold on , for God 's sake - hold on fore and aft !
Great God !
( AS THOUGHT THE SEA WERE MAKING A BREACH OVER THE SHIP AT THE MOMENT ) .
ARETHUSA .
O !


GAUNT .
They seem quieter down below there ... No water - no light - no air - seven days battened down , and the seas mountain high , and the ship labouring hell-deep !
Two hundred and five , two hundred and five , two hundred and five - all to eternal torture !


ARETHUSA .
O pity him , pity him !
Let him sleep , let him forget !
Let her prayers avail in heaven , and let him rest !
GAUNT .
Hester , no , do n't smile at me .
Rather tears !
I have seen you weep - often , often  two hundred and five times .
Two hundred and five !
( WITH RING .
Hester , here is your ring ( HE TRIES TO PUT THE RING ON HIS FINGER ) .
How comes it in my hand ?
Not fallen off again ?
O no , impossible !
it was made smaller , dear , it ca n't have fallen off !
Ah , you waste away .
You must live , you must , for the dear child 's sake , for mine , Hester , for mine !
Ah , the child .
Yes .
Who am I to judge ?
Poor Kit French !
And she , your little maid , she 's like you , Hester , and she will save him !
How should a man be saved without a wife ?


ARETHUSA .
O father , if you could but hear me thank and bless you !
( THE TAPPING OF PEW 'S STICK IS HEARD APPROACHING .
GAUNT PASSES L. FRONT AND SITS . )


GAUNT ( BEGINNING TO COUNT THE TAPS ) .
One - two - two hundred and five


ARETHUSA ( LISTENING ) .
God help me , the blind man !
( SHE RUNS TO DOOR , C.  THE KEY IS PUT INTO THE LOCK FROM WITHOUT , AND THE DOOR OPENS . )
SCENE III


ARETHUSA ( AT BACK OF STAGE BY THE DOOR )  GAUNT ( FRONT L. )  TO THESE , PEW , C .


PEW ( SOTTO VOCE ) .
All snug .
( COMING DOWN . )
So that was you , my young friend Christopher , as shot by me on the road  and so you was hot foot after old Pew ?
Christopher , my young friend , I reckon I 'll have the bowels out of that chest , and I reckon you 'll be lagged and scragged for it .
( AT THESE WORDS ARETHUSA LOCKS THE DOOR , AND TAKES THE KEY . )
What 's that ?
All still .
There 's something wrong about this room .
Pew , my ` art of oak , you 're queer to-night  brace up , and carry off .
Where 's the tool ?
( PRODUCING KNIFE . )
Ah , here she is  and now for the chest  and the gold  and rum - rum - rum .
What !
Open ?
... old clothes , by God !
... He 's done me  he 's been before me  he 's bolted with the swag  that 's why he ran : Lord wither and waste him forty year for it !
O Christopher , if I had my fingers on your throat !
Why did n't I strangle the soul out of him ?
I heard the breath squeak in his weasand  and Jack Gaunt pulled me off .
Ah , Jack , that 's another I owe you .
My pious friend , if I was God Almighty for five minutes !
( GAUNT RISES AND BEGINS TO PACE THE STAGE LIKE A QUARTERDECK , L. ) What 's that ?
A man 's walk .
He do n't see me , thank the blessed dark !
But it 's time to slip , my bo .
( HE GROPES HIS WAY STEALTHILY TILL HE COMES TO GAUNT 'S TABLE , WHERE HE BURNS HIS HAND IN THE CANDLE . )
A candle - lighted - then it 's bright as day !
Lord God , does n't he see me ?
It 's the horrors come alive .
( GAUNT DRAWS NEAR AND TURNS AWAY . )
I 'll go mad , mad !
( HE GROPES TO THE DOOR , STOPPING AND STARTING . )
Door .
( HIS VOICE RISING FOR THE FIRST TIME , SHARP WITH TERROR . )
Locked ?
Key gone ?
Trapped !
Keep off - keep off of me - keep away !
( SOTTO VOCE AGAIN . )
Keep your head , Lord have mercy , keep your head .
I 'm wet with sweat .
What devil 's den is this ?
I must out - out !
( HE SHAKES THE DOOR VEHEMENTLY . )
No ?
Knife it is then - knife - knife - knife !
( HE MOVES WITH THE KNIFE RAISED TOWARDS GAUNT , INTENTLY LISTENING , AND CHANGING HIS DIRECTION AS GAUNT CHANGES HIS POSITION ON THE STAGE . )


ARETHUSA ( RUSHING TO INTERCEPT HIM ) .
Father , father , wake !


GAUNT .
Hester , Hester !
( HE TURNS , IN TIME TO SEE ARETHUSA GRAPPLE PEW IN THE CENTRE OF THE STAGE , AND PEW FORCE HER DOWN . )
ARETHUSA .
Kit !
Kit !


PEW ( WITH THE KNIFE RAISED ) .
Pew 's way !


SCENE IV


TO THESE , KIT


( He leaps through window , R. , and cuts PEW down .
At the same moment , GAUNT , who has been staring helplessly at his daughter 's peril , fully awakes . )


GAUNT .
Death and blood !
( KIT , HELPING ARETHUSA , HAS LET FALL THE CUTLASS .
GAUNT PICKS IT UP AND RUNS ON PEW . )
Damned mutineer , I 'll have your heart out !
( HE STOPS , STANDS STARING , DROPS CUTLASS , FALLS UPON HIS KNEES . )
God forgive me !
Ah , foul sins , would you blaze forth again ?
Lord , close your ears !
Hester , Hester , hear me not !
Shall all these years and tears be unavailing ?


ARETHUSA .
Father , I am not hurt .


GAUNT .
Ay , daughter , but my soul - my lost soul !


PEW ( RISING ON HIS ELBOW ) .
Rum ?
You 've done me .
For God 's sake , rum .
( ARETHUSA POURS OUT A GLASS , WHICH KIT GIVES TO HIM . )
Rum ?
This ai n't rum  it 's fire !
( WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT . )
What 's this ?
I do n't like rum ?
( FEEBLY . )
Ay , then , I 'm a dead man , and give me water .


GAUNT .
Now even his sins desert him .


PEW ( DRINKING WATER ) .
Jack Gaunt , you 've always been my rock ahead .
It 's thanks to you I 've got my papers , and this time I 'm shipped for Fiddler 's Green .
Admiral , we ai n't like to meet again , and I 'll give you a toast : Here 's Fiddler 's Green , and damn all lubbers !
( SEIZING GAUNT 'S ARM . )
I say - fair dealings , Jack !
- none of that heaven business : Fiddler 's Green 's my port , now , ai n't it ?


GAUNT .
David , you 've hove short up , and God forbid that I deceive you .
Pray , man , pray  for in the place to which you are bound there is no mercy and no hope .


PEW .
Ay , my lass , you 're black , but your blood 's red , and I 'm all a-muck with it .
Pass the rum , and be damned to you .
( TRYING TO SING ) -


` Time for us to go , Time for us - ' ( HE DIES . )


GAUNT .
But for the grace of God , there lies John Gaunt !
Christopher , you have saved my child  and I , I , that was blinded with self-righteousness , have fallen .
Take her , Christopher  but O , walk humbly !
