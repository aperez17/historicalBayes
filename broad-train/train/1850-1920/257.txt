THE FULL MOON


Scene : A shed close to Cloon Station  Bartley Fallon is sitting gloomily on a box  Hyacinth Halvey and Shawn Early are coming in at door .


Shawn Early : It is likely the train will not be up to its time , and cattle being on it for the fair .
It 's best wait in the shed .
Is that Bartley Fallon ?
What way are you , Bartley ?


Bartley Fallon : Faith , no way at all .
On the drag , on the drag  striving to put the bad times over me .


Shawn Early : Is it business with the nine o'clock you have ?


Bartley Fallon : The wife that is gone visiting to Tubber , and that has the door locked till such time as she will come back on the train .
And I thought this shed a place where no bad thing would be apt to happen me , and not to be going through the streets , and the darkness falling .


Shawn Early : It is not long till the full moon will be rising .


Bartley Fallon : Everything that is bad , the falling sickness - God save the mark - or the like , should be at its worst at the full moon .
I suppose because it is the leader of the stars .


Shawn Early : Ah , what could happen any person in the street of Cloon ?


Bartley Fallon : There might .
Look at Matt Finn , the coffin-maker , put his hand on a cage the circus brought , and the lion took and tore it till they stuck him with a fork you 'd rise dung with , and at that he let it drop .
And that was a man had never quitted Cloon .


Shawn Early : I thought you might be sending something to the fair .


Bartley Fallon : It is n't to the train I would be trusting anything I would have to sell , where it might be thrown off the track .
And where would be the use sending the couple of little lambs I have ?
It is likely there is no one would ask me where was I going .
When the weight is not in them , they wo n't carry the price .
Sure , the grass I have is no good , but seven times worse than the road .


Shawn Early : They are saying there 'll be good demand at the fair of Carrow to-morrow .


Hyacinth Halvey : To-morrow the fair day of Carrow ?
I was not remembering that .


Bartley Fallon : Ah , there wo n't be many in it , I 'm thinking .
There is n't a hungrier village in Connacht , they were telling me , and it 's poor the look of it as well .


Hyacinth Halvey : To-morrow the fair day .
There will be all sorts in the streets to-night .


Bartley Fallon : The sort that will be in it will be a bad sort - sievemakers and tramps and neuks .


Hyacinth Halvey : The tents on the fair green  there will be music in it  there was a fiddler having no legs would set men of threescore years and of fourscore years dancing .
I can nearly hear his tune .


( He whistles `` The Heather Broom . '' )


Bartley Fallon : You are apt to be going there on the train , I suppose ?
It is well to be you , Mr. Halvey , having a good place in the town , and the price of your fare , and maybe six times the price of it , in your pocket .


Hyacinth Halvey : I did n't think of that .
I wonder could I go - for one night only - and see what the lads are doing .


Shawn Early : Are you forgetting , Mr. Halvey , that you are to meet his Reverence on the platform that is coming home from drinking water at the Spa ?


Hyacinth Halvey : So I can meet him , and get in the train after him getting out .


( Mrs. Broderick and Peter Tannian come in . )


Mrs. Broderick : Is that Mr. Halvey is in it ?
I was looking for you at the chapel as I passed , and the Angelus bell after ringing .


Hyacinth Halvey : Business I have here , ma'am .
I was in dread I might not be here before the train .


Mrs. Broderick : So you might not , indeed .
That nine o'clock train you can never trust it to be late .


Hyacinth Halvey : To meet Father Gregan I am come , and maybe to go on myself .


Mrs. Broderick : Sure , I knew well you would be in haste to be before Father Gregan , and we knowing what we know .


Hyacinth Halvey : I have no business only to be showing respect to him .


Shawn Early : His good word he will give to Mr. Halvey at the Board , where it is likely he will be made Clerk of the Union next week .


Mrs. Broderick : His good word he will give to another thing besides that , I am thinking .


Hyacinth Halvey : I do n't know what you are talking about .


Mrs. Broderick : Did n't you hear the news , Peter Tannian , that Mr. Halvey is apt to be linked and joined in marriage with Miss Joyce , the priest 's housekeeper ?


Peter Tannian : I to believe all the lies I 'd hear , I 'd be a racked man by this .


Mrs. Broderick : What I say now is as true as if you were on the other side of me .
I suppose now the priest is come home there 'll be no delay getting the license .


Hyacinth Halvey : It is not so settled as that .


Mrs. Broderick : Why would n't it be settled and it being told at Mrs. Delane 's and through the whole world ?


Peter Tannian : She should be a steady wife for him - a fortied girl .


Shawn Early : A very good fortune in the bank they are saying she has , and she having crossed the ocean twice to America .


Hartley Fallen : It 's as good for him to have a woman will keep the door open before him and his victuals ready and a quiet tongue in her head .
Not like that little Tartar of my own .


Mrs. Broderick .
And an educated woman along with that .
A man of his sort , going to be Clerk of the Union and to be taken up with books and papers , it 's likely he 'd die in a week , he to marry a dunce .


Bartley Fallon : So it 's likely he would .


Mrs. Broderick : A little shop they are saying she will take , for to open a flour store , and you to be keeping the accounts , the way you would not spend any waste time .


Hyacinth Halvey : I have no mind to be settling myself down yet a while .
I might maybe take a ramble here or there .
There 's many of my comrades in the States .


Mrs. Broderick : To go away from Cloon , is it ?
And why would you think to do that , and the whole town the same as a father and mother to you ?
Sure , the sergeant would live and die with you , and there are no two from this to Galway as great as yourself and the priest .
To see you coming up the street , and your Dublin top-coat around you , there are some would give you a salute the same nearly as the Bishop .


Peter Tannian : They would n't do that maybe and they hearing things as I heard them .


Hyacinth Halvey : What things ?


Peter Tannian : There was a herd passing through from Carrow .
It is what I heard him saying - - -


Mrs. Broderick : You heard nothing of Mr. Halvey , but what is worthy of him .
But that 's the way always .
The most thing a man does , the less he will get for it after .


Peter Tannian : A grand place in Carrow I suppose you had ?


Hyacinth Halvey : I had plenty of places .
Giving out proclamations - attending waterworks - - .


Mrs. Broderick : It is well fitted for any place he is , and all that was written around him and he coming into Cloon .


Peter Tannian : Writing is easy .


Mrs. Broderick : Look at him since he was here , this twelvemonth back , that he never went into a dance-house or stood at a cross-road , and never lost a half-an-hour with drink .
Made no blunder , made no rumours .
Whatever could be said of his worth , it could not be too well said .


Hyacinth Halvey : Do you think now , ma'am , would it be any harm I to go spend a day or maybe two days out of this - I to go on the train - - .


Miss Joyce : ( At door , coming in backwards . )
Go back now , go back !
Do n't be following after me in through the door !
Is Mr. Halvey there ?
Do n't let her come following me , Mr. Halvey !


Hyacinth Halvey : Who is it is in it ?


( Sound of discordant singing outside . )


Miss Joyce : Cracked Mary it is , that is after coming back this day from the asylum .


Hyacinth Halvey : I never saw her , I think .


Shawn Early : The creature , she was light this long while and not good in the head , and at the last lunacy came on her and she was tied and bound .
Sometimes singing and dancing she does be , and sometimes troublesome .


Miss Joyce : They had a right to keep her spancelled in the asylum .
She would begrudge any respectable person to be walking the street .
She 'd hoot you , she 'd shout you , she 'd clap her hands at you .
She is a blight in the town .


Hyacinth Halvey : There is a lad along with her .


Shawn Early : It is Davideen , her brother , that is innocent .
He was left rambling from place to place the time she was put within walls .


( Cracked Mary and Davideen come in .
Miss Joyce clings to Hyacinth 's arm . )


Cracked Mary : Give me a charity now , the way I 'll be keeping a little rag on me and a little shoe to my foot .
Give me the price of tobacco and the price of a grain of tea  for tobacco is blessed and tea is good for the head .


Shawn Early : Give out now , Davideen , a verse of `` The Heather Broom . ''
That 's a splendid tune .


Davideen : ( Sings . )


Oh , do n't you remember , As it 's often I told you , As you passed through our kitchen , That a new broom sweeps clean ?
Come out now and buy one , Come out now and try one - ( His voice cracks , and he breaks off , laughing foolishly . )


Mrs. Broderick : He has a sweet note in his voice , but to know or to understand what he is doing , he could n't do it .


Cracked Mary : Leave him a while .
His song that does be clogged through the daytime , the same as the sight is clogged with myself .
It is n't but in the night time I can see anything worth while .
Davy is a proper boy , a proper boy  let you leave Davy alone .
It was himself came before me ere yesterday in the morning , and I walking out the madhouse door .


Shawn Early : It is often there will fiddlers be waiting to play for them coming out , that are maybe the finest dancers of the day .


Cracked Mary : Waiting before me he was , and no one to give him knowledge unless it might be the Big Man .
I give you my word he near ate the face off me .
As glad to see me he was as if I had dropped from heaven .
Come hither to me , Davy , and give no heed to them .
It is as dull and as lagging as themselves you would be maybe , and the world to be different and the moon to change its courses with the sun .


Bartley Fallon : I never would wish to be put within a madhouse before I 'd die .


Cracked Mary : Sorry they were losing me .
There was not a better prisoner in it than my own four bones .


Bartley Fallon : Squeals you would hear from it , they were telling me , like you 'd hear at the ringing of the pigs .
Savages with whips beating them the same as hounds .
You would not stand and listen to them for a hundred sovereigns .
Of all bad things that can come upon a man , it is certain the madness is the last .


Miss Joyce : It is likely she was well content in it , and the friends she had being of her own class .


Cracked Mary : What way could you make friends with people would be always talking ?
Too much of talk and of noise there was in it , cursing , and praying , and tormenting  some dancing , some singing , and one writing a letter to a she devil called Lucifer .
I not to close my ears , I would have lost the sound of Davideen 's song .


Miss Joyce : It was good shelter you got in it through the bad weather , and not to be out perishing under cold , the same as the starlings in the snow .


Cracked Mary : I was my seven months in it , my seven months and a day .
My good clothes that went astray on me and my boots .
My fine gaudy dress was all moth-eated , that was worked with the wings of birds .
To fall into dust and ashes it did , and the wings rose up into the high air .


Bartley Fallen .
Take care would the madness catch on to ourselves the same as the chin-cough or the pock .


Mrs. Broderick : Ah , that 's not the way it goes travelling from one to another , but some that are naturally cracked and inherit it .


Shawn Early : It is a family failing with her tribe .
The most of them get giddy in their latter end .


Miss Joyce : It might be it was sent as a punishment before birth , for to show the power of God .


Peter Tannian : It is tea-drinking does it , and that is the reason it is on the wife it is apt to fall for the most part .


Mrs. Broderick : Ah , there 's some does be thinking their wives is n't right , and there 's others think they are too right .
There to be any fear of me going astray , I give you my word I 'd lose my wits on the moment .


Hyacinth Halvey : There are some say it is the moon .


Shawn Early : So it is too .
The time the moon is going back , the blood that is in a person does be weakening , but when the moon is strong , the blood that moves strong in the same way .
And it to be at the full , it drags the wits along with it , the same as it drags the tide .


Mrs. Broderick : Those that are light show off more and have the talk of twenty the time it is at the full , that is sure enough .
And to hold up a silk handkerchief and to look through it , you would see the four quarters of the moon  I was often told that .


Miss Joyce : It is not you , Mr. Halvey , will give in to an unruly thing like the moon , that is under no authority , and can not be put back , the same as a fast day that would chance to fall upon a feast .


Hyacinth Halvey : It is likely it is put in the sky the same as a clock for our use , the way you would pick knowledge of the weather , the time the stars would be wild about it .


Mrs. Broderick : That is very nice now .
The thing you 'd know , you 'd like to go on , and to hear more or less about it .


Miss Joyce : ( To H.H. ) It is a lantern for your own use it will be to-night , and his Reverence coming home through the street , and yourself coming along with him to the house .


Mrs. Broderick : That 's right , Miss Joyce .
Keep a good grip of him .
What do you say to him talking a while ago as if his mind was running on some thought to leave Cloon ?


Miss Joyce : What way could he leave it ?


Hyacinth Halvey : No way at all , I 'm thinking , unless there would be a miracle worked by the moon .


Mrs. Broderick : Ah , miracles is gone out of the world this long time , with education , unless that they might happen in your own inside .


Miss Joyce : I 'll go set the table and kindle the fire , and I 'll come back to meet the train with you myself .


( She goes .
A noise heard outside . )


Hyacinth Halvey : What is that now ?


Shawn Early : ( At door . )
Some noise as of running .


Hartley Fallon : ( Going to door . )
It might chance to be some prisoner they would be bringing to the train .


Peter Tannian : No , but some lads that are running .


( They go out .
H.H. is going too , but Mrs. Broderick goes before him and turns him round in doorway . )


Mrs. Broderick : Do n't be coming out now in the dust that was formed by the heat is in the breeze .
It would be a pity to spoil your Dublin coat , or your shirt that is that white you would nearly take it to be blue .


( She goes out , pushing him in and shutting door after her . )


Cracked Mary : Ha !
ha !
ha !


Hyacinth Halvey : What is it you are laughing at ?


Cracked Mary : Ha !
ha !
ha !
It is a very laughable thing now , the third most laughable thing I ever met with in my lifetime .


Hyacinth Halvey : What is that ?


Cracked Mary : A fine young man to be shut up and bound in a narrow little shed , and the full moon rising , and I knowing what I know !


Hyacinth Halvey : It 's little you are likely to know about me .


Cracked Mary : Tambourines and fiddles and pipes - melodeons and the whistling of drums .


Hyacinth Halvey : I suppose it is the Carrow fair you are talking about .


Cracked Mary : Sitting within walls , and a top-coat wrapped around him , and mirth and music and frolic being in the place we know , and some dancing sets on the floor .


Hyacinth Halvey : I wish I was n't in this place tonight .
I would like well to be going on the train , if it was n't for the talk the neighbours would be making .
I would like well to slip away .
It is a long time I am going without any sort of funny comrades .


( Goes to door .
The others enter quickly , pushing him back . )


Bartley Fallon : Nothing at all to see .
It would be best for us to have stopped where we were .


Mrs. Broderick : Running like foals to see it , and nothing to be in it worth while .


Hyacinth Halvey : What was it was in it ?


Shawn Early : Nothing at all but some lads that were running in pursuit of a dog .


Bartley Fallon : Near knocked us they did , and they coming round the corner of the wall .


Hyacinth Halvey : Is it that it was a mad dog ?


Peter Tannian : Ah , what mad ?
Mad dogs are done away with now by the head Government and muzzles and the police .


Bartley Fallon : They are more watchful over them than they used .
But all the same , you to see a strange dog afar off , you would be uneasy , thinking it might be yourself he would be searching out as his prey .


Mrs. Broderick : Sure , there did a dog go mad through Galway , and the whole town rose against him , and flocked him into a corner , and shot him there .
He did no harm after , he being made an end of at the first .


Shawn Early : It might be that dog they were pursuing after was mad , on the head of being under the full moon .


Cracked Mary : ( Jumping up excitedly . )
That mad dog , he is a Dublin dog  he is betune you and Belfast - he is running ahead - you could n't keep up with him .


Hyacinth Halvey : There is one , so , mad upon the road .


Cracked Mary : There is police after him , but they can not come up with him  he destroyed a splendid sow  nine bonavs they buried or less .


Shawn Early : What place is he gone now ?


Cracked Mary : He made off towards Craughwell , and he bit a fine young man .


Bartley Fallen : So he would too .
Sure , when a mad dog would be going about , on horseback or wherever you are , you 're ruined .


Cracked Mary : That dog is going on all the time  he would n't stop , but go ahead and bring that mouthful with him .
He is still on the road  he is keeping the middle of the road  they say he is as big as a calf .


Hyacinth Halvey : It is the police I have a right to forewarn to go after him .


Cracked Mary : The motor cars is going to get out to track him , for fear he would destroy the world !


Mrs. Broderick : That is a very nice thought now , to be sending the motor cars after him to overturn and to crush him the same as an ass-car in their path .


Cracked Mary : You ca n't save yourself from a dog  he is after his own equals , dogs .
He is doing every harm .
They are out night and day .


Shawn Early : Sure , a mad dog would go from this to Kinvara in a half a minute , like the train .


Cracked Mary : He wo n't stay in this country down - he goes the straight road - he takes by the wind .
He is as big as a yearling calf .


Mrs. Broderick : I would n't ever forgive myself I to see him .


Cracked Mary : He is not very heavy yet .
There is only the relics in him .


Hyacinth Halvey : They have a right to bring their rifles in their hand .


Cracked Mary : The police is afraid of their life .
They wrote for motor cars to follow him .
Sure , he 'd destroy the beasts of the field .
A milch cow , he to grab at her , she 's settled .
Terrible wicked he is  he 's as big as five dogs , and he does be very strong .
I hope in the Lord he 'll be caught .
It will be a blessing from the Almighty God to kill that dog .


Hyacinth Halvey : He is surely the one is raging through the street .


Peter Tannian : Why would n't he be him ?
Is it likely there would be two of them in it at the one time ?


Shawn Early : A queer cut of a dog he was  a lurcher , a bastard hound .


Peter Tannian : I would say him to be about the size of the foal of a horse .


Mrs. Broderick : Did n't he behave well not to do ourselves an injury ?


Bartley Fallon : It is likely he will do great destruction .
I would n't say but I felt the weight of him and his two paws around my neck .


Hyacinth Halvey : I will go out following him .


Shawn Early : ( Holding him ) .
Oh , let you not endanger yourself !
It is the peelers should go follow him , that are armed with their batons and their guns .


Hyacinth Halvey : I 'll go .
He might do some injury going through the town .


Mrs. Broderick : Ah now , it is not yourself we would let go into danger !
It is Peter Tannian should go , if any person should go .


Peter Tannian : Is it Hyacinth Halvey you are taking to be so far before myself ?


Mrs. Broderick : Why would n't he be before you ?


Peter Tannian : Ask him what was he in Carrow ?
Ask was he a sort of a corner-boy , ringing the bell , pumping water , gathering a few coppers in the daytime for to scatter on a game of cards .


Hyacinth Halvey : Stop your lies and your chat !


Mrs. Broderick : ( to Tannian ) You are going light in the head to talk that way .


Shawn Early : He is , and queer in the mind .
Take care did he get a bite from the dog , that left some venom working in his blood .


Hyacinth Halvey : So he might , and he having a sort of a little rent in his sleeve .


Peter Tannian : I to have got a bite from the dog , is it ?
I did not come anear him at all .
You to strip me as bare as winter you will not find the track of his teeth .
It is Shawn Early was nearer to him than what I was .


Shawn Early : I was not nearer , or as near as what Mrs. Broderick was .


Mrs. Broderick : I made away when I saw him .
My chest is not the better of it yet .
Since I left off fretting I got gross .
I am that nervous I would run from a blessed sheep , let alone a dog .


Shawn Early : To see any of the signs of madness upon him , it is Mr. Halvey the sergeant would look to for to make his report .


Hyacinth Halvey : So I would make a report .


Peter Tannian : Is it that you lay down you can see signs ?
Is that the learning they were giving you in Carrow ?


Mrs. Broderick : Do n't be speaking with him at all .
It is easy know the signs .
A person to be laughing and mocking , and that would not have the same habits with yourself , or to have no fear of things you would be in dread of , or to be using a different class of food .


Peter Tannian : I use no food but clean food .


Hyacinth Halvey : To be giddy in the head is a sign , and to be talking of things that passed years ago .


Peter Tannian : I am talking of nothing but the thing I have a right to talk of .


Mrs. Broderick : To be nervous and thinking and pausing , and playing with knicknacks .


Peter Tannian : It never was my habit to be playing with knicknacks .


Bartley Fallon : When the master in the school where I was went queer , he beat me with two clean rods , and wrote my name with my own blood .


Mrs. Broderick : To take the shoe off their foot , and to hit out right and left with it , bawling their life out , tearing their clothes , scattering and casting them in every part  or to run naked through the town , and all the people after them .


Shawn Early : To be jumping the height of trees they do be , and all the people striving to slacken them .


Hyacinth Halvey : To steal prayer-books and rosaries , and to be saying prayers they never could keep in mind before .


Mrs. Broderick : Very strong , that they could leap a wall - jumping and pushing and kicking - or to tie people to one another with a rope .


Shawn Early : Any fear of any person here being violent , Mr. Halvey will get him put under restraint .


Peter Tannian : Is it myself you are thinking to put under restraint ?
Would a man would be pushing and kicking and tearing his clothes , be able to do arithmetic on a board ?
Look now at that .
( Chalks figures on door . )
Three and three makes six !
- and three -


Mrs. Broderick : I 'm no hand at figuring , but I can say out a blessed hymn , what any person with the mind gone contrary in them could not do .
Hearken now till you 'll know is there confusion in my mind .
( Sings . )


Mary Broderick is my name  Fiddane was my station  Cloon is my dwelling-place  And ( I hope ) heaven is my destination .
Mary Broderick is my name , Cloon was my - Cracked Mary : ( With a cackle of delight . )
Give heed to them now , Davideen !
That 's the way the crazed people used to be going on in the place where I was , every one thinking the other to be cracked .


Hyacinth Halvey : ( To Tannian . )
Look now at your great figuring !
Argus with his hundred eyes would n't know is that a nought or is it a nine without a tail .


Peter Tannian : Leave that blame on a little ridge that is in the nature of the chalk .
Look now at Mary Broderick , that it has failed to word out her verse .


Mrs. Broderick : Ah , what signifies ?
I 'd never get light greatly .
It would n't be worth while I to go mad .


( Bartley Fallon gives a deep groan . )


Shawn Early : What is on you , Bartley ?


Bartley Fallon : I 'm in dread it is I myself has got the venom into my blood .


Hyacinth Halvey : What makes you think that ?


Bartley Fallon : It 's a sort of a thing would be apt to happen me , and any malice to fall within the town at all .


Mrs. Broderick : Give heed to him , Hyacinth Halvey  you are the most man we have to baffle any wrong thing coming in our midst !


Hyacinth Halvey : Is it that you are feeling any pain as of a wound or a sore ?


Bartley Fallon : Some sort of a little catch I 'm thinking there is in under my knee .
I would feel no pain unless I would turn it contrary .


Hyacinth Halvey : What class of feeling would you say you are feeling ?


Bartley Fallon : I am feeling as if the five fingers of my hand to be lessening from me , the same as five farthing dips the heat of the sun would be sweating the tallow from .


Hyacinth Halvey : That is a strange account .


Bartley Fallon : And a sort of a megrim in my head , the same as a sheep would get a fit of staggers in a field .


Hyacinth Halvey : That is what I would look for .
Is there some sort of a roaring in your ear ?


Bartley Fallon : There is , there is , as if I would hear voices would be talking .


Hyacinth Halvey : Would you feel any wish to go tearing and destroying ?


Bartley Fallon : I would indeed , and there to be an enemy upon my path .
Would you say now , Widow Broderick , am I getting anyway flushy in the face ?


Mrs. Broderick : Do n't leave your eye off him for pity 's sake .
He is reddening as red as a rose .


Bartley Fallon : I could as if walk on the wind with lightness .
Something that is rising in my veins the same as froth would be rising on a pint .


Hyacinth Halvey : It is the doctor I 'd best call for - and maybe the sergeant and the priest .


Bartley Fallon : There are three thoughts going through my mind - to hang myself or to drown myself , or to cut my neck with a reaping-hook .


Mrs. Broderick : It is the doctor will serve him best , where it is the mad blood that should be bled away .
To break up eggs , the white of them , in a tin can , will put new blood in him , and whiskey , and to taste no food through twenty-one days .


Bartley Fallon : I 'm thinking so long a fast would n't serve me .
I would n't wish the lads will bear my body to the grave , to lay down there was nothing within it but a grasshopper or a wisp of dry grass .


Shawn Early : No , but to cut a piece out of his leg the doctor will , the way the poison will get no leave to work .


Peter Tannian : Or to burn it with red-hot irons , the way it will not scatter itself and grow .
There does a doctor do that out in foreign .


Mrs. Broderick : It would be more natural to cut the leg off him in some sort of a Christian way .


Shawn Early : If it was a pig was bit , or a sow or a bonav , it to show the signs , it would be shot , if it was a whole fleet of them was in it .


Mrs. Broderick : I knew of a man that was butler in a big house was bit , and they tied him first and smothered him after , and his master shot the dog .
A splendid shot he was  the thing he 'd not see he 'd hit it the same as the thing he 'd see .
I heard that from an outside neighbour of my own , a woman that told no lies .


Shawn Early : Sure , they did the same thing to a high-up lady over in England , and she after being bit by her own little spaniel and it having a ring around its neck .


Peter Tannian : That is the only best thing to do .
Whether the bite is from a dog , or a cat , or whatever it may be , to put the quilt and the blankets on the person and smother him in the bed .
To smother them out-and-out you should , before the madness will work .


Hyacinth Halvey : I 'd be loth he to be shot or smothered .
I 'd sooner to give him a chance in the asylum .


Mrs. Broderick : To keep him there and to try him through three changes of the moon .
It 's well for you , Bartley , Mr. Halvey being in charge of you , that is known to be a tender man .


Peter Tannian : He to have got a bite and to go biting others , he would put in them the same malice .
It is the old people used to tell that down , and they must have had some reason doing that .


Shawn Early : To get a bite of a dog you must chance your life .
There is no doubt at all about that .
It might work till the time of the new moon or the full moon , and then they must be shot or smothered .


Hyacinth Halvey : It is a pity there to be no cure found for it in the world .


Shawn Early : There never came out from the Almighty any cure for a mad dog .


( Bartley Fallon has been edging towards door . )


Shawn Early : Oh !
stop him and keep a hold of him , Mr. Halvey !


Hyacinth Halvey : Stop where you are .


Bartley Fallon : Is n't it enough to have madness before me , that you will not let me go fall in my own choice place ?


Hyacinth Halvey : The neighbours would think it bad of me to let a raving man out into their midst .


Bartley Fallon : Is it to shoot me you are going ?


Hyacinth Halvey : I will call to the doctor to say is the padded room at the workhouse the most place where you will be safe , till such time as it will be known did the poison wear away .


Bartley Fallon : I will not go in it !
It is likely I might be forgot in it , or the nurses to be in dread to bring me nourishment , and they to hear me barking within the door .
I 'm thinking it was allotted by nature I never would die an easy death .


Hyacinth Halvey : I will keep a watch over you myself .


Bartley Fallon : Where 's the use of that the time the breath will be gone out of me , and you maybe playing cards on my coffin , and I having nothing around or about me but the shroud , and the habit , and the little board ?


Hyacinth Halvey : Sure , I can not leave you the way you are .


Bartley Fallon : It is what I ever and always heard , a dog to bite you , all you have to do is to take a pinch of its hair and to lay it into the wound .


Mrs. Broderick : So I heard that myself .
A dog to bite any person he is entitled to be plucked of his hair .


Hyacinth Halvey : I 'll go out  I might chance to see him .


Mrs. Broderick : You will not , without getting advice from the priest that is coming in the train .
Let his Reverence come into this place , and say is it Bartley or is it Peter Tannian was done destruction on by the dog .


Shawn Early : There is a surer way than that .


Mrs. Broderick : What way ?


Shawn Early : It takes madness to find out madness .
Let you call to the cracked woman that should know .


Hyacinth Halvey : Come hither , Mary , and tell us is there any one of your own sort in this shed ?


Mrs. Broderick : That is a good thought .
It is only themselves that recognise one another .


Bartley Fallon : Do not ask her !
I will not leave it to her !


Mrs. Broderick : Sure , she can not say more than what yourself has said against yourself .


Bartley Fallon : I 'm in dread she might know too much , and be telling out what is within in my mind .


Hyacinth Halvey : That 's foolishness .
These are not the ancient times , when Ireland was full of haunted people .


Bartley Fallon : Is a man having a wife and three acres of land to be put under the judgment of a witch ?


Hyacinth Halvey : I would not give in to any pagan thing , but to recognise one of her own sort , that is a thing can be understood .


Mrs. Broderick : So it could be too , the same as witnesses in a court .


Bartley Fallon : I will not give in to going to demons or druids or freemasons !
Was n't there enough of misfortune set before my path through every day of my lifetime without it to be linked with me after my death ?
Is it that you would force me to lose the comforts of heaven and to get the poverty of hell ?
I tell you I will have no trade with witches !
I would sooner go face the featherbeds .


Hyacinth Halvey : Say out , girl , do you see any craziness here or anything of the sort ?


Cracked Mary : Every day in the year there comes some malice into the world , and where it comes from is no good place .


Mrs. Broderick : That is it , a venomous dew , as in the year of the famine .
There is no astronomer can say it is from the earth or the sky .


Hyacinth Halvey : It is what we are asking you , did any of that malice get its scope in this place ?


Cracked Mary : That was settled in Mayo two thousand years ago .


Mrs. Broderick : Ah , there 's no head or tail to that one 's story .
You 'd be left at the latter end the same as at the commencement .


Hyacinth Halvey : That dog you were talking of , that is raging through the district and the town - did it leave any madness after it ?


Cracked Mary : It will go in the wind , there is a certain time for that .
It might go off in the wind again .
It might go shaping off and do no harm .


Bartley Fallon : Where is that dog presently , till some person might go pluck out a few ribs of its hair ?


Cracked Mary : Raging ever and always it is , raging wild .
Sure , that is a dog was in it before the foundations of the world .


Peter Tannian : Who is it now that venom fell on , whatever beast 's jaws may have scattered it ?


Cracked Mary : It is the full moon knows that .
The moon to slacken it is safe , there is no harm in it .
Almighty God will do that much .
He 'll slacken it like you 'd slacken lime .


Shawn Early : There is reason in what she is saying .
Set open the door and let the full moon call its own !


Bartley Fallon : Do n't let in the rays of it upon us or I 'm a gone man .
It to shine on them that are going wrong in the head , it would raise a great stir in the mind .
Sure , it 's in the asylum at that time they do have whips to chastise them .


( Goes to corner . )


Cracked Mary : That 's it .
The moon is terrible .
The full moon cracks them out and out , any one that would have any spleen or any relics in them .


Mrs. Broderick : Do not let in the light of it .
I would scruple to look at it myself .


Cracked Mary : Let you throw open the door , Davideen .
It is not ourselves are in dread that the white man in the sky will be calling names after us and ridiculing us .
Ha !
ha !
I might be as foolish as yourselves and as fearful , but for the Almighty that left a little cleft in my skull , that would let in His candle through the night time .


Hyacinth Halvey : Hurry on now , tell us is there any one in this place is wild and astray like yourself .


( He opens the door .
The light falls on him . )


Cracked Mary : ( Putting her hand on him . )
There was great shouting in the big round house , and you coming into it last night .


Hyacinth Halvey : What are you saying ?
I never went frolicking in the night time since the day I came into Cloon .


Cracked Mary : We were talking of it a while ago .
I knew you by the smile and by the laugh of you .
A queen having a yellow dress , and the hair on her smooth like marble .
All the dead of the village were in it , and of the living myself and yourself .


Hyacinth Halvey : I thought it was of Carrow she was talking  it is of the other world she is raving , and of the shadow-shapes of the forth .


Cracked Mary : You have the door open - the speckled horses are on the road !
- make a leap on the horse as it goes by , the horse that is without a rider .
Ca n't you hear them puffing and roaring ?
Their breath is like a fog upon the air .


Hyacinth Halvey : What you hear is but the train puffing afar off .


Cracked Mary : Make a snap at the bridle as it passes by the bush in the western gap .
Run out now , run , where you have the bare ridge of the world before you , and no one to take orders from but yourself , maybe , and God .


Hyacinth Halvey : Ah , what way can I run to any place !


Cracked Mary : Stop where you are , so .
In my opinion it is little difference the moon can see between the whole of ye .
Come on , Davideen , come out now , we have the wideness of the night before us .
O golden God !
All bad things quieten in the night time , and the ugly thing itself will put on some sort of a decent face !
Come out now to the night that will give you the song , and will show myself out as beautiful as Helen of the Greek gods , that hanged herself the day there first came a wrinkle on her face !


Davideen : ( Coming close , and taking her hand as he sings . )


Oh !
do n't you remember What our comrades called to us And they footing steps At the call of the moon ?
Come out to the rushes , Come out to the bushes , Where the music is called By the lads of Queen Anne !
( They look beautiful .
They dance and sing in perfect time as they go out . )
Peter Tannian : ( Closing the door , and pointing at Hyacinth , who stands gazing after them , and when the door is shut sits down thinking deeply . )
It is on him her judgment fell , and a clear judgment .
Shawn Early : She gave out that award fair enough .


Peter Tannian : Did you take notice , and he coming into the shed , he had like some sort of a little twist in his walk ?


Mrs. Broderick : I would be loth to think there would be any poison lurking in his veins .
Where now would it come from , and Cracked Mary 's dog being as good as no dog at all ?


Peter Tannian : It might chance , and he a child in the cradle , to get the bite of a dog .
It might be only now , its full time being come , its power would begin to work .


Mrs. Broderick : So it would too , and he but to see the shadow of the dog bit him in a body glass , or in the waves , and he himself looking over a boat , and as if called to throw himself in the tide .
But I would not have thought it of Mr. Halvey .
Well , it 's as hard to know what might be spreading abroad in any person 's mind , as to put the body of a horse out through a cambric needle .


( Hyacinth looks at them . )


Shawn Early : Be quiet now , he is going to say some word .


Hyacinth Halvey : There is a thought in my mind .
I think it was coming this good while .


Shawn Early : Whisht now and listen .


Hyacinth Halvey : I made a great mistake coming into this place .


Peter Tannian : There was some mistake made anyway .


Hyacinth : It is foolishness kept me in it ever since .
It is too big a name was put upon me .


Peter Tannian : It is the power of the moon is forcing the truth out of him .


Hyacinth Halvey : Every person in the town giving me out for more than I am .
I got too much of that in the heel .


Shawn Early : He is talking queer now anyway .


Hyacinth Halvey : Calling to me every little minute - expecting me to do this thing and that thing - watching me the same as a watchdog , their eyes as if fixed upon my face .


Mrs. Broderick : To be giving out such strange thoughts , he has n't much brains left around him .


Hyacinth Halvey : I looking to be Clerk of the Union , and the place I had giving me enough to do , and too much to do .
Tied on this side , tied on that side .
I to be bothered with business through the holy livelong day !


Peter Tannian : It is good pay he got with it .
Eighty pounds a year does n't come on the wind .


Hyacinth Halvey : In danger to be linked and wed - I never ambitioned it - with a woman would want me to be earning through every day of the year .


Shawn Early : He is a gone man surely .


Hyacinth Hakey : The wide ridge of the world before me , and to have no one to look to for orders  that would be better than roast and boiled and all the comforts of the day .
I declare to goodness , and I 'd nearly take my oath , I 'd sooner be among a fleet of tinkers , than attending meetings of the Board !


Mrs. Broderick : If there are fairies in it , it is in the fairies he is .


Peter Tannian : Give me a hold of that chain .


Mrs. Broderick : What is it you are about to do ?


Peter Tannian : To bind him to the chair I will before he will burst out wild mad .
Come over here , Bartley Fallon , and lend a hand if you can .


( Bartley Fallon appears from corner with a chicken crate over his head . )


Mrs. Broderick : O Bartley , that is the strangest lightness ever I saw , to go bind a chicken crate around your skull !


Bartley Fallon : Will you tighten the knots I have tied , Peter Tannian !
I am in dread they might slacken or fail .


Shawn Early : Was there ever seen before this night such power to be in the moon !


Bartley Fallon : It would seem to be putting very wild unruly thoughts a-through me , stirring up whatever spleen or whatever relics was left in me by the nature of the dog .


Peter Tannian : Is it that you think those rods , spaced wide , as they are , will keep out the moon from entering your brain ?


Bartley Fallon : There does great strength come at the time the wits would be driven out of a person .
I never was handled by a policeman - but once - and never hit a blow on any man .
I would not wish to destroy my neighbour or to have his blood on my hands .


Shawn Early : It is best keep out of his reach .


Bartley Fallon : The way I have this fixed , there is no person will be the worse for me .
I to rush down the street and to meet with my most enemy in some lonesome craggy place , it would fail me , and I thrusting for it to scatter any share of poison in his body or to sink my teeth in his skin .
I would n't wonder I to have hung for some of you , and that plan not to have come into my head .


( Whistle of train heard . )


Hyacinth Halvey : ( Getting up . )
I have my mind made up , I am going out of this on that train .


Peter Tannian : You are not going so easy as what you think .


Hyacinth Halvey : Let you mind your own business .


Peter Tannian : I am well able to mind it .


Hyacinth Halvey : ( Throwing off top-coat . )
You can not keep me here .


Peter Tannian : Give me a hand with the chain .
( They throw it round Hyacinth and hold him . )


Hyacinth Halvey : Is it out of your senses you are gone ?


Peter Tannian : Not at all , but yourself that is gone raving mad from the fury and the strength of some dog .


Miss Joyce : ( At door . )
Are you there , Hyacinth Halvey ?
The train is in .
Come forward now , and give a welcome to his Reverence .


Hyacinth Halvey : Let me go out of this !


Miss Joyce : You are near late as it is .
The train is about to start .


Hyacinth Halvey : Let me go , or I 'll tear the heart out of ye !


Shawn Early : Oh , he is stark , staring mad !


Hyacinth Halvey : Mad , am I ?
Bit by a dog , am I ?
You 'll see am I mad !
I 'll show madness to you !
Let go your hold or I 'll skin you !
I 'll destroy you !
I 'll bite you !
I 'm a red enemy to the whole of you !
Leave go your grip !
Yes , I 'm mad !
Bow wow wow , wow wow !


( They let go and fall back in terror , and he rushes out of the door . )


Miss Joyce : What at all has happened ?
Where is he gone ?


Shawn Early : To the train he is gone , and away in it he is gone .


Miss Joyce : He gave some sort of a bark or a howl .


Shawn Early : He is gone clean mad .
Great arguing he had , and leaping and roaring .


Bartley Fallon : ( Taking off crate . )
He went very near to tear us all asunder .
I declare I am n't worth a match .


Mrs. Broderick : He made a reel in my head , till I do n't know am I right myself .


Shawn Early : Bawling his life out , tearing his clothes , tearing and eating them .
Look at his top-coat he left after him .


Bartley Fallon : He poured all over with pure white foam .


Peter Tannian : There now is an end of your elegant man .


Shawn Early : Bit he was with the mad dog that went tearing , and lads chasing him a while ago .


Miss Joyce : Sure that was Tannian 's own dog , that had a bit of meat snapped from Quirke 's ass-car .
He is without this door now .
( All look out . )
He has the appearance of having a full meal taken .


Bartley Fallon : And they to be saying I went mad .
That is the way always , and a thing to be tasked to me that was not in it at all .


Mrs. Broderick : ( Laying her hand on Miss Joyce 's shoulder . )
Take comfort now  and if it was the moon done all , and has your bachelor swept , let you not begrudge it its full share of praise for the hand it had in banishing a strange bird , might have gone wild and bawling like eleven , and you after being wed with him , and would maybe have put a match to the roof .
And had n't you the luck of the world now , that you did not give notice to the priest !
