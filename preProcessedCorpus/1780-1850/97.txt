Dawson sitting at a Table with Wine  Glasses . ]
Dawson .
How a warm Glass comforts a man when he is out of spirits !
If I were to belong to this house in any other shape than that of Butler , I should be off in a month with the hip .
( 1 ) Yet I question if there 's another person in the World as sober as I am  or e ` en a one that would put up as affably with my lord 's tantarums  or , indeed , a more honest  agreeable Man in any shape of life  so that why I should not have as good a chance with Mrs. Innis as Mr. Davis has , I ca n't tell  unless , indeed , it be from my foolish own modesty , which is always hindering me from putting myself forward  so that nobody knows ,  nobody guesses one quarter of what I am worth .
- Ah !
My dear Mrs. Innis !
[ Enter Innis . ]
Innis .
O Mr. Dawson , I 'm so flustered - Dawson .
Flustered ?
At what ?
Innis .
Why I just walked out a little way on t ` other side the park pales ,  who should I come plump against , but that odd man we do n't know what to make of ?
Dawson .
What , the fellow who has was dodging about so all day yesterday ?
Innis .
The same ,  it has put me in such a flurry - ( 2 ) Dawson .
Did he say any thing ?
Innis .
Say any thing ?
He asked me questions by the hundred : how long we should stay here ,  whether our young Gentleman rode out ,  whether Mr. Valentine , in particular , - Dawson .
And why did not you call me to him ?
Innis .
Why ?
- why because I had a mind to walk on a little - only he put me in such a fright  he looked so black ,  so grim ,  so staring !
- Dawson .
Ah , Mrs. Innis , I am afraid I can guess why you wanted to walk that way alone : you expected Mr. Davis would be coming home ?
Innis .
Why you know , Mr. Dawson , such a heap of things has happened since he went away , that , to be sure , one should like to hear what he would say to them all .
However , I would not have had my dear young lady take your cross old lord for all the World .
They say he was not half so proud before he got his title , upon going that last time to the Indies , where he made his great fortune .
Dawson .
Why he was always pretty unbearable , Mrs. Innis .
Lauk !
to see his elder brother , Lord Exbury , that 's a natural lord , as one may say , being no more than what comes to him from Father to son , so genteel-behaved ,  so affable !
- while this , that only got it by fortunehunting , in comparison , to be so highty  imperial !
( 3 ) Innis .
Yes , lord Exbury 's the best man in the World  I  my young lady both think so .
But as to Lord Ardville , I  my young lady ca n't abide him .
He thinks himself so wise , too !
He pretends to be never in the wrong .
Dawson .
Very true , Mrs. Innis   of all things what I hate most , is a man 's singing his own praises .
My lord 's got such a trick of it , that it has made me take a resolve never to speak up for myself as long as I live  though I 'll consent to be hanged if I think I 've my fellow either for quickness or 3 honesty  or for sobriety , or , indeed , for the matter of that , for anything that 's proper  - but it 's what I make a rule never to say .
( 4 ) Innis .
O , you are so modest , Mr. Dawson !
Dawson .
Ah , Mrs. Innis , if I were but as happy as Mr. Davis !
to live under the same roof with you ,  to serve lord Exbury !
( 5 ) Innis .
Lord Exbury ( 6 ) is very good to Mr. Davis , to be sure , for he never thwarts him in any thing - except just to try to break him of that droll trick he has of talking so wide of the mark .
Dawson .
And if ever he breaks him of that , say my name is n't Dawson .
It 's in the very blood of him ,  he ca n't speak of a thing just as it is for his life .
If a house be large , 't is a Castle  if small , it wo n't do for a pig-stie : if a Man be weak , he ca n't wrestle with a doll  if strong , he can twist round a lion with the tip of his little finger .
For every five , he counts fifty ,  for every fifty , five hundred .
Innis .
Well , Mr. Dawson , he 's very agreeable if he does   he means no harm , I am sure .
Dawson .
Harm ?
no  he 's a good fellow Mrs. Innis  I know that  as faithful a good fellow as ever lived   Lord Exbury has checked him so often for speaking so out of the way , that he begins to try to check himself , now   as soon as he has said a thing in a full hearty voice , that not a sould can believe , he 'll sneak back , in a small little tone , to the plain truth , like a school boy at sight of a rod .
Innis [ aside ] .
What a spite he has to poor Mr. Davis !
 he never sees , the whole time , he 's the mere ape of his own lord , puff , puff , puffing himself !
[ Enter Davis , booted  spurred , followed by the Strange Man . ]
Innis .
O Mr. Davis , I 've so many things to tell you !
- Strange Man .
I hope , your Honour - Davis .
What do you follow me in for , friend ?
The house is n't mine , I tell you .
Innis .
O lud !
it 's the odd man !
Dawson .
What do you do here , Mister ?
What do you come into the house for ?
Strange Man .
I do n't come a begging , your honour  I only axes for a cup of beer   just to rest me a bit .
Dawson .
Get out this minute , sirrah !
Strange Man .
Would not your honours like a merry song ?
or a comical story ?
Davis .
O , if you can sing a song , my boy - Dawson .
Get out of the house , I say !
If my lord should come home , he 'd blow us all the the Devil .
Strange Man .
Would a ' so ?
'T is to be hoped , then , we should have his worshipful Lordship along with us .
I likes good company .
( 7 ) Dawson .
You impudent rogue !
[ drives him out . ]
Innis .
I never saw such a nasty black bold-looking man in my days !
Who can he be ?
Dawson .
A thief , I make no doubt .
( 8 ) Innis .
Lud !
I hope I 've lost nothing !
[ feeling in her pockets . ]
Davis .
A theif ?
no  he 'd wait for the night then .
I take 4 him for some spy .
Innis .
A spy ?
Lud , Mr. Davis , who does he come to spy ?
Dawson .
No , no  he would not go about so like a scrub ( 9 ) if he were a spy .
Davis .
Well a fortune teller , at least .
Innis .
A fortune-teller ?
O lud !
What did you send him away for , then ?
I 'd rather have my fortune told than any thing .
I 'll run and make somebody call him back .
Davis .
My dear Mrs. Innis , let me go for you .
Dawson .
No , let me Mrs. Innis .
- Innis .
No , no , stay both where you are .
I 'll have him into the house-keeper 's room .
You must neither of you come .
I 'll let nobody hear what my fortune is - till I know how I like it .
[ Exit in haste . ]
Davis .
Well , Mr. Dawson , I am glad , however , to hve caught you toping .
Shall I pledge you ?
Dawson .
With all my heart .
I scorn to drink alone .
[ helping him . ]
Davis .
So do I , too  - When I do n't pay for the Wine .
[ aside . ]
Dawson .
You are come back to very bad news , Mr. Davis  our two lords have had a quarrel .
Davis .
Have they ?
They I 'll venture what you will the fault is all lord Ardville 's  for as to my own lord , you ca n't find out he has one in the World , if you 'd give a thousand pound a piece for them .
What will you bet of that , Mr. Dawson ?
I 'll lay you twenty thousand pounds to ten .
Dawson .
I never lay more than I can pay , Mr. Davis .
Davis .
Come , then , a shilling !
a shilling to sixpence ?
But pray , what 's the quarrel about ?
Dawson .
Why you know we have all long seen how sweet my old lord has looked upod Miss Hilaria Dalton , sour as he is to every body else :  , last night , he came to the point ,  downright asked her to marry him .
Did you ever hear of such an old dotard ?
Davis .
Yes , of a million such , at least !
But poor Mr. Valentine !
he 'll shoot himself , to be sure !
( 10 ) that 's no more than one must naturally expect from him .
( 11 ) Dawson .
And what for ?
Davis .
Why do n't you know he 's so in love with Miss Hilaria , that he reckons it a crime to eat , drink , or sleep , for fear it should put him off from thinking of her ?
And when she refused him , though it was plain she liked him as well as he liked her , we were all sure , among ourseves , it was only because she was waiting for this offer from his rich old uncle .
Dawson .
But she has refused the rich old uncle , too .
Davis .
Refused lord Ardville ?
I 'll give her a kiss the next time I see her .
( 12 ) Dawson .
You ?
You kiss Miss Dalton ?
Davis .
Nay , I do n't mean quite a kiss - but I 'll make her the handsomest bow she ever saw in her life .
Look !
[ Bowing grotesquely . ]
( 13 ) Dawson .
You may guess what a rage this has put my lord 5 in .
He threw all the blame directly upon Lord Exbury , ( 14 )  was so over above rude to him , that the poor worthy Gentleman ordered his carriages to be ready this morning for leaving us , though but one week is over of the month he came to spend here .
Davis .
My dear good lord !
And he was so troubled already , what with debts of Mr. Mordaunt ,  what with Miss Hilaria refusing Mr. Valentine , that you might hear him sigh half a mile off !
My dear good lord !
to be so used !
I 'd die an hundred times a day , with pleasure , to serve him .
Dawson .
And I 'd let my lord die as many to serve me !
There 's the difference .
But , would you believe it , Mr. Davis ?
no sooner was breakfast over this morning , than out goes my lord ,  vows he wo n't come home again till the house is cleared of his relations ?
boasting , all the time , after his old way , that there is not his like , high or low , for discovering what every body 's at .
Davis .
Yes , he 's a special wise-acre .
( 15 ) He do n't believe his Equal is to be found in the whole World - no , not if Captain Cooke ( 16 ) were brought to life again , on purpose to go around it ,  look him out .
Dawson .
Well , of all things , what I ca n't put up with is a Man 's vaunting himself so .
Any thing else I can excuse , be it what it will , because I am one that hate to find fault  for , indeed , I can safely say , as to the matter of that , that as for good-nature , or kindness , or obligingness , you may go the whole country about before you 'll meet with my fellow .
Davis .
Pray did not I see Sir Achy Fineer 's carriage as I passed by the coach-house ?
Dawson .
Yes , Sir Achy came from town this morning , has been close closetted with your two young Gentlemen till within this house   now he 's with your lord himself .
Davis .
I must stay , then , till he is gone , for my business must be a secret to the very Walls : - though I might just as well have sone it here  too , after riding all about the country , miles  miles , up  down , round  round , I 've fixed upon a spot close by .
Dawson .
What spot , Mr. Davis ?
Davis .
Spot , did I say ?
- well , if I did - but remember !
it 's a secret of state !
- Only between my lord  me .
Why he bid me go and hire , out of hand , a small neat ready-furnished house , in the most retired place I could find :  I have met with one just down that pretty valley to the right of your Park .
Dawson .
Why , as sure as can be , it 's the haunted house , then ?
Davis .
Haunted ?
[ Enter Innis , tittering . ]
Innis .
O Mr. Davis !
O Mr. Dawson !
I 've had my fortune told !
- But I wo n't let you know what it is !
- but it 's very good , I assure you !
- A young Gentleman - but I wo n't tell you a word !
- Davis .
I hope , Mrs. Innis , you do n't mind - Innis [ laughing ] .
Yes , I do mind , Mr. Davis !
Dawson .
No , sure , Mrs. Innis , I hope you do n't care - Innis .
Yes , I do care , Mr. Dawson !
Dawson .
I 'll thrash the rascal out of the house this minute !
[ Exit . ]
[ Davis .
Innis . ]
Innis .
6 O no , do n't !
do n't !
All the maids want to have their fortunes told ,  he says he has a mind to tell Mr. Valentine his .
Dawson .
( 17 ) Mr. Valentine ?
Does he think - Innis .
Yes , he asked a heap of questions about Mr. Valentine - but he did not tell me Mr. Valentine was the young Gentleman he meant - nor yet Mr. Mordaunt  - nor yet Sir Archy Fineer .
He woud not own who it was , all I could say  But he said I should be sure to find it out .
Davis .
But , who ever it is , Mrs. Innis , you would not forget - Innis .
Would not I , Mr. Davis ?
Davis .
No , you would not be so unkind - Innis .
What , not if a Conjuror made me ?
Davis .
No , I am sure you would not .
Innis .
Yes , I should , Mr. Davis !
- as sure as you stand there !
[ Exit , giggling . ]
[ Davis looks aghast .
Enter Dawson . ]
Dawson .
I have shown the rogue the way out of doors , to a tune that will prevent him , I believe , from being in a hurry to come within them again .
What 's the matter with you , Mr. Davis ?
Davis .
Nothing - nothing .
- She 's only at one of her jokes , I dare say .
[ aside . ]
What was that you were talking of about that house being haunted ?
Dawson .
Why , a lady died there , lately , in one of the rooms ,  she has been seen there since !
And , once , she appeared to old Mr. Litchburn .
Davis .
What , does Mr. Litchburn believe in Ghosts ?
Why I could just as soon believe we were all walking upon our heads ,  did not know them from our heels .
He 's a sad noodle , that old Mr , Litchburn .
He stares so , sometimes , at a mere nothing , that , once or twice , I could almost take my bible oath I saw both his eyes walk out of his head !
Dawson .
Yet he 's the only person that comes nigh us .
My lord 's frightened away every body else , - except just on public days .
( 18 ) Now Pride is a thing no one can accuse Me of  for though I do n't like to talk of my own good qualities , I can fairly say , that there is not perhaps in the whole kingdom a Person that has a better temper than I have .
Davis .
Poor Mr. Litchburn !
To come but into the house of a lord he thinks will be the making of him .
And he 's so dull , that he do n't understand above one half what Lord Ardville says ,  so must put up with t ` other half .
Dawson .
But that is n't all : about twenty years ago , my lord got him a kind of a sort of a very poor place  so he comes here every day , paying his court , in hopes he 'll change it for a better .
Davis .
Ay , poor stupid noddy !
( 19 ) Cringe , cringe , cringe - bowing the lower for every affront !
But if he were to be pulled by the nose ,  it were by a lord , - he 'd be proud of the honour .
Dawson .
Hark !
I think I hear him with the Porter .
Now he 'll come  stay an hour , humming and hawing ,  spelling over every thing one says , word by word - a tiresome old drone !
Davis .
O , I 'll hoax him off in a few minutes .
You shall see .
Only tell him of the quarrel here ,  I 'll put all the fault of it upon him .
He 's soon frightened   he takes every syllable one speaks for Gospel .
[ Enter Mr. Litchburn . ]
7 Litchburn .
Good morrow , to you , good Mr. Dawson .
Good Mr. Davis , good morrow to you .
The worthy Porter tells me my Lord Ardville is gone abroad .
I just come to ask you , my good Gentlemen , if you think his good lordship will be pleased to condescend to expect I should do myself the honour to wait in the ante-room ?
Dawson .
Why , really , it 's hard to say , Mr. Litchburn , for yesterday evening my lord fell out with the whole family .
It 's all what you may call a civil War .
Litchburn .
Civil , Mr. Dawson ?
I do n't mean to find fault , but if you call that civil , I am sure I do n't know what 's rude .
Dawson .
O , that 's only a way of speaking , as one may say  it has not much meaning .
But my lord has disinherited the whole race of 'em , one after t ` other .
Litchburn .
I ca n't say but I am somewhat sorry to hear it - not that I take such a liberty as to surmise such a notion as that my Lord Ardville is not in the right - Heaven forbid I should so forget myself !
- but my lord Exbury is so good - and he is so hard put to it by his eldest son , Mr. Mordaunt , as I hear - though I do n't say it in any blame of the young Gentleman .
I hope I know what becomes me better .
But he is a sad hand , that Mr. Mordaunt .
He cares for nothing  nobody .
If the youngest had been the eldest - Dawson .
Ay , every body has a good word for Mr. Valentine .
Litchburn .
But what is it has so disordered my worthy patron , my good Gentlemen ?
Dawson.Why Miss Hilaria Dalton has given him the go by .
Litchburn .
You do n't say so ?
Dear Heart !
He must be sore affronted !
We all thought it as good as a matrimony over .
Dawson .
And he will have it , because Lord Exbury is her guardian , it was he made her refuse him   both his nephews , as well as his niece , he says , helped .
Every body 's in fault , by what I can make out .
Litchburn .
Every body ?
Not poor I , I hope , Mr. Dawson ?
Davis .
O yes  you were the first person he mentioned , as being the worst .
Litchburn .
I ?
Dear Heart !
Davis .
Yes  for he hays , if it had not been for you , he should not have made the offer .
Litchburn .
For me ?
- This is quite the extraordinary !
Why I never spoke a word about it !
nor even had so much as a thought , if I may be believed !
Davis .
He has been stamping about his room these two hours ,  saying , says he , if it has not been for that old fool Litchburn , says he - Litchburn .
Dear Heart !
old fool , did his lordship say ?
Davis .
If it had not been , says he , as I said before , for that old fool Litchburn , this would never have happened , for it was only upon his advice I acted .
Litchburn .
Dear Heart , how my lord can say so !
However , if he 's so angry , it 's as well not contradict him  so take no notice of my denying it , my good Gentlemen : but , if I may be believed , I never presumed to open my lips upon such a thing since the hour I was born .
However , if he is so out of sorts , I had almost as lief put off the pleasure of having the honour of paying my respects to him , till he has got the better of it .
It 8 may only be troublesome  for I have not any thing particular to say .
So I would not disturb his lordship just for nothing .
Good morning , Mr. Dawson .
Mr. Davis , good morning .
You 'll take no notice of my calling - Dear Heart !
that 's his lordship 's voice !
- I wish I could slip out !
- Ca n't you let me just pass that way , Mr. Dawson ?
- [ Enter the Porter . ]
Porter .
My lord is just returned  but he only enquired if the family was set off ,  if Mr. Litchburn had called   then went down towards the valley on foot ,  desired that Mr. Litchburn would be so good as to follow ,  walk with him .
Litchburn .
Dear heart !
how unlucky I had not slid away !
Porter .
My lord says he ca n't wait a minute .
Litchburn .
My lord wait ?
No , to be sure , Mr. Porter !
I hope I know better what an honour it is to walk with my lord .
I am coming with the greatest haste .
- Dear Heart !
I wish I were further - if it were not for the honour !
[ Exit . ]
Davis .
Well , now , I would not have taken an hundred pound not to have frightened that old Toby !
( 20 ) - that is , not five shilling , I am sure .
Porter .
My lord asked for you too , Mr. Dawson .
[ Exit . ]
Dawson .
I do n't doubt he did .
He can never be quiet two minutes without me .
And , indeed , for that matter , little as I like to say any thing in my own favour , if ever he 'll meet with another man as useful about his affairs , or one half as serviceable to him as I am - I 'll give him my wages for nothing .
[ Exit . ]
Davis .
There 's a swaggerer , now !
( 21 ) For my part , I like nothing but plain speech .
But I 'd give , this very moment , a thousand pound out of my pocket , to trounce that fortune-teller , for putting young Gentlemen into Mrs. Innis 's head - at least , a good half Crown .
[ Exit . ]
Scene 2 [ A magnificent Drawing Room . ]
Miss Exbury .
This charming Sir Achy Fineer !
how amazingly lucky he arrived before we were gone !
I wonder [ taking out a pocket mirror ] how my hair looks - O , not amiss .
I was sure that last ball would decide him .
My dress was so becoming - I wonder if he will speak to Papa first , or to me .
- Hilaria !
[ Enter Hilaria . ]
Hilaria .
O Miss Exbury , I bring you the most enchanting news !
That divine cousin of mine , Sir Archy Fineer - Miss Exbury .
Pho - la !
- what makes you suppose - how can you even imagine - dear Miss Dalton , what can Sir Archy Fineer be to me ?
Hilaria .
To you ?
he is the most delightful creature upon earth to every body !
He has just sent in cards to us all for a most superb fête to be given at his house next Tuesday .
Miss Exbury .
A fête ?
Indeed ?
Dear !
- I wonder who it 's for !
Do you think he has any particular object in view ?
Hilaria .
Every object , I doubt not , that is pretty , or brilliant , or fashionable , throughout the metropolis .
Miss Exbury .
We shall just arrive in Grosvenor Square ( 22 ) time enough to make our preparations .
How amazingly lucky Papa  my Uncle have quarreled !
Hilaria .
The most fortunate thing in the world - though I am grieved at any vexation to Lord Exbury .
9 Miss Exbury .
But is not Sir Archy very angry at your rejecting my uncle Ardville ?
Hilaria .
Angry ?
He is enraged .
He has gathered it , I know not how , from the servants ,  vows he shall never rest till he brings the union to bear .
Union !
What a word !
Miss Exbury .
Nay , Miss Dalton , if to preside in Fashion would make you happy - Hilaria .
Yes , I acknowledge , as Lady Ardville I might be its very Empress - And nobody would like it better .
But though , at a distance , Fashion seemed all I desired , when the decision rested with myself , my lord Ardville - pardon me , my dear Miss Exbury , I would not say any thing shocking of your Uncle - but really , his counteneance - his deportment - his Eyes - Oh !
Miss Exbury .
'T is all true  yet if Love alond could have sufficed , my brother Valentine - Hilaria .
Nay , did I ever deny that your Brother - that Valentine - but do n't let me talk nonsense .
With my pitiful six thousand , joined to his pitiful five , we must both have been poor  obscure ,  , consequently , miserable .
( 23 ) Miss Exbury .
Will you never , then , marry , till you can unite Love with Fashion ?
Hilaria .
Never !
Miss Exbury .
But pray , now , do tell me , - do n't you think it is amazingly odd that Sir Archy Fineer should come down to my Uncle Ardville 's ?
Hilaria .
Not at all .
He 's my cousin , you know .
Miss Exbury .
How blind she is !
as if people came to see their relations !
[ aside ] You do n't imagine , then , Miss Dalton , that he had any sort of -- rather -- particular inducement ?
Hilaria .
I have hardly seen him yet .
He had been with Lord Exbury , or with your Brothers all the morning .
Miss Exbury .
With my Brothers ?
- Indeed !
Hilaria .
Yes .
Miss Exbury .
O then , I am sure ... Do pray tell me if my Hair ... do n't it look horrible ?
And this frightful dress - is it not amazingly unbecoming ?
I never happenned ( 24 ) to put my things on so ill before .
A n't I quite horrid ?
Hilaria .
By no means .
You look remarkably well .
But I must run and see whether Sir Archy has left Lord Exbury , for I have ten thousand enquiries to make of him .
How I long to be gone ,  quit the dreary , drowsy country , for London - animated London !
[ Exit . ]
Miss Exbury .
I would give the World I had put on something prettier to day !
Sir Archy has such delightful taste !
- How happy I shall be with him !
I wonder what settlement he will offer .
( 25 ) Something very handsome , I make no doubt .
But - do I look so remarkably well , I wonder ?
[ taking out the pocket mirror . ]
[ Re-enter Hilaria . ]
Hilaria .
O Miss Exbury , I am quite alarmed !
Intending to pass through the next room , which I thought empty , I surprised Lord Exbury alone , leaning upon a Table , with an air so absorbed  melancholy , so unlike his usually serene c.earful appearance , that I started back : but , hearing me open the door , he raised his Eyes ,  I saw in them an expression of care  disturbance that struck me to the heart .
I instantly withdrew  but heard him sigh so heavily , I would have given the World to have 10 offered him some consolation .
Miss Exbury [ to herself ] .
I am sadly afraid it 's because he do n't like Sir Archy !
- so I suppose I shall have to go to Gretna Green !
( 26 ) - and I have no tolerable travelling dress ready !
- How tormenting !
- Nothing in the least becoming !
- And Sir Archy is so elegant !
- he 'll hate any thing not pretty .
Hilaria .
To see Lord Exbury , my dear  honoured Guardian afflicted , makes me quite unhappy .
Surely he , whose whole study is to turn sorrow from others , should be spared it himself !
Miss Exbury .
I wonder what he has said about pin-money [ aside ] ( 27 ) - O , here 's papa !
[ Enter Lord Exbury . ]
Lord Exbury .
I fear , my dear Hilaria , I have startled you .
I need not , I am sure , say how unintentionally .
I must the less , however , regret it , since imperious necessity compels my immediate disclosure of the uneasiness with which you saw me oppressed .
Hilaria .
Uneasiness ?
Dear my lord !
- Miss Exbury [ to herself ] .
I am afraid Sir Archy has offered something shabby .
Lord Exbury .
I will but enquire if Davis is returned , and then , my dear Girl , [ to Miss Exbury ] I must unfold to you - Alas , perforce !
- a tale that will demand your fortitude as much as your attention .
Miss Exbury [ to herself ] .
Yes , his proposals have certainly been very paltry !
I could never have suspected Sir Archy of such meanness .
I wo n't go to Gretna Green with him , I 'm resolved .
` Twould be very indelicate .
[ Enter Davis . ]
Lord Exbury .
O , Davis , you are come ?
Follow me to my room .
The orders I have to give you admit no delay .
Hilaria .
Speak to him here , my dear lord ,  let us retire till you summon us .
Miss Exbury [ to herself ] .
How vexatious to go without hearing what he has said about the pin-money !
For , after all , very likely it has beenvery handsome .
I dare say it 's only Papa 's prejudice against Sir Archy .
[ Exeunt Miss Exbury  Hilaria . ]
Lord Exbury .
Well , Davis , have you had any success ?
Have you seen any small house , or cottage , fitted for the style  family I described to you ?
Davis .
O , a thousand , my lord !
- one , however , hard by , that will just do .
Lord Exbury .
Hard by ?
I am sorry for that !
But I foresaw not , when I gave you the commission , the events which now make this vicinity unpleasant to me .
Have you seen nothing of this description more distant ?
Davis .
Nothing , my lord , that 's been lived in so lately .
The old house-keeper who shewed me this , told me its owners had not left it an hour .
- That is , - not a week .
Lord Exbury .
It will be well-aired , then ,  every thing now must yield to that recommendation .
Hasten back , therefore ,  see ( 28 ) that it be instantly secured  prepared .
Davis .
It is completely ready now , my lord .
Lord Exbury .
We are all going hence , Davis , immediately .
Davis .
To London , my lord , to day ?
Lord Exbury .
11 No , Davis , nor to-morrow .
I know not when I may see London again .
Davis .
I dare say , my lord , Sims will have kept the house always ready for your lordship 's return .
Lord Exbury .
I have ordered it to be sold .
Davis .
Your lordship means to live entirely in the country , then ?
Lord Exbury .
How far distant is this cottage ?
Davis .
Not three inches out of the Park , my lord - not five yards , I am sure .
Which of your lordship 's seats am I to order to be got ready ?
Exbury Hall ?
Lord Exbury .
I have directed it should be let .
Davis .
Let ?
- O , then - we are alltogether [ sic ] at Spring Lawn ?
Lord Exbury .
I have instructed Sims to have that advertised .
Davis .
My lord ?
Lord Exbury .
I mean , for the present , to reside at this cottage .
Order the carriages , therefore , directly .
Davis .
This cottage , my lord ?
Why it is n't so big as a nut-shell !
- not big enough , however , for a squirrel to nibble one in .
Lord Exbury .
It will the better suit me !
[ Sighing . ]
Davis .
Besides , my lord , people say it 's haunted !
Lord Exbury .
I have no time ,  no taste , Davis , for idle stories .
Davis .
It wo n't hold half the household .
Lord Exbury .
My household will be more than half diminished .
Davis .
Mercy on me !
Lord Exbury .
You are a good fellow , Davis ,  though extravagant in speech , honest at heart .
I have long found you a faithful , as well as a useful , domestic .
It is painful to me to explain myself , but a calamity has fallen upon my family , that makes it necessary I should change my whole mode of living .
Davis .
Good lauk !
- but I hope , at least , - Lord Exbury .
I am sensible of your good will , Davis  but send off without delay to settle every thing for our reception .
Davis .
Am I not to write for some of the servants from town , my lord ?
Lord Exbury .
I have employed Sims to discharge them all .
Davis .
Good lauk !
good lauk !
- Lord Exbury .
'T was an ungrateful office , but indispensible .
If I am able , some years hence , to resume my usual mode of life , I shall seek them all back   , if any of them are not better provided for , gladly open my house to them .
Pray , be quick .
Davis .
But I hope , my lord , - I hope , my most honoured lord - Lord Exbury .
Send my daughter to me as you pass ,  lose no more time .
12 Davis .
Forgive me , my lord , - pray do - pray forgive me - but - Lord Exbury .
What is the matter Davis ?
Davis .
Only just let me make bold to ask - I hope , my lord , such an old servant as I am i 'n' t to be discharged with the rest ?
Lord Exbury .
I thank you , Davis  but your situation would be so changed , as to lose as much in pleasure as in profit .
Davis .
O my dear lord !
I have been paid , an hundred and an hundred fold , for all my poor services already .
Lord Exbury .
I am glad you think so .
But the place would be too hard for you .
I shall keep , at present , only two men for everything , and - Davis .
I will do the work of twenty -  twenty million , my dear lord !
- to stay with you !
- Lord Exbury .
My good Davis !
[ laying his hand upon Davis 's shoulder . ]
We will surely , then , never part .
I shall consider you , henceforth , as a friend .
Davis .
My honoured lord !
- I feel so proud !
- I ca n't - hardly - keep the tears from my Eyes !
Lord Exbury .
Worthy creature !
- but hasten to my arrangements .
I will go to my daughter , however , myself .
Your countenance , at this moment , would but give her new alarm .
[ Exit . ]
Davis .
My dear good lord !
- He has one comfort left , however , for he sees , now , that I serve him without the lucre of gain :  that 's more than that proud , ill-natured Lord Ardville , with all his fortune , will ever ( 29 ) see , if he should live to be ninety methusalahs .
( 30 ) Well , by what I can make out , your lords are much like other men  some good , some bad .
My own 's of the best   I would not but serve him , now he can hardly pay me , to be made forty Emperors - at least , not a Justice of the Peace .
And , if Mrs. Innis would but think no more about young Gentlemen , I had just as lief be poor as rich - - that is , - if I ca n't help it !
END OF ACT I Act II Scene 1 [ The Drawing Room at Lord Ardville 's . ]
Hilaria .
The secret must ere now be revealed to Miss Exbury .
My heart is very heavy about this good and dear old lord  and not very light , I am afraid , about his son !
How odd it is I never can get that Valentine out of my head !
Do what I will , try how I may , turn which way I can , - still he rises uppermost in my thoughts .
If it had not been for Sir Archy - but how glad I am I resisted !
Yet I have never been happy since !
- but I have been gay - so nobody has found it out .
[ Enter Lord Exbury . ]
My lord !
Lord Exbury .
I thought I should have met you in the room with my Daughter .
Hilaria .
Shall I call Miss Exbury , my lord ?
Lord Exbury .
By no means .
I have stated to her all it is essential she should learn , and I am better satisfied to speak with you alone .
Hilaria .
Should he name Valentine !
- [ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
The solemn trust with which my friend , your Father , left you to my guardianship , your residence in my family , and still more , if possible , the endearing disposition with which you have captivated all our hearts - 13 Hilaria .
He is coming to Valentine !
- [ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
- Are circumstances which do not give me more pleasure , from the confidence with which they urge me to treat you , than pain , at this moment , from the nature of my present communication .
Hilaria .
I am sure , my lord , if I thought - I am sure , my lord , I - I - He will plead for Valentine , and I shall never withstand him !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
The evil which must now burst publicly upon my house , has long hung upon my apprehensions  yet , while I saw any chance it might be averted , I confined them to my own bosom .
The time is over now for concealment : it is over for hope !
In one word , I must renounce the world for the present myself , or know I shall leave my children to obscurity and distress .
Hilaria .
Is it possible !
Lord Exbury .
You will easily trace the cause to its source : the extravagances of my son Mordaunt are at least not darkened by hypocrisy , for he does not more carelessly involve than unconcernedly betray himself - not , alas !
- as you will know - from frankness of character , but from deeming it fine to be wholly indifferent to the opinions and the feelings of others .
Hilaria .
I have long feared he was imprudent , but suspected not how widely .
Lord Exbury .
Three or four years of retirement and oeconomy may yet retrieve his fortune and credit , and enable me to secure his sister 's portion from any mischief through a future relapse into the same courses : for though I mean severely to probe , and hope a little to touch him , I dare not build upon much stability of repentance from a disposition which submits to be guided by the fluctuating breath of Fashion .
Hilaria .
How I grieve for you , my lord !
- yet - I wish he would not speak with such contempt of Fashion !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
Numberless have been my efforts to convince his mind , and induce him to retrench his expences : but there is a madness in the times that sets Reason at naught , and commits conviction to punishment .
His creditors are now come upon him in a body , his resources are at an end , and his character , and my name - are disgraced together !
Hilaria .
Your name ?
O no , my lord !
Your name , established by your own unsullied life , must be respected as long as it can be remembered .
Lord Exbury .
Yesterday he confessed to me his situation , and informed me of a compromise to which his creditors had agreed , but which he had no means to fulfil without my aid .
As he seasoned the avowal by a promise to be wholly directed by me , I formed at once the plan I am now going to execute : I ordered the immediate discharge of all my servants , the sale of my town house and furniture - Hilaria .
Oh !
Lord Exbury .
And that both my villas should be let upon a three years lease .
I then sent off Davis in search of a cheap asylum for myself and family .
Hilaria .
I am thunderstruck !
Lord Exbury .
Yet I then thought I had three Weeks before me for preparation  but when I acquainted my Brother Ardville with my design , his reluctance to lose sight of his fair Enslaver , precipitated the proposals of which the failure has caused this general breach .
The violence of his displeasure , which obliges me thus suddenly to quit his house , forces from me also this abrupt communication .
Your cousin , Sir Archy Fineer , 14 who has been agent , I find , for Mordaunt , with his chief creditors , has come hither this morning to acquaint us that the compromise is arranged .
All is now ready for our removal .
I grieve for my poor Girl  but Mordaunt engages to subscribe to any reform  and Valentine - Hilaria .
I wish I were safe in town !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
Valentine , whose little independent fortune , left him by his aunt , is in no danger from this storm , has youth , and , I think , talents .
I am not uneasy for him .
He will be my best support .
Hilaria .
What next !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
But with regard to you , my dear Hilaria - I have , indeed , much solicitude .
I can not expect you should shut yourself up with us in the country - Hilaria .
Indeed , my lord , if you knew half my concern for this affair - or half the reverence I bear for you - Lord Exbury .
I know your kindness of Heart ,  am but too sensible of the loss we shall all sustain by the deprivation of your society - though you will permit me , I trust , to hope we shall not entirely lose sight of you ?
Where-ever you fix your abode , you will come to us , I must flatter myself , sometimes , for a week or two , in the summer ?
Hilaria .
In the summer ?
My dearest lord Exbury !
- my honoured Guardian !
- I will come to you at all seasons - or , rather , I will quit you in none !
Take me with you , my dear lord , whither soever you go !
Lord Exbury .
My amiable Ward !
You oblige , penetrate me !
- From Valentine - Hilaria .
I am undone !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
You must be sure you have nothing to fear from Vlentine .
You have thought him romantic , but you will never find him ungenerous .
He proposed himself with an idea - vain , perhaps , but not unnatural , that you might both relinquish the luxuries - the nominal ones - of the World , for the sake of each other  he is now separately driven from them himself by the fall of his family : he will propose , therefore , no more , since the sacrifice would no longer be mutual , nor voluntary .
I hear the Horses .
I must return to my poor Girl .
[ Exit . ]
Hilaria .
He will propose to me no more !
-  Lord Exbury is not uneasy for him ?
- I have a great mind not to be of the party .
- Yet , to abandon this admirable man - my friend , my Guardian - in his fallen state - abominable !
detestable !
No !
I 'll go with him -  I 'll stay with him - but as to Valentine - How I wish I could keep him from my thoughts !
[ Enter Porter . ]
Porter .
The carriages are at the door , ma'am .
[ Exit . ]
Hilaria .
I come .
What a glance shall I have from Valentine , when he hears my resolution to live with him - with them , I mean !
- in the country !
Ah , if I trust myself to meet his Eyes , Love will win the day ,  Fashion may resent it at leisure !
No !
I wo n't look at him !
[ Exit . ]
Scene 2 [ A Country Landscape , with a view of Lord Ardville 's House  Park .
Enter Mr. Litchburn . ]
Litchburn .
I do n't see which way my lord is  but I must needs stop a little , I am so tired .
I ca n't but say that I had as lief he had not asked for me - if it were not for the honour !
Being always looked down upon keeps a man 's spirit under surprisingly .
If a poor dependant did but dare speak out , how many things his Patron would hear that , naturally , he does not much dream of !
But the lower a man is ,  the more he has to 15 say , the less he must come out with it .
O - here is my lord .
[ Enter Lord Ardville . ]
Lord Ardville .
Yes !
I penetrate into the mystery without difficulty .
'T was a family compact .
They think to secure my Estate to themselves , by instigating this silly chit ( 31 ) to refuse me .
'T is vainly , however , they seek to deceive me !
To form a wrong judgement is a weakness that has never happenned to me yet .
Their mercenary malice shall recoil to its source .
I must repress my resentment , however ,  , for my own honour 's sake , take care that the secret not be spread .
Litchburn .
My lord !
- [ advancing fearfully ,  bowing at every step . ]
Lord Ardville .
O , good Morning , Mr. Litchburn .
I shall discover from this Ideot if any rumour of my rejection be got abroad [ aside . ] .
I was afraid , Mr. Litchburn , you did not mean to do me the favour of following me .
Litchburn .
Yes , I did , my lord , indeed !
Lord Ardville .
You did ?
You think it a favour , then ?
Litchburn .
If it 's your lordship 's pleasure , I 'll think it so , to be sure !
Lord Ardville .
May I take the liberty , sir , to ask what it was brought you to my house just now ?
Litchburn .
What brought me , my lord ?
I never come but on foot .
Lord Ardville .
I did not mean to enquire about your equipage , Sir !
What an empty Fellow !
[ half apart . ]
Litchburn [ overhearing him ] .
Empty ?
I 'm sure I have eat as good a dinner - but great folks always suspect one come to eat !
[ aside . ]
Lord Ardville .
I fear I have betrayed some disorder .
I must not have him think me piqued .
[ aside . ]
My good Mr. Litchburn , I only want to know if any body has been babbling to you - that is , if you came this Morning with any particular curiosity or design ?
But I see you did !
- Nay , do n't deny it !
Litchburn .
Design , my good lord ?
I am sure I may safely say I never had any designs in the course of my whole life .
Lord Ardville .
You 'll pardon me , Mr. Litchburn !
I am not very apt to be mistaken .
It is not a thing to which you will very commonly find me addicted .
Think again !
Litchburn .
I will , my lord .
[ bowing . ]
Lord Ardville .
Well , sir ?
Litchburn .
Your lordship is the best judge , to be sure , my lord  but if I came for any thing else - it 's quite unknown to me !
- though I do n't in the least mean to doubt of it .
Lord Ardville .
And what did you find all my people about ?
Litchburn .
Nothing , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
Their usual employment !
- But of what did they talk ?
Did they open their budget of family scandal to you ?
Litchburn .
They opened nothing before me , my lord , to the best of my recollection .
Lord Ardville .
What a literal blockhead !
But what did you pick up ?
[ aside . ]
Litchburn .
Nothing , as I hope to live , my good lord !
16 [ spreading his hands . ]
Lord Ardville .
What a consummate driveler !
[ aside . ]
In one word - Who 's that ?
[ The Strange Man crosses the stage . ]
Litchburn .
My lord , it 's somewhat surprising , but I ca n't rightly tell myself !
though it 's a person that I met yesterday no less than three times .
But we have interchanged nothing in the discourse way .
And what 's the extraordinary , is , that nobody here-abouts knows so much as an iota of what he may have in his head .
Lord Ardville .
Be so good , then , as either to learn his business , or give him to understand I allow of no person 's patroling about my grounds unexamined .
Litchburn .
I will , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
Stay , Mr. Litchburn  tell me , first , and without scruple - did my people insinuate any thing to you relative to ... to ... Miss Dalton ?
I see , by your look , how it is !
I do n't very customarily form a wrong opinion .
They spoke to you , then , did they ?
- They fabricated an hundred falsehoods ?
- Hay ?
- Litchburn .
I did not take any particular account , indeed , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
Perhaps you think it all truth ?
Hay ?
- And you mean to run all round the neighbourhood to promulgate it ?
Litchburn .
I run , my lord ?
- I must not contradict your lordship - but , if I may be believed , I have not run these thirty years !
Lord Ardville .
His stupidity is amazing !
[ aside . ]
You 'll tell all the county , I say , that Miss Dalton has rejected me ?
Litchburn .
If it is your lordship 's order .
Lord Ardville .
My order ?
Litchburn .
My lord ?
Lord Ardville .
What do you mean , Mr. Litchburn ?
Litchburn .
I mean nothing , I 'm sure , my lord !
Lord Ardville .
That I have often found !
You think , also , yourself , perhaps , that I have been playing the part of an old fool ?
- Hay ?
- Speak !
Litchburn .
I must not contradict your lordship .
Lord Ardville .
How , sir !
[ angrily . ]
Litchburn With your lordship 's permission , I 'll humbly take my leave .
Lord Ardville .
What now ?
What are you going for ?
Litchburn .
I am so at a loss how to answer , my lord Lord Ardville .
Suppose , then , you remain a few minutes without answering ?
Is that impossible to you , Mr. Litchburn ?
Litchburn .
I hope I sha 'n' t speak another word , my good lord .
Lord Ardville .
Very well .
Tell me , now , then , what they said about my nephew Valentine .
Litchburn .
They said he was a very good young Gentleman , indeed , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
They did ?
- And what else ?
17 Litchburn .
And that he was so surprisingly in love with Miss Hilaria but it was not today they said that , - it was yesterday - so surprisingly in love , that he took no natural pleasure , not even in his meals !
And what 's more the extraordinary still , hardly knew his bed time .
Lord Ardville .
So , so , so !
That 's settled , is it ?
And my brother is so weak as to give his consent ?
But I was confident that was the case .
Litchburn .
Dear Heart !
he 's making out the lord knows what that I 've never said a word of !
But I dare not interrupt him .
[ aside . ]
Lord Ardville .
I 'll pursue her , however , through some other channel , and yet disappoint them .
Litchburn .
I must not utter a syllable .
[ aside . ]
Lord Ardville .
What are you so silent for , Mr. Litchburn ?
Why do n't you speak ?
Litchburn .
I was only just going to think what to say , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
Did you gather nothing else ?
- speak honestly .
Litchburn .
No , indeed , my lord !
- except just this little daisie , that I took the liberty to pluck by the Park Gate , and put in my buttonhole .
Lord Ardville .
Who 's that sauntering this way ?
Litchburn .
The Porter told me Sir Archy Fineer was here , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
Miss Dalton 's Cousin !
Now would I forfeit my estate to know if any one has had the impertinence to hint to him that I put myself into the power of that little fool !
- which , however , I shall totally disclaim , - unless I appoint him my ambassador for opening a new treaty with her .
I 'll sound him .
[ aside . ]
Mr. Litchburn , if you have any engagement for this morning - Litchburn .
None at all , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
I wo n't impede your keeping it .
Litchburn .
I 've none to keep , if I may be believed , my lord !
Lord Ardville .
Why then keep that none !
- Good morning , sir .
Litchburn .
I believe he means I may go .
[ aside . ]
My lord [ bows ] - I am as glad to be off as a man that 's just out of the Pillory !
- except for the honour !
- [ aside .
Exit . ]
[ Lord Ardville walks apart .
Enter Sir Archy Fineer . ]
Sir Archy .
O , there parades my old spark !
- what a jaunty Philander ( 32 ) to sigh at the feet of a blooming young nymph !
If a man did but know , when he acts like a fool , how he looks like a fool , he would either hide himself , or grow wiser .
If I make this match , the coterie of Hilaria , - her opera Box , - her purse , occasionally - and her Table habitually , must be mine .
( 33 ) ` Twill be mighty convenient .
Yes , I 'll e ` en tie the noose for her .
[ aside . ]
My lord Ardville !
I am proud of this opportunity of paying you my respects .
What a superb place you have here !
Lord Ardville .
Your Servant , Sir Archy .
Sir Archy .
I have been charmed with your mansion , and in rapture with your grounds .
All is beauty , magnificence , attraction .
One thing alone I find incomplete : I see no fair Participator in the delights of your habitation .
Lord Ardville .
18 He has learnt the whole business already .
I can scarcely contain my rage .
[ aside . ]
Every one is the best judge , sir , of his own delights .
Sir Archy .
Yet every one must join in acknowledging that a lovely young female - Lord Ardville .
Have a care , sir !
Sir Archy .
My lord ?
Lord Ardville .
I am not easily amused with raillery , Sir Archy .
Sir Archy .
Pardon me , my lord  I meant none .
I had seriously imagined , from the sight of my fair young cousin under your lordship 's roof - Lord Ardville .
What would you insinuate , sir ?
Sir Archy .
Forgive me , my lord  't was , at least , a natural mistake  for who can see Beauty and Splendour meet , and not fancy they seem just adapted for each other ?
Lord Ardville .
If this is one of your sneers , Sir Archy - Sir Archy .
No , upon my word !
Related as I am to Miss Dalton , how could I help wishing her such an honourable establishment ?
Lord Ardville .
He is the very man for my embassy .
[ aside . ]
I perceive , Sir Archy - for you will not very often , I believe , find me guilty of misapprehension - you are fully apprized of this little - simple - anecdote : but before I enquire into the means of your information , permit me to ask , categorically , the use you wish to make of it ?
Sir Archy .
I would not , my lord , be officious , or impertinent  but I am impelled , equally by regard for my cousin , and respect for your lordship , to offer my poor services towards bringing this affair to a happier conclusion .
Lord Ardville .
You must conceive , Sir Archy , I am not a person to be trifled with , and your Cousin - Sir Archy .
Youthful inexperience , my lord , may sometimes stand in need of friendly counsel .
Lord Ardville .
You conclude her conduct , then , to be under some inimical influence ?
Sir Archy .
'T is impossible , otherwise , to account for what has happenned .
Lord Ardville .
I confess myself of that opinion , sir  and an error of judgement is not - precisely - the thing to which I am most liable .
Sir Archy .
Can your lordship wonder , then , at my solicitude to save an amiable young relation from repentance ?
Lord Ardville .
If you observe any symptoms of that , sir , I here endow you with full powers to renew to Miss Dalton the proposals I made her last night .
Sir Archy .
I am enchanted with the commission .
I will fly to her new habitation , which is not ten paces from this spot , and , in less than half an hour , I shall have the honour of waiting upon your lordship with the result of my enterprize .
Lord Ardville .
I shall expect you , sir .
Sir Archy .
I 'll make the match - and Hilaria shall keep me a pharo Table ( 34 ) in return .
[ aside .
Exit . ]
Lord Ardville .
My Brother and his family will now , I flatter myself , discover that I have the skill to execute what I have the sagacity to plan .
My calculations , I believe , will be found tolerably correct .
[ Exit . ]
19 [ Enter Mr. Litchburn , slowly . ]
Litchburn .
Now my good lord is gone on , I may come back , and go by the right way  for it 's quite the extraordinary , but I am always in such a dilemma when my lord 's by , that I am sure to go the direct contrary .
My poor legs ache prodigiously with waiting to get by .
[ Enter the Strange Man . ]
O , there 's the dodging man that my lord did me the honour to order me to get out of the way : and , to be sure , I am very proud to do what my lord , bids me - else , he looks so bluff , I had almost as lief be excused speaking to him .
However , my lord must be obeyed .
Pray , sir [ gently advancing to the Strange Man ] - Pray , sir , might I just take the liberty to ask an iota , or two , of what you may happen to want in this neighbourhood ?
Strange Man .
No .
Litchburn .
He speaks so unexpected , I feel almost as if he had knocked me down !
[ aside . ]
Will you favour me , then , sir , with a permit just to enquire what your business may be ?
Strange Man .
Yes .
Litchburn .
I am very much beholden to you , indeed , sir .
Pray , sir , what is it ?
Strange Man .
My own .
Litchburn .
Then perhaps , sir , it may be somewhat of the secret ?
Strange Man .
Perhaps it be .
Litchburn .
May be , then , sir , it may n't be agreeable to you to advise me of it ?
Strange Man .
Belike it be n't .
Litchburn .
I mean no harm , sir  only my lord has had the condescendsion to command me to say , that he is rather of the particular , in not being over complaisant about any Gentleman 's walking much at random just without his Park pales .
Strange Man .
Do n't a like it ?
Litchburn .
I am inclined to think not , sir .
Strange Man .
Why then let un ax 'em to walk within 'em .
Litchburn .
What , my lord ?
My lord ask such a thing of a stranger !
Strange Man .
If a do n't like a stranger , let a strike up an acquaintance .
If he be ready , so be I. Here 's my fist .
Litchburn .
Dear Heart !
your fist to my lord ?
- It 's pretty lucky his lordship does not hear you ... craving your pardon for the remark .
Strange Man .
` Tmought be luckier if a did .
Litchburn .
Luckier ?
Strange Man .
Ay  prove a wa 'n' t deaf .
[ Mr. Litchburn holds up his hands in amazement . ]
Does a bide all alone in that big house ?
Litchburn .
Yes  except when he has his good Brother there - or his niece - or his nephews - or - Strange Man .
Is not one Muster Wallentine ( 35 ) one of ` um ?
Litchburn .
I do n't extraordinary much like being queried by such a low companion .
- ( 36 ) Only it 's a moot point , if I affront him , but he tells me it 's a word 20  a blow !
And I should make but a puny hand at a boxing match .
I 'd better try a civil get off .
[ aside . ]
Sir , I hope you 'll favour me to excuse my not over-caring to stay in this sharp air , the wind being rather a detriment than otherwise to my Cough  for , last Thursday Evening , walking out pretty nigh upon twilight , I caught a great cold .
Good day , Sir .
[ Exit . ]
Strange Man .
Did ye ?
Make much o n't , then  it 's well to catch anything these hard times .
So Muster Wallentine - [ following . ]
Scene 3 [ An ordinary Parlour .
Enter Hilaria . ]
Hilaria .
How singular that Valentine should not hand me to the carriage !
Where could he possibly be ?
What a dismal place is this ?
[ looking round ] O London !
enchanting London !
when shall I behold thee again ?
If Valentine were not expected , I greatly fear - dearly as I love lord Exbury - I could hardly remain in this petrifying country spot another hour .
[ Enter Sir Archy Fineer . ]
Sir Archy !
I thought you were gone back to town ?
Sir Archy .
I have deferred my journey only for five minutes , in which small space of time you must answer me the following questions : will you be a Baroness ?
- or a Shepherdess ?
- order your carriages ?
Or feed your chickens ?
- Give a ball to half London ?
- or a dish of tea to the Curate 's wife , and five small children ?
Hilaria .
O , if you mean to speak again of that hideous old Peer - Sir Archy .
What matters his being hideous to a wife ?
Hilaria .
How ?
Sir Archy .
The honey-moon , indeed , may be somewhat less loving for it , but , that over , who , of any fashion , live enough together to care whether their mate be hideous , or adorable ?
Hilaria .
But he is so dreadfully haughty - Sir Archy .
You need desire no greater advantage .
Your youth and beauty will soon cast all his pride and ill-humour upon others  while , for yourself , with the smallest portion of address , you may contrive to have your pharo Table recruited ( 37 ) for every cross word .
Hilaria .
Pharo Table ?
Sir Archy .
Should you not like to keep one ?
Hilaria .
How can you teize one so !
- to be sure I should !
- Sir Archy .
Then he is just the thing for you : he is exactly framed to give the celebrity of Fashion to spirit and beauty - for where a woman cares for her husband - you hear of her no more .
Hilaria .
O fie , Sir Archy !
Sir Archy .
Take it , my fair Cousin , for a general rule , That where a lady is peculiarly famed for her entertainments to the world , she is not in high danger of envy for her conjugal bliss .
Hilaria .
Now how provoking that is !
And I really can not - just now - recollect many instances to contradict it .
Sir Archy .
And yet you fancy you shall do better to waste your prime in a lonely Village ?
Hilaria .
I am sure we shall be very ... comfortable .
Sir Archy .
For a week , or so , - in the dog days , to refresh 21 and clarify , the country is very well  but for a whole season - a year - two , three years - Hilaria .
I owe so much to Lord Exbury - Sir Archy .
To consume a whole life with sauntering in a Garden , - visiting a drowsy neighbour , - or coqueting with a wretched red Coat , ( 38 ) bound apprentice for three years to the nearest town ?
Hilaria .
Now do n't try to frighten me !
Sir Archy .
To be shut up , evening after evening , certain that not a soul will enter the house  - to see the same faces to day as yesterday ,  to-morrow as to day  - no relief from insipidity , - no escape from uniformity , - no awakening from sleep !
- Hilaria .
You are really cruel : yet I do n't shrink from your picture .
[ walking away . ]
Sir Archy .
No concert !
- no assembly !
- no ball !
- [ following her . ]
Hilaria .
Do be quiet !
- Sir Archy .
No Milliners !
Hilaria .
How you delight to torment !
Sir Archy .
And no better companion than that dawdling Miss Exbury !
Hilaria .
Yes , but the family - Sir Archy .
Mordaunt yawning of your party , only because he has not a Guinea to carry him elsewhere .
Hilaria .
Yes , - but still - the family - alltogether - Sir Archy .
Valentine , who alone might give some spirit to the tribe , shirking it - Hilaria .
How !
Sir Archy .
Did you think he would come to this dreary hovel ?
Hilaria .
Nay , why should he not ?
Sir Archy .
Very possibly he may have some business - some little engagement - in town .
Hilaria .
In Town ?
What ?
will he quit the Country just as we all - that is , just as his Father fixes his abode in it ?
Sir Archy .
He will , past doubt .
You may depend upon that .
Hilaria .
Is it possible !
- so fond as he seemed of domestic life !
so eager for a rural residence !
ah !
all men are alike !
Sir Archy .
Yes , where they have a point to carry .
Your good sense rendered his attempt upon you abortive ,  his own therefore , now shews him , that he may find full as good entertainment in London , as in peering through hedges in the country , for a peep at the high road that leads to it .
Hilaria .
How stupid the house will be !
I shall never bear it !
- That frivolous Miss Exbury - that Mordaunt - such utter retirement - it will be quite insupportable !
[ half apart ,  walking about . ]
Sir Archy .
She is struck at last !
[ aside . ]
Well , then , coz , I must tell Lord Ardvllle you wo n't hear of any settlements , however sumptuous ?
Hilaria .
What ?
22 Sir Archy .
That the thoughts of his equipages only fill you with disdain ?
Hilaria .
Ha ?
Sir Archy .
That pin-money is your aversion ?
Hilaria .
What are you talking about ?
Sir Archy .
That you hold nothing in such contempt as a title ?
Hilaria .
Pho !
Sir Archy .
And that a young Widow 's jointure ( 39 ) - and that living in London - and that a Box at the Opera - Hilaria .
O sir Archy !
- Sir Archy .
Are all things so detestable you can never endure to hear them mentioned ?
Hilaria .
A Box at the Opera !
- Do go , tormenter !
Sir Archy .
And this is the answer I am to take .
Hilaria .
If you insist upon carrying one of your own fabricating .
Sir Archy .
Will you help me to a softer one ?
Hilaria .
No !
- I can not !
[ sighing . ]
Sir Archy .
Will you suffer him to frame one for himself ?
Hilaria .
I do n't know what I shall do !
- I am quite - now do n't look so provoking !
Sir Archy .
He is waiting impatiently for your decision .
The crisis is come ,  it must be made .
Solitude and Morpheus - or the Opera and a Coronet !
( 40 ) Hilaria .
I 'll - I 'll send an answer tomorrow .
Sir Archy .
Come , come , you waver ?
- Take courage , sweet Coz , and receive my felicitations as Lady Ardville at once !
- I will fetch him !
- Hilaria .
O no , no !
- you terrify me !
Sir Archy .
I rejoice in the fair issue of my negociation !
- Adieu !
Hilaria .
Stay !
stay !
- keep him off , at least , as long as possible !
Sir Archy .
He shall not come till the evening .
Hilaria .
O no !
- not then !
- not so soon !
- Sir Archy .
I will defer my own journey back till tomorrow , and herald him hither to supper .
Hilaria .
But - but - understand me , now !
- I dont 't intend - I do n't mean - Sir Archy .
I understand your meaning , my lovely coz , better than you do yourself  but I can not wait another minute to talk about it .
- Hold - Miss Exbury !
- Hilaria .
Miss Exbury !
- ah !
quick let me escape her !
- O Valentine !
the die is cast !
- O Fashion - tyrant Fashion !
[ Exit , passing hastily by Miss Exbury . ]
[ Enter Miss Exbury . ]
Sir Archy .
The deer is fairly caught  and the best way to fix 23 the business , will be to proclaim it at once to all the family .
[ aside . ]
Miss Exbury .
Hilaria run away ?
- Is it to favour his declaration ?
How I wish I had put on something else !
I wonder how my hair - [ aside . ]
Sir Archy .
I have taken the earliest opportunity to pay you my devoirs in your new habitation .
I have just had a little discourse with my cousin Hilaria , to whom I have had the honour of presenting myself as ambassador from Lord Ardville .
Miss Exbury .
My uncle ?
- I suppose he has been asking his consent !
- [ aside . ]
Sir Archy .
You will pardon , therefore , the brevity of my visit , when you know that an expecting Lover waits his doom from my lips .
[ going . ]
Miss Exbury .
Lover ?
- what !
- how ?
- stay !
- whom do you talk of ?
Sir Archy .
His lordship , - Lord Ardville , - to whom I am carrying the news - That he is the happiest of Men .
She looks so confounded , that I fancy she expected to have been his heiress !
Poor thing !
I must say a soft word to console her .
[ aside . ]
Yes !
the happiest of men !
- while I. . .
am the most miserable !
[ Exit . ]
Miss Exbury .
What can this mean ?
Has Miss Dalton , at last , the perfidy to accept my uncle ?
And has my uncle the barbarity to let such an offer as Sir Archy 's want his support ?
The most miserable of men !
- Poor Sir Archy !
- But our mutual attachment shall prevail over every obstacle  - for , else , in this shabby dwelling , I may be an old maid before I have another offer .
O Mordaunt !
what have you not to answer for ?
I 'll go  load him with reproaches - though he 'll neither listen to , nor mind me !
He 's so vastly easy about every thing , that if we were all to faint away before him , he 'd never find it out - unless we fell over him !
END OF ACT II Act III Scene 1 [ The Country Landscape near Lord Ardville 's House and Park .
The Strange Man appears at a distance .
Enter Davis  Dawson . ]
Davis .
There he is !
There !
- Now if you 'll do me this little piece of service - Dawson .
To be sure I will  for though it goes against me to say it of myself , you may walk from one end of England to t ` other before you 'll find a man that will go beyond me for doing a good turn .
Davis .
Well , then , as Mrs. Innis sets such store by fortune-telling that she 'll hardly look at me now she 's heard of this young Gentleman if you 'll only get the fellow to make out it was I all the time he meant - Dawson .
You ?
- what , for the young Gentleman , He !
He !
Davis .
No , no , I do n't say that - but only that he - that is , that he did not mean any body !
That 's all .
So then he must begin all over again - so then he may make it appear - you see - that she has no real , true sweetheart - but me .
Dawson .
And do you think that in your conscience Mr. Davis ?
Davis .
Think it ?
I know it .
Dawson .
What ?
never another ?
Davis .
Never another worth having .
Dawson .
24 How I hate to hear a man brag of himself so !
I could not talk at such a rate for all the World  though I am just as certain as that I stand here , that there is not a person living would make her so good a husband as I should .
[ aside . ]
Davis .
I think I see her in that next field .
I 'll go and keep her off , till you can give the Conjuror his cue  and then , you shall march one way ,  I another , and when she comes home , we shall see how the spell has worked .
Dawson .
I 'll call him directly .
Davis .
And mind !
you must not name me  for that i 'n' t the way  you must only teach him to let her make me out by description , saying that I am so , -  so , -  so , -  such like   what 's most natural for her to guess me by .
Now - do n't set me off to a disadvantage , Mr. Dawson !
Dawson .
I should scorn it .
I 'll say every thing that 's genteelest .
Davis .
You 'll make me out cleverly , then , will you ?
like a friend ?
Dawson .
I 'll say nothing but what 's handsome .
Davis .
I depend upon you .
[ Exit . ]
Dawson .
Now that such an old Goose as that can think of such a young Chick as Mrs. Innis !
Such a conceit of himself is what I ca n't forgive .
To be sure I am not a school boy myself - but then , I dress in such a style -  have such a smartness ,  all that , about me - that if Mrs. Innis does not give me the preference , she must put her eyes in her pocket .
However , it 's not a bad thought about the Fortune-teller .
I 'll make him lend me a hand .
He may be of some use to me  but as to poor Davis , it could answer no end , for she 'll never think of such a common man as that .
Here !
You sir !
[ Enter the Strange Man . ]
How came you to talk to that young woman at our house about young Gentlemen ?
Strange Man .
Please your honour , it 's what they all likes to hear .
Dawson .
Well she 's coming this way now  so , do you see , stop her ,  tell her , 't was all a mistake .
Tell her it 's a Gentleman much more comely  likely than those that are younger , and one that 's very agreeable ,  affable , c.ever ,  - do you hear ?
- look !
one that dresses very handsome ,  wears powder in his hair - she 'll be sure that i 'n' t old Davis !
[ aside . ]
And knows how to take snuff - do you see ?
- and to poke his hands into his bosom - do you mind ?
- or to stuff them into his pockets , - do you take me ?
Strange Man .
Ay , ay , I takes your honour , I warrants me .
I 'll mark you out as like as two pots of ale one to t ` other .
Dawson .
Will you ?
there , then .
[ Gives him money . ]
You are sure you take notice ?
The height ?
- the air ?
- the features ?
- the Coat ?
-  all that ?
- [ turning about . ]
Strange Man .
Ay , ay , I sees well enough .
Dawson .
I believe this is the very first time in my life I ever spoke a good word for myself  but a low fellow , like that , could not know how to describe any thing of a Gentleman of his own accord -  if ever there was one that was not born one , - I must needs say I think I am he !
[ Exit . ]
Strange Man .
Does a b ` lieve I 'll sarve un , a ` ter drubbing me out of the house so this morning ?
A may go to old Nick first .
Ecod , now I 've touch'd the ready , ( 41 ) I 'll have a bit of fun of my own .
[ Enter Innis . ]
25 Innis .
O , there 's the fortune-teller .
Now I 'll try to get out of him who the young Gentleman is  for that it 's either Mr. Mordaunt or Mr. Valentine , is quite plain - unless , indeed , it 's Sir Archy Fineer .
[ taking out her purse . ]
I must cross his hand , ( 42 ) as they call it , first , I suppose .
[ Enter Davis . ]
Davis .
I can stand safe enough behind these trees ,  watch how she looks , when she discovers , by what 's said that it 's only her own old Davis all the time .
[ places himself behind a group of trees . ]
[ Enter Dawson . ]
Dawson .
I ca n't persuade myself to go away , till I know if the fortune-teller will speak handsomely enough to let her find out it 's me .
I sha 'n' t be observed by the side of this hedge .
[ places himself on the opposite side . ]
Innis .
Mr. Fortune-teller !
should you like to see another little bit of silver ?
Stange Man .
Mayhap I mought .
Innis .
There , then .
Now tell me something of this young Gentleman that 's to come after me .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Now for it !
Davis .
[ aside . ]
What will he begin with , I wonder !
Innis .
Pray ... What is his name ?
Strange Man .
What his father 's was afore un .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Right !
right !
I 'm glad he do n't name names .
Davis .
[ aside . ]
Very well , that !
a good come off .
Innis .
Pho , pho , - if you wo n't tell me his name , then , tell me his nature .
Describe him by signs , and let me find him out .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Now let 's hear !
Davis .
[ aside . ]
I hope Mr. Dawson 's tutored him to make me out cleverly .
Innis .
In the first place , what kind of a head piece ( 43 ) has he ?
Is he sensible ?
Strange Man .
Ay .
- a wont munch dry bread - when a can get meat to it .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Is that all ?
Davis .
[ aside . ]
That 's a cold compliment !
Innis .
Is he a brave fellow ?
has he courage ?
Strange Man .
Why yes , - a wo n't take a pull o ' the nose - without making a wry Face .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
What does he mean by that ?
Davis .
[ aside . ]
I do n't see much good this will do me .
Innis .
Is he agreeable ?
Strange Man .
A be : - a never gives a cross word - to himself .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
I ca n't make out what he 's after !
Davis .
[ aside . ]
I do n't over-much relish this !
Innis .
Well , and what sort of a Face has he ?
26 Strange Man .
A pure cheap one .
Innis .
A cheap one ?
Strange Man .
Ay  one that will hide dirt , and save soap  pretty nigh black of itself .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
D-l take the fellow , he ca n't have looked at me .
Davis .
[ aside . ]
Black ?
Why I was never thought blacker than my neighbours !
Innis .
And what are his Eyes ?
Strange Man .
Very loving ones .
Innis .
Loving ones ?
Strange Man .
Ay  they like hugely to star ( 44 ) one at t ` other .
Innis .
Why - what - does he squint ?
Strange Man .
Belike a does .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Squint !
what a scoundrel !
Davis .
[ aside . ]
Squint !
Well , I never knew it before !
Innis .
And what kind of a nose has he ?
Strange Man .
The true Pug .
Innis .
Why he 's a nasty fright , then ?
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
A pug nose !
what a rasca!l If I do n't believe I 've as handsome a nose as ever a man in England !
Davis .
[ aside . ]
My nose a pug ?
I believe he would be glad to have as good a one !
where did he get that into his head ?
Innis .
And how does he dress ?
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Now , then , now !
Strange Man .
Very vartuosly .
Innis .
Virtuously ?
How so ?
Strange Man .
Icod , in what not a Christian beside would touch with a pair of tongs .
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
This is the top of all !
- If I do n't drub him !
- Davis .
[ aside . ]
This is no better than downright back-biting .
Innis .
You give me such a bad account , that I 'll ask but one more question  what kind of figure has he ?
Strange Man .
Squat .
Innis .
Why then it can neither be Mr. Mordaunt , nor Mr. Valentine , nor Sir Archy Fineer neither !
Dawson .
[ aside . ]
Squat ?
I can bear it no longer .
I question if , in the king 's whole dominions , there 's a properer figure !
Davis [ aside . ] .
Squat ?
I ca n't keep my place !
- How a friend could give such a picture of me - [ They come softly from their hiding places , till both stop at the same moment ,  seize an arm of the Strange Man . ]
Dawson .
You 're a cheat and a rogue !
Davis .
27 Who put you upon saying I had a pug nose ?
Dawson .
What do you mean by calling me squat ?
- and saying I squint ?
Davis .
You ?
What have you to do with it ?
Strange Man .
Sauce for a Goose , is sauce for a Gander , your Honours .
But it was only a bit of a joke .
Innis .
O lud !
has it all been a joke ?
And will the young Gentleman come all one ?
Strange Man .
Ay , ay .
- If a do n't let it alone !
( 45 ) [ aside . ]
Davis [ quitting the Strange Man ,  going to the side of Innis . ] .
But I hope , Mrs. Innis , - Dawson [ quitting him also ,  going to her other side . ] .
But I think , Mrs. Innis - Innis .
Do n't hope , Mr. Davis - except that my good luck may prove true !
- And do n't think , Mr. Dawson - except of how glad it ought to make you :  then , if you are good old men ,  the young Gentleman appears , - perhaps I may let you both stand behind my chair at my wedding dinner .
[ Exit . ]
Davis .
Well , Mr. Dawson , I am much obliged to you , however , for saying every thing so handsome of me !
Dawson .
The fellow did not utter a word I bid him .
Davis .
Yes , yes , it was all of the genteelest sort !
Dawson .
Come hither , fellow , and let me get you tossed in a blanket this moment .
Strange Man .
I wonder you do n't !
[ walks sturdily off . ]
Dawson .
That rogue is no more of a fortune-teller than I am .
He has none of the manner of it .
Davis .
I 'll go after Mrs. Innis ,  tell her about the Ghost  if anything will bring her round , ` twill be the fright of that .
This fellow has set her up so on high , that I sha 'n' t , else , get a kind word from her these six Years - at least , not this day or two .
[ Exit . ]
Dawson .
Now I ca n't follow him , to make my own part good with her , for fear of my lord 's wanting me .
'T is the plague of my life , that all the rest of the servants are such a parcel of blockheads  for though 't is always my nature to under-value myself , I must be stark blind not to see that I am the only person in the whole house who can be called really clever .
[ Exit . ]
Scene 2 [ A dressing Room .
Mordaunt walking up  down .
Enter Miss Exbury . ]
Miss Exbury .
O Brother Mordaunt !
Mordaunt .
What ?
Miss Exbury .
How cruel is all this !
Mordaunt .
Is any thing the matter ?
Miss Exbury .
The matter ?
Good Heaven !
are we not all undone ?
Mordaunt .
What , you think the country rather amusing ?
( 46 ) Miss Exbury .
O Brother !
is this all the apology you make for bringing us to such a miserable place ?
Mordaunt .
Why what does it signify ?
28 Miss Exbury .
What signify ?
To vegetate in this pitiful hovel ?
to have no better drawing room than this half furnished old chamber ?
Not to know how to put any thing on - Mordaunt .
Nobody 'll see you .
Miss Exbury .
And do you think that a consolation ?
To be shut up from all amusements ?
not to know what any body does ?
not to see what any body wears ?
never to meet with any of ones friends - Mordaunt .
You 'll miss very few people .
Miss Exbury .
You are always so easy about ones misfortunes !
Do you know where Valentine is ?
My Father has seemed more unhappy at his so abruptly forsaking us than at all the rest .
Mordaunt .
Why what does he want with him ?
Miss Exbury .
I believe he depended upon him for every thing .
I am sadly afraid , Brother Mordaunt , he means to speak to you a little severely .
Mordaunt .
I think that likely enough .
Miss Exbury .
But how will your philosophy sustain hearing that Hilaria , at last , has consented to become Lady Ardville ?
Mordaunt .
Lady Ardville ?
That 's rather awkward , faith .
Miss Exbury .
Awkward ?
Is that all you have to say to such shocking intelligence ?
Why , if our expectations are over from my uncle , who 'll think of us any more ?
We shall be entirely forgotten .
Besides , how foolish it will make us look !
Mordaunt .
Not a soul will observe us .
Miss Exbury .
Only conceive her going about every where , in jewels  nabob muslins , ( 47 ) while I may be making pastry in a yard wide cotton , and you  Valentine be clipping Hedges in Carter 's frocks !
( 48 ) Mordaunt .
I sha 'n' t give my direction to a creature .
Miss Exbury .
La , Brother , if nobody see you , you care for nothing .
Mordaunt .
Why what is there to care for ?
Miss Exbury .
Well , I wonder , at least  you do n't care about your own waistcoat , for I never saw you in such an ugly thing before .
Mordaunt [ starting ] .
Ugly ?
What , my waistcoat ?
Miss Exbury .
And Sir Archy Fineer had on the most beautiful one in the World .
Mordaunt [ eagerly ] .
Had he ?
Do you know who 's make it is ?
Miss Exbury .
Did not you remark it ?
Mordaunt .
He had not taken off his great coat when I saw him .
But - what sort of cut ?
Miss Exbury .
I 'm sure I do n't know , but 't was amazingly pretty   yours - pardon me , - is the greatest fright I ever beheld .
I dare say Sir Archy would not be seen in it for a thousand pounds .
Mordaunt .
Do you think so ?
I 'll throw it to the dogs directly [ walks up  down , disturbed , looking at his waistcoat . ] .
Miss Exbury [ to herself ] .
Now how my Uncle can be so cruel - when my heart is so deeply engaged - as not to let me 29 know , all this time , what Sir Archy has said about the settlement ,  about the pin money !
[ Enter Innis . ]
Innis .
I beg pardon - I thought my young lady was with you , ma'am .
Now if it 's Mr. Mordaunt , I 'll watch well , and find him out .
[ aside . ]
Miss Exbury .
No , Mrs. Innis .
But what is the matter ?
You look fluttered .
Innis .
Any body would be fluttered , I believe , ma'am !
- I only just went out a little way , at my young lady 's desire , to see if there were any pretty walks near the House , and , just as I came back , I was joined by Mr. Davis , and he says - he says - Miss Exbury .
What does he say ?
Innis .
Do n't be frightened , ma'am !
- Miss Exbury .
At what ?
Innis .
Why he says - but , now , pray do n't mind it !
Miss Exbury .
Do tell what you mean ?
Innis .
Why he says , ma'am - that we 're all come to a haunted house !
Miss Exbury .
How ridiculous !
Mordaunt .
So you do n't think Sir Archy would wear this waistcoat ?
Miss Exbury .
Now I protest you dwell more upon that foolish waistcoat , than upon bringing us all into this barbarous disgrace !
But pray , Mrs. Innis , have you heard the news about your young lady ?
Innis [ simpering ] .
Y. .
e. .
s , ma'am - Mr. Davis was told it by Sir Archy himself , as he went away  so we had just a little chat about it , together .
No , I do n't think it 's Mr. Mordaunt .
He has not a bit the look of a lover .
I dare say it 's Mr. Valentine .
[ aside .
Exit . ]
[ Mordaunt walks apart . ]
Miss Exbury [ to herself ] .
The settlement ca n't be very bad , I think .
Let 's see  he has four thousand a year   he 'll have two thousand more when his mother dies -  she is very sickly .
And if his sister does not marry , there 's ten thousand to return to him at her death -  she looks very consumptive .
And if his younger Brother should die without Children , there 's another five thousand -  he was in a very bad way last spring .
O , it will certainly do !
I feel my regard for him encrease every moment .
- Besides , his uncle is so rich -  so fond of him -  every body thinks him in a decline - [ Enter Davis . ]
Davis [ to Mordaunt ] .
My lord desires , sir , - Miss Exbury .
O Davis , do tell us something of all this quantity of news .
What is it Sir Archy said to you ?
And what is this story about a Ghost ?
And does my Father know any thing yet of Valentine ?
Davis .
I am no great believer in Ghost stories myself , ma'am  but I was told , by the servants at Lord Ardville 's , that no less than seventy or eighty had been seen about this House  the grounds , six of which once appeared to old Mr. Litchburn - at least , one did .
Miss Exbury .
How disagreable !
Mordaunt .
Why you 're not so simple as to believe it ?
Miss Exbury .
O dear , no !
- And ... what did Sir Archy say ?
Davis .
That he was just ( 49 ) going to fetch my lord 30 Ardville to his intended Bride Miss Dalton .
Miss Exbury .
And does my Father know this new misfortune ?
Davis .
Yes , madam  I thought it my duty to tell my lord immediately .
Mordaunt .
An awkward business enough , that .
Davis .
He was surprised ,  , certainly , a good deal concerned  but lauk !
you might have taken him for a Merry Andrew , - or a Punch , ( 50 ) in comparison to what he was about t ` other thing .
Miss Exbury .
What other thing , Davis ?
Davis .
Mr. Valentine 's going so sudenly to London .
Miss Exbury .
To London ?
Davis .
We found , at last , he had left word with Mr. Dawson , that he should tell my lord he was sorry he could not attend him , but he was obliged to go to town .
Miss Exbury .
And without even taking leave !
O fie , Valentine !
Mordaunt .
What 's the use of taking leave ?
Davis .
I never saw my poor lord so much hurt before .
I thought I heard his heart-strings crack as I looked at him .
And his face turned all blue that is , a sort of a blue green .
But he has ordered me , sir , to request you would not be out of the way , for he wishes to speak with you , as soon as he has settled some business he has now at hand .
( 51 ) Mordaunt .
So I expected .
Davis .
Unless you prefer its being to-morrow morning .
Mordaunt .
O yes  by all means I prefer to-morrow morning .
Miss Exbury .
Are you not frightened , Brother ?
Mordaunt .
About the ghost ?
Miss Exbury .
No  about this interview with my Father ?
Mordaunt .
What should I be frightened at ?
Do you think he will whip me ?
Miss Exbury .
I do , indeed !
though not with a rod of birch !
Mordaunt .
Well , give me a call , Davis , when he is ready , lest I should forget it ,  be out of the way .
Davis .
Yes , sir .
And I 'd give a good five hundred pounds to prove you were not my dear lord 's son - a month 's wages , at least .
[ aside .
Exit . ]
Miss Exbury .
Forget it ?
would that be possible , when you know what dreadful things he must have to say to you ?
Mordaunt .
Nobody 'll hear them .
Miss Exbury .
O Brother !
- But what can I put on , now , if Sir Archy comes to night ?
I have nothing ready .
Mordaunt .
Keep your chamber , then .
[ yawning . ]
[ Enter Innis . ]
Innis .
O ma'am !
- my young lady 's walked out - and I have such a thing to tell her !
Miss Exbury .
What ?
what ?
Mrs. Innis ?
31 Mordaunt .
Ay , how many more Ghosts have you conjured up ?
Innis .
O Sir , do n't joke !
for it 's all true !
I have just heard all the whole particulars .
Miss Exbury .
What nonsence !
Innis .
I 'm sure , ma'am , I wish it were nonsence with all my heart , - but it 's a lady , ma'am !
Mordaunt .
A lady ?
O , then , nonsence , certainly , is out of the question !
Innis .
Yes , sir , a lady , that died in the very house we are now in !
Miss Exbury .
How shocking !
Mordaunt .
What , you imagined people in this house lived for ever , did you ?
Innis .
And she 's been seen walking in the very same cloaths she wore alive !
Miss Exbury .
How horrid !
Mordaunt .
You think , perhaps , she ought to have set you some new Fashion ?
Innis .
And there 's been such a screeching heard since , between whiles , through the key-holes - Mordaunt .
Every time the wind blew , I suppose ?
But you look pale sister ?
I really suspect you are afraid ?
Miss Exbury .
I ?
- no  - I should like to see a Ghost of all things .
I only wish Sir Archy would call , for this is just a story to divert him .
Innis .
I 'm sure , ma'am , I 'm glad you do n't mind it , for nobody so much as passes by the door , now , but o ' tip toe .
Miss Exbury .
What door , Mrs. Innis ?
Innis .
Why that door , ma'am - There !
- Miss Exbury .
What do you mean ?
That 's my apartment .
Innis .
It 's the Ghost 's room , ma'am !
[ whispering . ]
Miss Exbury .
The Ghost 's room ?
Innis .
Yes , ma'am , it 's there the Ghost appears .
Miss Exbury .
How absurd !
And where have you heard all this ?
Innis .
Mr. Dawson , ma'am , came over just now from Lord Ardville 's  he told it all himself , for he knows it from old Mr. Litchburn .
Miss Exbury .
How silly !
Send me the house keeper , however .
I 'll desire her to put a stop to such rumours .
Innis .
She 's been gone this hour  more , ma'am  for when she found we were crowded so bad , she gave us out all the things she had in her care , and went away , before any of us knew of the house being haunted , except Mr. Davis  and he was unpacking for my lord till after she was gone .
Miss Exbury .
I hope you do n't suppose I care about this idle tale , Brother Mordaunt , - but yet - I think - I was thinking - suppose you were to occupy that room , -  so let me have yours ?
- Will you , Brother ?
32 Mordaunt .
What , you are afraid of being taken for the Ghost yourself , are you ?
Well , let 's see what condition it 's in .
Innis .
O lud , sir !
You wo n't go there alone ?
Mordaunt .
Why not ?
What would you have me fear ?
A puff of wind ?
Or the flutter of a moth ?
Or a fly caught in some old cobweb ?
[ goes in . ]
Miss Exbury .
Mrs. Innis , come hither !
[ whispers ] Do n't think me frightened , for all this only makes me laugh - but I shall find some other room to sleep in  only take no notice of it  -  fetch out all my things yourself , unknown to any body .
Innis .
I ?
good lud , ma'am , how can you think to ask me such a thing ?
Miss Exbury [ peeping through the door ] .
Well , Brother ?
Mordaunt [ re-entering ] .
No  it 's worse accoutred than my own .
It wo n't do for me .
Miss Exbury .
O , it does not matter .
Mordaunt .
But , pray , what 's that closet locked for ?
Innis .
O sir , I hope you did not meddle with that closet ?
Mordaunt .
Why ?
Is it bewitched ?
Innis .
It 's there the Ghost is , Sir !
Mordaunt .
Let 's have a look at it , then .
Innis .
O no , sir !
stop !
stop !
- When the housekeeper agreed with Mr. Davis about the house , she said he could not have the use of that closet on account of something particular .
She owned to that herself !
but Mr. Davis , knowing nothing , then , about the Ghost , asked no questions .
And now , she has taken the key away with her .
Mordaunt .
Well , then , Mrs. Innis , since the Ghost is locked up , you 've nothing to fear .
Innis .
La , sir , a Ghost is not like to such a person as I !
Mordaunt .
That I 'll be sworn !
Innis .
I never heard to the contrary but what it could come as well through a key-hole as through an open door .
Mordaunt .
I wish Lord Ardville would have lent me a Horse .
I do n't know how to get on with the afternoon .
Miss Exbury .
O , if you were to ride out , Brother , I dare say you would meet with thousands of your acquaintance - all so curious  inquisitive !
Mordaunt .
My acquaintances ?
O the d -- l - I wo n't be seen by a soul .
- What shall I do ?
- Ca n't you help me , Mrs. Innis ?
Have you found out nothing in these parts good for the spleen ?
No Wake ?
no Pig-race ?
( 52 ) no fortune telling ?
no - Innis .
Fortune telling ?
- O yes , sir !
There 's a fortuneteller who keeps walking all about so , one ca n't stir but one meets him .
Mordaunt .
Is there so ?
I think I 'll try what that will do for me .
Miss Exbury .
Sure , Brother , you wo n't go out , now Papa may want to speak to you .
Mordaunt .
O , ay , true !
I did not recollect that .
I 'll take a nap , I think , then .
[ Exit . ]
33 Innis [ to herself ] .
No , no  it 's not Mr. Mordaunt .
A snow ball , or a lump of Ice , is just as like a lover as he is .
It must be Mr. Valentine .
That 's sure .
Miss Exbury .
Come , Mrs. Innis , quick !
- help out my things .
Innis .
Lud , ma'am !
Miss Exbury .
Make haste !
make haste !
Innis .
Why then , ma'am , will you go in first ?
- Miss Exbury .
Pho , pho - how can you be so silly ?
Innis .
And just give a little peep through the key-hole of that closet , to see if you can see any thing ?
Miss Exbury .
I ?
No , indeed !
- I do n't like to take so much trouble .
Innis [ looking in ] .
Dear ma'am - I do think I hear something moving !
Miss Exbury .
Where ?
- where ?
- Innis .
In that corner - yonder - Do pray , ma'am , step  see if it 's any thing .
Miss Exbury .
Not I , indeed !
I have no such silly curiosity .
[ retreating . ]
Go in , Mrs. Innis .
Innis .
O dear ma'am , what alone ?
Miss Exbury .
Why you 'll soon be back , you know .
Innis .
O dear , I could not for never so much !
Miss Exbury .
Pho , pho  I 'm close behind you - go in , I say .
Innis .
O dear me !
- [ peeping in ] Ah !
Miss Exbury .
What 's the matter ?
- Do you hear any thing ?
Innis .
I thought I did , I 'm sure !
- such an odd sort of rustling !
- something just like I do n't know what !
Miss Exbury .
Nonsence !
Come , let 's go in , and bring away the things together .
[ They go in .
A loud screaming is heard from the inner Room .
Re-enter Miss Exbury , running ,  holding up her hands . ]
How frightful !
How horrid !
[ Exit . ]
[ Re-enter Innis , who stumbles in passing the door . ]
Innis .
O ma'am !
- O stay , stay for me !
- The Ghost is at my heels !
A Voice Within .
Innis !
Innis .
O , it knows me !
- O mercy !
- [ kneels . ]
Voice Within .
Innis !
Innis .
O !
it calls me !
- I 'm dead !
[ falls on her Face . ]
[ Enter Valentine , softly . ]
Valentine .
What is all this ?
Why do you lie there ?
Innis .
No offence , I hope !
- I dare not lift up my head !
- no offence , I hope !
Valentine .
Offence ?
I am all amazement !
Innis [ fearfully looking up ] .
La !
if it is not just like to the shade of Mr. Valentine !
34 Valentine .
The shade ?
Innis .
Lud !
it 's the very sound of his voice !
Valentine .
The sound ?
What do you mean ?
Innis .
Good la !
in his very cloaths !
Valentine .
In my very cloaths ?
- would you have me in yours ?
Innis .
I ca n't believe my eyes !
A 'n' t you the Ghost , then , sir ?
Valentine .
A Ghost ?
- No , I thank you !
Innis [ rising ] .
What !
are you the right real Mr. Valentine all this time ?
How glad I am !
I thought as much as could be you were the Ghost !
Valentine .
My dear Innis !
what folly is this ?
Innis .
Folly , sir ?
why then what did you come out of that Ghost 's place for ?
Valentine .
Ghost 's place ?
- Are you crazy ?
Innis .
I 'm sure , sir , I do n't know what I am : and your sister is worse .
- Perhaps he has only hid himself here on purpose to speak to me !
I 'm all in a quake !
[ aside . ]
Davis [ without ] .
Mrs. Innis !
Innis .
Hark !
- somebody calls !
- If that should be the right Ghost !
Davis [ without ] .
Innis !
Mrs. Innis !
Innis .
No  it 's only Mr. Davis .
Valentine [ fastening the door ] .
No one must enter .
Innis .
La , Sir , what do you mean ?
Do n't fright me !
- O yes !
it 's Mr. Valentine !
it 's Mr. Valentine !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
Move softly .
No one must know I am here .
Innis .
La , Sir , do n't lock me in with only you  the Ghost !
- Yes !
he 's going to speak !
[ aside . ]
Davis [ without ] .
Mrs. Innis !
ca n't you slip out ?
Innis .
Yes , Mr. Davis , only - Valentine .
Do n't answer !
do n't utter a word !
stay till I am concealed .
Davis [ without ] .
Mrs. Innis , I say !
- The Door is fastened !
Valentine [ in a hurried manner ] .
My dear Innis , the most urgent necessity impels my present conduct .
It must not be known I am here .
I intended only to speak to my sister  - but my enquiries can be answered by yourself .
[ A great clamour at the door , and call of Mrs. Innis , Mrs. Innis . ]
Get rid of these people as quickly as possible , without any explanation  and then let me see you one minute alone  and if you would ensure me your firm , unalterable friend for life - utter not my name !
I shall be bound to you for-ever !
[ puts a purse into her hand ,  glides into the inner room . ]
Innis .
I am all in such a twitter , I might be knocked down with a feather !
- Bound to me for-ever !
Yes !
it 's Mr. Valentine is the man !
How those fortune-telling people do know every thing !
But I wo n't let Mr. Davis into the secret , till I am sure he means honourable .
What a generous Gentleman he is !
A firm friend 's a very good thing indeed !
[ looking at her purse ,  putting it up .
A clamour again at the door .
She opens it . ]
35 [ Enter Davis . ]
Davis [ stopping at the door ] .
My dear Mrs. Innis !
- what has been the matter ?
I am in such a sweat !
- You know I do n't believe in Ghosts - but if this lady really walks - Are you quite sure you are alone ?
- [ looking cautiously round as he advances . ]
Innis .
I do n't know what I am , indeed , Mr. Davis .
Davis [ in a low voice ] .
Have you seen any thing ?
Innis .
Yes , I have Mr. Davis !
Davis .
Good lauk !
then it 's true !
- And pray - is it vanished away ?
- or do you see something now , invisible ?
Innis .
I must not tell , Mr. Davis !
Davis .
What a thing that ever I should have taken such a house as this !
But I never supposed it was for ourselves .
The Groom ,  both the new maids came up with me , to try to get you out  but they jumped so , as soon as the door began opening , that they all tumbled down stairs .
We were sure there was a voice !
Innis .
That there was , indeed , Mr. Davis !
Davis .
Good lauk !
- This is come upon me as a judgement , for my scoffing at poor Mr. Litchburn so for his fears !
- which I will never do any more  - no , not if I should catch him again , as I did this morning , bowing to Lord Ardville 's shadow , for fear the substance should turn round , and see him standing up , like a Man !
- Miss Exbury is so frightened !
She wanted my lord to come  but he said he must not be disturbed till he had finished his Letters .
She asked Mr. Mordaunt , too  but he said he was sleepy , and must take his nap first : and your young lady , Miss Dalton , is not returned from her walk yet .
Innis .
You must not stay , Mr. Davis !
Davis .
Why not ?
Innis .
I ca n't tell !
[ Shaking her head . ]
Davis .
But why ?
Innis .
Because I do n't know , Mr. Davis !
But you must not stay !
Davis .
Surely you are not bound over to secrecy ?
Innis .
Yes , I am , Mr. Davis .
Davis .
That 's surprising indeed !
- But how came you to fasten the door ?
Innis .
It was not I fastened the door , Mr. Davis !
Davis .
Good lauk !
why - did the Ghost lock you up with it ?
Innis .
You must not ask , Mr. Davis !
Davis .
Why you wo n't stay to be all alone with it again ?
- Why do you shake your head ?
- Do you motion me away ?
- What do you put your finger on your lips for ?
- Must not you speak ?
- Good lauk !
- Tell me , at least , you do n't think any more about what the Fortuneteller said of a young Gentleman ?
Innis [ hiding a laugh ] .
N. . .
o , not much !
- but if you do n't make haste , Mr. Davis - presently you 'll see something appear !
Davis .
O lord !
[ hurries out . ]
36 Innis .
I never thought to have so much courage , I 'm sure .
But Mr. Valentine 's such a generous Gentleman - one would do any thing for a firm friend !
- [ calls softly at the door . ]
Mr. Valentine !
- Not think of the Fortune-teller ?
O to be sure !
why I think of nothing else .
[ Enter Valentine . ]
Valentine .
You oblige me for-ever , my dear Innis .
I will not detain you two minutes .
I have only to ask - I have only a small enquiry - a single word - Innis .
It 's all coming out now !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
In the haste with which I quitted my uncle 's house this morning , I left some papers behind me of so much consequence , that I was forced to ride ten miles back for them : and , upon reentering the hall , I heard - I was told - Dawson said - that your young lady - that my Uncle Ardville - but I can never , never believe it !
- Innis .
Poor Gentleman !
he has been crossed in his first love-but he sha 'n' t be in his second !
I was afraid it would vex you , sir .
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
How ?
- Is it true ?
- Perdition !
- Innis .
Sir !
Valentine .
May all that is most horrible - Innis .
You fright me , sir !
Valentine .
Do I ?
- I frighten myself !
- but I have been surprised - I have no right , however - yet , in such an exquisite machine , can a mercenary Soul be lodged ?
Can sordid depravity lurk in such a guise ?
- Innis , is it not possible there may yet be some mistake ?
Innis .
I am afraid there is , sir !
- I 'm sure I ca n't tell what to think , between one thing  t ` other !
Valentine .
I perplex you - but no more .
- Yet , you can be no stranger - Innis .
So it i 'n' t him , at last !
- But it do n't signify , for I dare say it 's Sir Archy Fineer [ aside . ]
- Why no , sir , we 're none of us no great strangers to your liking to my young lady .
Valentine .
I have been a fool - and my folly meets its merited reward .
Mrs. Innis , good evening to you .
You will not mention - but that I can not expect - I send , however , no felicitations , - I am not so false !
- It were profanation to congratulate her upon ( 53 ) such nuptials !
Innis .
Pray , sir , do n't speak so loud , for fear they 'll come to see if the Ghost 's doing me a mischief !
Valentine .
Ghost ?
- I talk wildly , indeed - But you 'll excuse me .
Good Evening .
Innis .
Stay , sir , one bit of a minute , and just let me ask if you 're sure you locked the door of the closet when you come out of it ?
Valentine .
What closet ?
Innis .
The Ghost 's closet , sir .
Valentine .
What absurdity is this !
I came out of no closet .
Innis .
No ?
what , do n't you know nothing about the Ghost , then ?
Valentine .
I came through the Garden , and up some back stairs , which were shewn me by Mr. Litchburn , whom I knew to have been a frequent visitor of the former inhabitants of this House .
37 Innis .
Good la !
why then you ca n't tell what may be in that closet all this time no more than I can ?
Valentine .
I conjure you , Innis , that my appearing here this evening , may not reach the ears of my Father .
That is all I require from you .
To every thing else I am wholly indifferent .
- O Heartless Hilaria !
- [ Exit by the inner door . ]
Innis .
'T is Sir Archy Fineer , as sure as a Gun !
- Poor Mr. Valentine !
't is none of him .
And he 's so sorrowful , I could almost find in my heart to give him back his Purse .
And so I will , too , for I shall have plenty , now , from Sir Archy .
Mr. Valentine !
- Mr. Valentine !
- [ calling softly . ]
- And yet , he 's so unhappy , he wo n't know how to spend it .
` Twill be pity to throw it away , without nobody 's enjoyment from it .
- I 'll run , for he 's coming back !
[ Exit . ]
[ Re-enter Valentine , cautiously . ]
Valentine .
Mrs. Innis !
- Mrs. Innis !
- Did you call ?
- I am sorry she 's gone .
She will certainly repeat my ravings to Hilaria , who may suppose me only hurt lest my Uncle , for her sake , should disinherit us .
Intolerable !
- I must see her ,  explain myself .
I will watch for her here , and take my last farewell .
A choice so obviously mercenary renders her unworthy even of regret .
Had I sought to beguile her into poverty for the gratification of my own passion - she had done well to plead our want of fortune : but no  competence was ours , if moderation bounded our desires .
It is to the vanities , not the comforts of life that she aspires .
She is the slave of Fashion -  I , a plain , but feeling man , am happy to have escaped her .
- Happy , said I ?
- O !
heartless Hilaria !
[ Exit , as before . ]
[ Enter Hilaria . ]
Hilaria .
Miss Exbury ?
- where can she be gone ?
I am glad , however , she is not here , that I may enjoy , a little longer , the delicious calm with which this charming walk has tranquilised my spirits .
That lane was so romantic - those meadows were so beautiful - that pretty simple Cottage - those interesting children - And is this the retired residence , this the country life I have so much dreaded ?
What a fool I have been !
I have judged it by stately dwellings , where luxury satiates the very wishes , and a superfluity of domestics makes even the use of our limbs unnecessary .
But this view of Nature in its wild variety , this intercourse with Cottagers , this charm of rural Liberty - I never even dreamt of it , till this my first stroll in paths unknown to equipage .
Heaven keep me from repentance !
- I think I hear some sound in that next room - Miss Exbury !
[ looking in . ]
- Heavens !
- a man ?
- Ah !
- Valentine !
- I die !
- [ Enter Valentine . ]
Valentine .
Pardon , madam , this uncalled , unauthorised intrusion .
The fear of misrepresentation - you look alarmed ?
Hilaria .
I - I - I - no , I am not - only - a little astonished .
Valentine .
You tremble ?
You can not imagine I had the presumption to mean to utter a reproach ?
Hilaria .
No  - I only imagined - that is , I thought - that - that - you were returned to town .
Valentine .
I am going , madam , immediately .
Be not impatient of this little minute .
Hilaria .
Did I say I was impatient ?
- But I have been so extremely - so inexpressibly - Lord Exbury , I would say , has been so much surprised at missing you so suddenly - but surprised is no word - disappointed - afflicted - Valentine .
My honoured Father !
- Ah , Miss Dalton , deign an instant , all occupied as you are with gayer subjects ,  newer views , to speak to me of my Father !
38 Hilaria .
Could he help being hurt that you deserted him ?
Valentine .
Deserted him ?
Heavens !
is it so he interprets my non-appearance ?
Does he so completely give me up ?
Deem me an alien to his blood ,  undeserving it should flow in my veins ?
- And you - have you thought so too ?
- Tell , tell me !
Hilaria .
I do n't know what to tell you !
I can recollect nothing  I hardly know if I am awake !
- Valentine .
How I came hither , which , perhaps , thus amazes you , Mrs. Innis can relate  - why I came - I had better forget myself !
- some step approaches - I must begone .
You will have the goodness to avoid mentioning that I have been here .
Circumstances the most cruel force me from the sight of my Father , whom I can fly - but never deceive .
Adieu , madam , - adieu !
[ going . ]
Hilaria [ gently ] .
Valentine !
Valentine [ returning ] .
Hilaria !
Davis [ from the outer door ] .
May I make bold to ask if Miss Dalton be in that room ?
Valentine [ retreating ] .
How barbarous !
Hilaria [ running to the door ] .
Fly !
I will keep them all without , till you are safe .
[ She goes out , pulling the door after her . ]
Valentine .
How kind in her cruelty !
And is such a creature made for so base a prostitution of all faith , all sincerity ?
ah !
she wants thought more than heart !
She is plunging into a gulph of which she sees not the depth .
What if I try - though hopeless , alas , for myself !
- to rescue her from such false vows ?
such worthless ambition ?
such contemptible motives of choice ?
Litchburn can easily let me sleep at his house to night , and conduct me hither , by that private entrance , tomorrow morning .
I will make the attempt .
Yes !
ere I see thee consigned to age , to avarice  to regret , I will probe thee , Hilaria , till I pierce thee to the soul !
[ Exit through the inner room . ]
[ Re-enter Hilaria , slowly  Davis peeping behind her . ]
Hilaria [ looking into the inner room ] .
He is quite gone !
- quite !
- what a terrible encounter !
O Valentine !
where , now , are my tranquilised spirits ?
Innis [ at the door ] .
Ma'am !
- ma'am !
- may I come in ?
Hilaria .
Yes .
[ Enter Innis . ]
Innis .
I 've been so frightened for you , ma'am !
Mr. Davis said he was sure he heard a voice   I was so afeard to venture , not knowing if it were the real Ghost itself , or only Mr. Valentine .
Hilaria .
Mr. Valentine ?
- What made you think of Mr. Valentine ?
Innis .
Why , ma'am , since you 've been gone - [ Enter Davis . ]
Davis .
My lord Ardville ,  Sir Archy Fineer , ma'am .
Hilaria .
Good Heaven !
Innis [ aside ] .
Sir Archy Fineer !
O lud !
I dare say the Fortuneteller has set him upon coming !
Davis .
Shall I shew his lordship up here , ma'am ?
Hilaria .
Not for the world !
Davis .
Am I to say you will come down , ma'am ?
39 Hilaria .
Not for the universe !
Davis .
What am I to do , ma'am ?
Hilaria .
Nothing .
Davis .
His lordship is standing in the little passage , ma'am .
Hilaria .
Then why do n't you tell Lord Exbury ?
Davis [ aside ] .
If I do n't think the Ghost has turned her head !
[ Exit , looking amazed . ]
Innis .
La , ma'am , - Hilaria [ disturbed ] .
Do n't talk to me !
[ Innis retires to a distance . ]
What a situation am I in !
O Valentine !
what a conflict have you once more raised in my Breast !
O Love !
O powerful Love !
- O Fashion !
- hateful Fashion !
[ Enter Sir Archy Fineer . ]
Sir Archy .
My dear Miss Dalton , what strange mistake is this ?
Davis says you desired Lord Ardville might be shewn to his Brother  have you forgotten their quarrel ?
Hilaria [ with affected ease ] .
Yes , I hate to think of quarrels .
Besides , if he ca n't see his Brother , what brings him to his house ?
Sir Archy .
Your own appointment .
Hilaria .
But so late ?
I am just asleep .
Sir Archy .
My dear cousin !
at eight o'clock ?
Hilaria .
O , all your watches go wrong .
I am quite drowsy .
[ yawning . ]
Sir Archy .
Amazing !
What am I to say to him ?
Hilaria .
What you will .
Sir Archy .
And what is he to think ?
Hilaria .
What he pleases .
Sir Archy .
And what will the family - what will the world report ?
Hilaria .
What it likes .
Sir Archy .
If you are so very easy , cousin , pardon me if I bring him up stairs , to hear his answer from yourself .
[ going . ]
Hilaria .
O cruel !
O horrid !
- Dear Sir Archy !
spare me but now - and to-morrow arrange what you will .
Sir Archy .
To that condition I agree .
I will tell him you are suddenly indisposed , but invite him to breakfast with you to-morrow morning : and , that no time may be lost , I shall charge him to write himself to his Lawyer to night - before he is - [ mocking her ] drowsy !
[ Exit . ]
Hilaria .
O no !
O stop , barbarian !
- he 's gone !
- Innis .
I do n't know what to make of it yet .
He hardly gave me a look .
[ aside . ]
- Pray , ma'am , - Hilaria .
Do n't say a word to me !
- Do n't follow me about !
- What a wretched barter have I made !
my whole self , my free existence , for wealth  vanity thus encumbered !
How my heart throbs  sinks alternately !
- Alas !
that I should scarcely suspect I had one , till the instant of selling for-ever its dearest natural rights !
[ Exit . ]
40 Innis .
Well , if ever - sending off one 's lover in such a manner as that , when he 's a lord !
I sha n't send off mine so , if he proves a true one , though he 's only a Baronight .
( 54 ) Nor I had not need , for if she goes on at this rate , I may look long enough before I get such another firm friend as this !
[ taking out her purse . ]
O lud !
- Sir Archy !
- Now then !
- Now for it !
[ putting it up again . ]
[ Enter Sir Archy Fineer . ]
Sir Archy .
In good truth , my fair cousin - How ?
Gone ?
Mrs. Innis , which way is your young lady ?
Innis .
He 'll out with it now !
( 55 ) [ aside . ]
She went to her own room , I fancy , sir .
Sir Archy .
Tell her - Innis .
I dare not , Sir !
Sir Archy .
Dare not what ?
Innis .
Tell her about - I am sure , sir , I do n't know myself , yet !
- but only she ordered me not to follow her quite premterring .
( 56 ) Sir Archy .
No matter  I must speak to her .
Go and say so , I beg , sweet Mrs. Innis .
Innis .
Yes , sir .
He 's a mighty pretty spoken man , for a Gentleman .
But I wonder he should send me away , when he might as easily open his mind to me .
Love makes us sad fools !
[ aside .
Exit . ]
Sir Archy .
If my noble old innamorato be again denied , the Game is lost .
I strongly suspect some secret hankering after that romantic Boy Valentine .
[ Re-enter Innis . ]
Innis .
Sir , my young lady 's sent me back quite out of sorts .
She says she 's laid down with a bad headache , and ca n't see a single soul till tomorrow morning , at no rate .
Sir Archy .
So !
so !
so !
she 's qualmish .
[ aside . ]
I must have a little talk with her .
What time does she usually rise , Mrs. Innis ?
Innis .
Very early , since we have been in the country , sir .
Perhaps he wants to speak to me before she is stirring !
[ aside . ]
Sir Archy .
How can I contrive to be the first person she sees in the morning ?
Have you never a spare room ?
Innis .
Dear Sir , no !
not so much as a closet .
They are all crammed full - [ pointing , and lowering her voice ] except just that one that the Ghost 's got .
Sir Archy .
The Ghost ?
Do you believe in Ghosts , Mrs. Innis ?
Innis .
O no , sir !
only it 's a little shocking , you know , sir , hearing of such things .
Sir Archy .
And what room is this haunted one ?
Innis .
Nobody 's , sir .
Miss Exbury has ordered the bed to be moved to where Mr. Valentine was to have been , and all her cloaths to be carried away , for fear of something 's coming out of that closet in the night .
- Not that she believes at all in Ghosts .
Only it 's a little horrid , you know , being so near , in case of any things happening .
Sir Archy .
If it 's unoccupied , it will just do for me .
[ entering the inner room . ]
Innis .
How adventuresome he is !
Sir Archy [ returning ] .
It 's a mighty good chamber .
I can pass the night 41 admirably upon that sopha .
For I shall probably quit my lord Ardville too late to make it worth while to undress , as I wish to rise so early .
- You have no room for my servant ?
Innis .
Not a corner Cupboard , if he were no bigger than a slop bason !
But what will you do if any thing should appear ?
Sir Archy .
Dance a rigadoon with it to your apartment .
Innis .
Oh !
- Sir Archy .
Well , call me in the morning , the instant your lady is awake , and I will keep the Ghost to myself .
I will step and ask leave of Lord Exbury - though he will wish me at the very devil for my interference - but a man of spirit is wished there so often , 't is no great matter .
[ aside . ]
You wo n't fail me , pretty Innis ?
[ putting money into her hand . ]
[ Exit . ]
Innis .
Yes , yes !
he has a mind to speak to me by myself in the morning !
'T is as plain as can be !
That 's a dear Fortune-teller !
- though if he do n't mean honourable , I 'll sooner take up with old Mr. Davis .
These marrying times with young ladies are very gay .
- They bring one in a heap of firm Friends !
[ Exit , looking at the two Purses . ]
END OF ACT III Act IV Scene 1 [ A dark Chamber , in which the door of a closet is just distinguished .
Sir Archy Fineer is discovered Iying on a sopha . ]
Sir Archy [ trying to look at his Watch ] .
Now what the devil is it o'clock ?
I have fastened the shutters so closely , for fear of some trick , that I can not make out the hour .
But the Ghost , according to custom , reserves its favours for those who fly them .
'T is so dark , I 'll e ` en venture to take another nap .
[ lies down .
A rustling noise within the wainscoat . ]
What 's that ?
[ lifting up his head . ]
Is it Innis ?
- No  't is in an opposite direction from the door - Again ?
- Why what the deuce - Valentine [ opening a door of which there was no outward mark . ]
The room has been darkened .
How unlucky !
I ca n't see my way .
[ to himself ] .
Sir Archy .
There is somebody stirring , past doubt .
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
How shall I get at Innis ?
[ to himself . ]
Sir Archy .
The d -- l !
Somebody 's come into the room !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
Or if I could find my Sister - [ to himself . ]
Sir Archy .
I hear a footstep distinctly !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
I ca n't make out where the door is !
[ to himself , and groping about . ]
Sir Archy .
This is no fancy !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
I think I hear something like breathing !
[ listens ] Perhaps 't is the pretended Ghost !
[ to himself . ]
Sir Archy .
Is this some theif , now ?
or a sweetheart of the fair Innis , in the disguise of a spectre ?
I wish I had my Pistols !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
I should like to devellop this fraud .
I 'll get my stick .
[ to himself  goes back by the private door . ]
[ A tap at the outer door . ]
Sir Archy .
What 's that , now ?
That 's still another sound !
Are there two of these Goblins ?
42 Davis [ without ] .
Sir !
Sir Archy .
Who calls ?
Davis [ without ] .
Davis , Sir .
Sir Archy .
I am heartily glad .
Open the door and come in , Mr. Davis .
[ Enter Davis , but no farther than the door . ]
Davis .
I have only stept up to call you , Sir , because Mrs. Innis - Sir Archy [ rising ] .
Come in , come in , Mr. Davis , and open the door wide , to give some light .
[ draws him in . ]
Do you know , Mr. Davis , somebody has certainly got into the room ?
Davis .
O lord !
[ hastening to the door , to get out , runs against it , and shuts himself in . ]
I 'm a dead man !
The door 's shut upon me !
Sir Archy .
Hark !
the sound came that way .
Do n't speak !
Davis .
I wo n't , sir , indeed !
only , for mercy 's sake , let me out !
Sir Archy .
Hush !
I hear it again !
Davis .
O lord !
[ Re-enter Valentine , with a Stick . ]
Valentine .
Some infamous imposition is afloat , I have no doubt , and if , unknown myself , I can detect , or frighten its author - Sir Archy .
Do n't fetch your breath so hard , Davis  somebody is certainly advancing !
[ in a whisper . ]
Davis .
Oh !
oh !
[ shaking . ]
Valentine .
That 's a groan , meant to terrify the house , I suppose .
What knavery !
But I 'll try who will shrink first .
Who are you ?
What do you do here ?
[ in a feigned  hoarse voice . ]
Davis [ to himself ] .
O lord !
't is the lady that walks !
Sir Archy .
'T is some cursed ruffian by the voice !
I do n't much like my situation !
[ to himself ,  retreating . ]
Valentine .
Answer !
by what right or title are you in this house ?
[ in the same voice . ]
Davis [ trembling ] .
None , honourable lady !
I 'll go out of it directly .
Valentine .
Lady ?
I am glad he thinks my voice so delicate .
[ aside ] For what evil purpose , then , have you entered it ?
[ in the feigned voice . ]
Davis .
I humbly crave pardon , ( 57 ) but I knew nothing of your ladyship 's walking !
Valentine .
Walking ?
What does the booby mean ?
would he have me come into the room on horse-back ?
[ aside . ]
Out !
out , I say !
Why are you not gone ?
[ in the feigned voice . ]
Davis .
I ca n't find the way , madam !
Valentine .
Would you have me find a way for you ?
[ in the same voice . ]
Davis .
O lord , no !
Sir Archy .
What an impudent rascal this must be .
[ aside . ]
43 Valentine .
If ever you dare play any more of your tricks in this house ... [ in the feigned voice . ]
Davis .
I never will , indeed , honourable madam !
- O , where 's the door ?
[ groping about . ]
Sir Archy .
I wish I had a blunderbuss , with all my heart !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
Or ever dare appear in it again to the last hour of your life ... Davis .
O , I 've found the door !
I 'm as glad as if it were the twenty thousand pound prize in the lottery !
( 58 ) [ opens it ,  runs out , pulling it after him . ]
Valentine .
Expect the condign punishment you merit !
[ in a still deeper voice ,  brandishing his Stick , but retreating behind the door , while it is open . ]
Sir Archy .
What a complete knave !
If I were sure he had no weapon  I 'd throttle him !
[ aside  advancing , receives a stroke from the brandishing stick . ]
The devil !
- This is the most substantial sort of a spectre !
- [ to himself . ]
Valentine .
So !
so !
so !
do Ghosts come in Pairs here ?
I have not cleared the coast yet  but if a little wholesome discipline will do it - [ to himself ,  feeling about with his stick . ]
Sir Archy [ gliding closely to the wall , to avoid it ] .
My blood boils to take him by the Collar !
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
'T is a species of imposter for which I have no mercy .
[ aside . ]
Voices Without .
Sir Archy !
Sir Archy !
Sir Archy Fineer !
Valentine .
Sir Archy Fineer ?
Heavens !
- let me make my escape !
[ aside ,  glides away by the private door , which he closes , as the other is thrown open from without . ]
Sir Archy .
Come in , come in !
- Bring lights !
The Same Voices .
We dare not come in !
Innis [ without ] .
We are afraid you have got the Ghost with you !
Sir Archy .
Be sure keep guard that no one slip past you ( 59 ) through the door .
Some villain is parading the chamber with a bludgeon  but I shall soon seize him now .
- What can this mean ?
[ looking round ] Here 's nobody !
Innis [ coming gently in ] .
Are you sure of that , sir ?
Poor Mr. Davis is quite in a transe  and the new servants have run down , and say they 'll all give warning .
Sir Archy .
Which way could he get out ?
Innis .
Which way ?
Good la , sir !
- Why how should a Ghost vanish , but vanish , you know , sir ?
Sir Archy .
I see no issue , no door - except this closet .
Innis .
But that 's the very place , sir !
[ whispering . ]
Sir Archy .
It is , is it ?
I 'll break it open this very moment , then .
Innis .
O lud , how can you be so wicked ?
[ running away . ]
Sir Archy .
'T is but one of her lovers , I 'll be sworn .
I wo n't derange him .
The golden rule for-ever !
[ aside . ]
Stay !
stay !
- Is your young lady up yet ?
Innis .
Up ?
yes , sir   gone out .
Sir Archy .
44 Gone out ?
Why did not you tell me ?
Innis .
She would not let me , sir .
Sir Archy .
And what 's to be said to Lord Ardville ?
Innis .
My young lady only bid me tell him she was walked out in the fields .
Sir Archy .
And is this the breakfast she has prepared for him ?
A little torment !
- I must fly  stop the old celadon ( 60 ) from approaching , till I can catch her for a few more of my worldly lessons .
[ aside . ]
Be sure tell my adventure to Lord Exbury ,  let this room be well examined .
Tell him , too , that however aeriel may be the Ghost , it weilds a weapon that might make its way through a mob at a contested election .
[ Exit . ]
Innis .
Gone off ?
- without so much as a single word with any meaning in it !
So then it i 'n' t Sir Archy neither !
So I suppose its nobody , all the time , but a trick !
O if I could catch that nasty old Fortune-teller !
- I am glad , however , I had not sent off poor Mr. Davis - O lud !
if I a 'n' t left all alone with the Closet !
[ runs out . ]
Scene 2 [ The Study of Lord Exbury .
Lord Exbury sits writing .
Enter Davis . ]
Davis .
May I come in ?
- O my lord , my lord , I have seen it !
Lord Exbury .
Seen what ?
Davis .
The lady , my lord !
the lady that walks - that is , I have seen nothing - for I durst not look up ,  we were all in the dark - but it came into the room while I was there , my lord ,  ordered me to go straight out of the house !
Lord Exbury .
Is it possible , Davis , you can suffer your imagination to transport you thus beyond reason ?
Davis .
O my lord , if you had heard such a sound of a voice as I have heard !
You would not think it imagination !
I never was afraid of the least thing in the World before - never since I was that high [ holding his hand a foot from the ground ] - unless it might just be a wild Cat - or perhaps a mad ox , - or it may be a Bull Dog - or - Lord Exbury .
And did this lady come from the closet Innis has been talking about ?
Davis .
I ca n't pretend to say where she came from , my lord , but she was perilous angry with me - though what for I know no more than the man in the moon - unless it might be the taking her house while she continues walking  for she told me that if ever she surprised me in it again , she 'd find a new way out of it for me !
- which , I take it , was pretty near the same thing as saying she 'd make away with me !
[ whispering ,  looking round affrighted . ]
Lord Exbury .
No more of this , Davis .
( 61 ) Let Innis go immediately in search of the house-keeper ,  insist upon a public examination of this closet :  do you tell my son Mordaunt that , if he is at leisure , I would speak with him .
Davis .
Yes , my lord .
- But it 's a sad thing not to be believed , just because one is not - sometimes - over-exact , just to a tittle !
Lord Exbury .
Let this be a lesson to you , Davis ,  the Ghost may prove your friend .
Davis .
I humbly hope , at least , your lordship wo n't stay any longer in this house , for I am fallen away already so with this fright - Lord Exbury .
Make haste , Davis .
Davis .
45 I dare say I weigh six or seven stone lighter than when I came into it .
Lord Exbury [ frowning ] .
Davis !
Davis [ in a melancholy tone ] .
Half a pound , I hope , at least , my lord , I may say !
[ Exit . ]
Lord Exbury .
How uniformly it seems the business of Credulity to forget Reason ,  annihilate Probability !
[ Re-enter Davis . ]
Davis .
I beg pardon , my lord , but I just saw , through the stair case window , the old Gentleman going by , who told all about the lady 's walking at Lord Ardville 's .
Lord Exbury .
O , Mr. Litchburn ?
I will hear his own account , then  for he is Just as scrupulous to be literal , as you are prodigal to exaggerate .
Tell him I should be glad of the pleasure of a moment 's conversation with him .
Davis .
Yes , my lord .
I wish I could know whether the Ghost appeared to him with that same trumpet voice it did to me !
but I dare say he 'll be bound over not to tell .
[ Exit . ]
Lord Exbury .
Whatever excites terror , however simply , ought to be traced to its source .
Wonder flourishes under obscurity ,  Fear has no better patron than mystery .
[ Enter Mr. Litchburn . ]
Litchburn [ before Lord Exbury perceives him ] .
I feel as cold as a stone at putting my feet into this house again .
Would I were safe out of it again !
 I fear 't is only to question me about lending poor dear Mr. Valentine the key to the Garden Stair-case .
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury [ turning round ] .
Mr. Litchburn , I am almost ashamed of troubling you about ( 62 ) so foolish a business  but I understand you are acquainted with some particulars relative to the idle report that this house is haunted ?
Litchburn .
Alack , yes , my lord !
but what 's the extraordinary , is to say , that what I have to offer upon this matter , is a something that nobody credits !
Lord Exbury .
If the subject is disagreeable to you - Litchburn .
No subject can be disagreeable to me , I hope , my lord , that your worthy lordship has the affability to call up ... not even ... [ lowering his voice ] the walking lady herself !
Lord Exbury .
Favour me , then , with the account .
Litchburn .
A young man in my service , my lord , cast an ... I am afraid ... a sort of an amourous glance at a young damsel belonging to the house-keeper of the lady lately deceased in this house .
A complaint being made to me , I forbad such naughtiness : but - you 'll never believe it , my lord !
- all I said was as good as thrown away !
Lord Exbury .
Well ?
Litchburn .
I 'll , rather , - humbly craving your lordship 's pardon for letting the truth slip out so rudely .
Never suspecting , however , but what I said had won upon him , I always took his part , when I was told of his tricks , 'till one day - it was a friday - the house-keeper came to me ,  , looking full in my face , said I had no Eyes !
Upon which , - rather in a pet , - I am afraid , - at such unceremoniousness , No Eyes , Mrs. Patson , says I  why then what may you call these two things here at each side of my nose ?
upon which she downright told me I was as good as blind !
for that the lad had got a key made to what they call the little Garden Stair-case !
Lord Exbury .
But what is this to the house being haunted ?
46 Litchburn .
It 's coming round , my lord , in a surprising manner .
I got the key from the lad , as it so happenned  on the very eve of the day that the late lady was defunct  but though I talked to him till the tears ran down my Cheeks at the melting things I said , I am dubious if they touched him  for only a week after the poor lady was buried , he took a ladder , at four o'clock in the morning ,  mounted it , to get into the house through a closet Window !
Lord Exbury .
O , - a closet ?
Litchburn .
Ah , my good lord , I can hardly tell you !
- but , just as he put his hands upon the Window frame - the dead lady appeared before him !
Lord Exbury .
Surely , Mr. Litchburn - Litchburn .
She shook her head at him , my lord , as who should say - What do you do here , young sinner ?
-  waved her hand , gracefully , - as I may do now  - upon which he felt himself turned , quite suddenly , from his wicked courses  - for he fell from the top of the ladder to the bottom !
Lord Exbury .
I should be better reconciled to Ghost stories , if I heard oftener so good a moral to them .
Litchburn .
He was brought home by some workmen quite in a stound  ( 63 )  when he came to himself , he confessed the whole   , what I think as much the extraordinary as any , he owned he was more struck with the sight of that dead lady , appearing to him for a moment , than with all I had been at the trouble of saying to him for so many days  hours !
Lord Exbury .
And can you really credit all this ?
Litchburn .
It 's surprising to say , my lord , but that is the identical question every body puts to me !
However , your good lordship does not yet know what 's to come !
I went to the house next day , purporting to deliver up the key , but a thing happenned so horrid , that it put it neat out of my head !
- which is the way that I had it for the service of your good son .
Lord Exbury .
How ?
- My Son ?
- Litchburn .
Dear Heart !
there 's the truth slipping out again !
However , pray , my good lord , take no notice of it to the poor young Gentleman , he having begged it to be kept secret ,  , most in particular , from your good lordship .
Lord Exbury .
Incorrigible Mordaunt !
what new clandestine scheme art thou pursuing ?
[ aside . ]
Proceed , Mr. Litchburn .
Litchburn .
I made a pretence , my lord , to go to the room where the closet is , not believing the thing then myself  but I found the door was locked !
- which it had never been before !
-  the House-keeper refused to signify to me the why or the wherefore !
-  now , my lord , to come to the worst at once , I contrived to peep through the key-hole -  there - I saw the spectre myself !
All white ,  standing as stiff as a post !
Just in this manner , as I may do now !
Lord Exbury .
My dear Mr. Litchburn - Litchburn .
I was never so nigh to a swoon in my life .
But I crept away , as well as I could - Lord Exbury .
Without informing the house-keeper what you had seen ?
Litchburn .
As she would not open the door , my lord , I naturally concluded her under influence .
Lord Exbury .
I had imagined superstition of this force confined to the wholly ignorant .
Litchburn .
Ah , my lord !
what a man has seen with his 47 Eyes , he finds hard to get out of his head - humbly craving your lordship 's pardon for taking the liberty to speak my opinion so uncomplaisantly : - which , indeed , my good Lord Ardville has broken me of doing , till it 's somewhat of the extraordinary I do n't forget the having one .
Lord Exbury .
I am much obliged to you , Mr. Litchburn , for this account   shall be still more so , if you will be kind enough to remain in the house about half an hour .
Litchburn [ bowing  retiring ] .
I should be a beast , my good lord , not to be happy to obey  - though , Heaven knows , I had as lief , to the very full , stand in the stocks - only I wo n't take such a liberty as to say so !
[ aside .
Exit . ]
Lord Exbury .
Poor simple soul !
it will be highly necessary to include him in the party present at unravelling this absurdity .
But I must now , alas !
exert myself for a far harder task than detecting a village apparition - the task of attempting to touch a heart grown callous to Reason ,  dead to Nature , yet alive , `` tremblingly alive , '' ( 64 ) to every folly of Fashion .
Davis !
[ Enter Davis . ]
Is not Mordaunt coming ?
Davis .
I will call him again , my lord .
I wish the Ghost would call him !
I warrant he would not want so many biddings !
[ Exit . ]
Lord Exbury .
Yet , had it been he who thus had failed me , though for his sake alone I have forced this severe measure upon my family , it would less acutely have wounded me .
Our disappointments are but proportioned to our expectations   what are the paternal hopes that Mordaunt has not long since blighted ?
But Valentine - by him to be deserted in distress !
- by him , neglected in sorrow !
Where must I look for sympathy ?
to whom turn for zeal , or virtue ?
- O Valentine !
son of my cherished hopes !
whatever it may be that hath wrought thee to this change , short be its duration , that I may know again my son !
[ Enter Mordaunt . ]
Mordaunt .
I am afraid I have made you wait , my lord .
Lord Exbury .
Not much .
What unfeeling ease !
[ aside . ]
Mordaunt .
Not that you can have any thing of consequence to do with your time , to be sure , in such a place as this .
Lord Exbury .
Astonishing !
his courage almost diverts me of self-command !
[ aside . ]
Mordaunt .
Had not you better sit down , my lord ?
[ taking a Chair ,  seating himself . ]
Lord Exbury .
My heart swells with resentment .
I shall become violent .
I had better postpone my purpose .
[ aside . ]
Mordaunt .
The truth is , I was taking a little nap .
Lord Exbury .
How he disorders me !
Is this apathy ?
or assurance ?
[ aside . ]
Mordaunt .
I have a miserable room up there , my lord  full of holes c.acks .
This is much better , - of the two .
Lord Exbury .
I must not lecture him now .
I dare not trust myself .
[ aside . ]
Mr. Exbury , [ with constrained calmness . ]
I will not detain you at present .
Come to me in the evening .
Mordaunt .
Very well , my lord .
But I was thinking , if you make no other use of this room than just writing in it , if you could not as well change with me .
Lord Exbury .
I am urged too far !
[ aside ] Mordaunt !
- [ with 48 emotion . ]
Mordaunt [ without looking at him ] .
Being visited by the zephyrs where one sleeps , wo n't do at all .
Lord Exbury [ with severity ] .
Mordaunt !
Mordaunt [ still looking another way ] .
And as to the shabbiness of the room , it ca n't much signify  for you 'll never think of letting any one in while we live in such a manner as this .
Lord Exbury .
I am overpowered !
[ aside . ]
Mordaunt !
[ striking his hand upon the Table ] hear me !
Mordaunt [ starting ] .
What 's the matter , my lord ?
Lord Exbury .
It is strange ,  , no doubt , it is wrong , but I am not master of myself sufficiently to disguise that your insensibility , at this moment , offends me yet more keenly than your vices !
Mordaunt .
So !
now the Storm is coming on !
[ aside , but keeping his seat . ]
Lord Exbury .
Various are the excuses ,  many the palliations for the indiscretions of youth , where repentance follows misdeeds ,  error is succeeded by calamity : but so impenetrably are you hardened , that you seem as indifferent to the consequences of your faults , as to their heinousness .
Mordaunt .
I am frightened to death lest I should drop asleep before he has done !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
The smallest appearance of concern would soften us all  one single moment of contrition subdue us completely .
- Mordaunt .
He 'll never forgive it if I do !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
But no !
you drive your sister , in her first bloom , from the World  rob your Brother , in his opening prospects , of the assistance of his family ,  sever your Father , in the decline of his life , from his friends , his habits ,  his comforts .
- Mordaunt .
I wish he 'd have done !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
And all with as careless an indolence as if you were but blowing bubbles into the air !
- alas !
bubbles we are indeed !
- not , it is true , so gay in our colours , or so transparent in our composition , but as unsubstantial , as frail , -  , nearly , as evanescent !
Mordaunt .
He do n't talk ill - if he were not so long .
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
And for what ?
- tell me , I beseech !
for what have you adopted expences thus ruinous to your fortune ,  destructive of your integrity ?
For what , I conjure you tell me !
- are we all round sacrificed - Will you not answer ?
Mordaunt [ starting ] .
My lord ?
Lord Exbury .
Has it been to assist some object in distress ?
Mordaunt .
Sir !
Lord Exbury .
To help a friend ?
Mordaunt .
Ha ?
Lord Exbury .
To serve your country ?
Mordaunt .
What a set of queer questions !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
No !
- it has been but to buy finer Horses than some other spendthrift !
to bet higher wagers 49 than some other profligate !
 to drown reason in better wines than some other futile waster of life  faculties !
Mordaunt .
He does not spare for cutting !
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury .
Pitiful pre-eminence !
Ambition is not a word it merits  even the meanest is higher - even the greatest not more mischievous .
Yet you have the courage to complain of an inconvenience !
Mordaunt !
if your privations were incurred by doing good to a single fellow creature , they would render you an object of pity  but in springing solely from your own wilful folly , they must be considered but as a part of it .
[ a pause . ]
Are you determined not to answer ?
Mordaunt .
My lord !
Lord Exbury .
Perhaps you have not even heard me ?
Well , sir , I have done !
This total want of feeling you think , I presume , philosophy ?
But have a care how you support it !
You can see , unmoved , your family in anguish  but - mean , wretched trembler at the imperious bar of Fashion !
- let any one inform you , that your Hat is not in the dimensions of that last fop whose model has been admired -  you will change colour ,  betray immediate disturbance !
Mordaunt .
My hat , my lord ?
[ looking at it anxiously . ]
What 's the matter with my hat ?
Lord Exbury .
O Mordaunt , it is time , indeed , I should have done !
I have not been able to touch you - but I have tortured myself !
[ Exit . ]
Mordaunt .
I thought he would mount his great horse .
But what the devil put it in his head to talk of my hat ?
Is it not the thing , I wonder ?
Plague take it !
- not that he understands much of the matter .
He has cured me of my sleeping fit , however !
He 's been cursedly severe .
But I forgive him .
He is not quite without reason .
I 've been but a fool , I believe .
I feel devilish queer .
I must not give the thing up , though .
I 'll go look for the Fortuneteller , I think -  make him send me a few shepherdesses to amuse me .
[ Exit . ]
Scene 3 [ A beautiful country prospect , presenting distant hills ,  groups of Trees .
Enter Dawson . ]
Dawson .
Now if I were not looking for this fellow , I should meet him at every turn .
A sorry rascal !
one of his pieces of fun , quotha ?
I wish I could light on him !
I 'd soon teach him to make so merry with me !
Mrs. Innis is a very smart Girl , no doubt  but what am I ?
- If ever she meets with a man who for good looks , or a pretty sort of way with him , or a genteel turn , is so much as to be compared with me - I 'll say I 'm no judge  - that 's all !
[ Enter a Wood Cutter , loaded . ]
This way , my lad !
- Have you seen any thing in your walks of a grim hulky fellow that 's lurking here abouts ?
Wood Cutter .
Not I !
I be seeing after something mainly better .
I do no ' look for such like .
Dawson .
Why he 's a cunning man .
He could tell you your fortune .
Wood Cutter .
Could he ?
I do guess I could tell it myself , partly .
Dawson .
Ay ?
What is it , then ?
Wood Cutter .
Neighbour 's fare  to work hard till it comes ,  then pleay till it goes !
Dawson .
Will you help me to hunt him ?
Wood Cutter .
Ay , master - when I can not get better game .
But I be but of a faint stomach to start after the worst , when I may start after the best .
Dawson .
50 The best ?
Why you do n't pretend to be a Sportsman ?
Wood Cutter .
Yes , but I do .
Dawson .
And what do you chace ?
Wood Cutter .
Three things , master , that may be but a trifle to great folk , but that do serve to keep me in special plight :  the first , it be a good stomach , by earning with my hands what I do put into my mouth  the second , it be good rest at nights , by falling foul of no man ,  the third , it be the best of any , for it be a sweet'ningto all my labours , an they were tenfold more  for it be the promise of Kate that , come the day she will marry me .
 then , I warr ` nt you , we shall bless one another with such a mart of little ones , as there wo n't be the like in all the parish .
 we will tend 'em ,  nurse 'em , together - till we be old enough ,  weakly enough , for they to tend  nurse we .
Dawson .
Who 's Kate ?
Wood Cutter .
Do no ' you know Kate ?
You do come from some far country , thee  for , here about , there be none so oafish but do know pretty Kate .
Dawson .
Well but , my lad , - Wood Cutter .
I canno ' prate any more , man , for I do think I see her , yinder  -  if it be she , she be looking for I. [ Exit . ]
Dawson .
Now that such a young rascal as that can get a pretty Girl to trip after him sooner than such a man as I !
If it do n't make me sick , I 'm a dog .
However , Mrs. Innis may do as she likes  but if she lives to be as old as Mother Red Cap ,  as ugly as Mother Shipton , ( 65 ) she 'll never have such another offer as mine .
I question , indeed , when all 's put together - little as I am given to think much of my own merits - whether such another offer ( 66 ) is to be had .
[ Exit . ]
[ Enter Hilaria . ]
Hilaria .
Ah , here I am again , enjoying this delightful retreat , once more in happy liberty .
Are the beauties of Nature all left to the poorer classes ?
And when again I have a Carriage , shall I again neglect them ?
Arrange my head so daintily as to dread every wind of Heaven ?
My feet so slightly , that they will shrink from the touch of the Earth ?
And make all the elements my enemies by the delicacy of my apparel ?
Relinquish views that enrapture my senses ?
Exercise , that invigorates my health ?
And a contemplation of Nature in its sweet simplicity that exalts my Soul ?
Ah , if even in solitude I am thus enchanted , what must be the rural life with a chosen companion ?
How my reflections run away with me !
I must not heed them .
No !
Happiness is so impossible without Wealth - What are those two young Persons ?
A pair of true loveyers by their fond looks .
Poor wretches !
how I pity them !
And can Love exist where toil must occupy the time ,  meanness the character ?
[ Enter the Wood Cutter , with a load of wood ,  the Hay Maker , with a rake , holding by his arm .
Hilaria retreats , but keeps in sight . ]
Hay Maker .
Nay , nay , but put down thy load ,  rest thee , dear Tom .
Wood Cutter .
Dost think me tired -  thee so nigh , Kate ?
Hay Maker .
Nay , but a while , Tom  - I do pray it of thee !
Wood Cutter [ unloading ] .
Then will I do it , for I can gainsay thee in nothing .
Wilt not sit by me , Kate ?
Nay , nigher .
- Dost think I would hurt thee , my wench ?
Dost not know I would die first ?
But why dost take it in thy fancy , Kate , that I be so main soon tired ?
An I were such a poor hand as that , what would become of thee when we shall be fetching a walk together of a Sunday ,  three or four of thy little ones be clinging about us , c.lling out , Dad !
take me up !
Pretty dears !
dost 51 think I could let 'em crawl on ?
No , no  I be n't so stone-hearted .
Hay Maker [ turning from him ] .
Nay , Tom , nay !
- Wood Cutter .
Why art thy cheeks so red , Kate ?
Be ` st ashamed ?
Thee ` llt be the loveliest mother in all the Parish .
How shall I bestride me home , when I bethink me that thee  thy little ones be on the watch for me !
I shall have my heart in my shoes , Kate , till I get to thee -  then , I warr ` nt , it will be bouncing into thy bosom .
But I 'll ne'er come within till I have earned wherewithal to gladden thee .
Hay Maker .
Ah , Tom !
will not thy sight do that ?
How will I rub , c.ean ,  brighten my platters ,  my pans ,  my nice red bricks , to make them all shine ,  look sightly , to welcome thee !
Wood Cutter .
But , Kate , why be ` st thee so shy ?
Shalt not like to see thy own little prattlers , climbing up thy knees ,  playing pretty gambols around thee ?
Hay Maker .
If thee couldst keep 'em , Tom !
- Wood Cutter .
Keep 'em , Kate ?
Look at my arm ?
What dost fancy 't was gi'n me for ?
not to dandle beside me , like a lout ,  do nothing , but to work for thee , Kate !
to fight for thee ,  to hold thee to my heart !
[ going to embrace her . ]
Hay Maker .
Nay , nay , - but not yet , Tom !
- Wood Cutter .
But when , Kate , when ?
- We ha ' been asked out  out  when , then , when ?
Hay Maker .
Art thee not too poor , Tom , yet ?
Wood Cutter .
Dost want to be rich , Kate ?
Hay Maker .
Yes , Tom , - for Thee !
Wood Cutter .
And for Thee , my Kate , I be proud to be poor !
How could I prove my true love , an I were rich ?
I could but go share  share with what I should not know which way to withhold from thee : but now , my Kate , I will work - that Thou mayst feed : I will labour , - that Thou mayst be cloathed :  with the sweat of my brow I will thatch the roof that shall shelter thy dear head !
Where 's the rich man , Kate , that can prove true love like this ?
- When , then , when ?
Hay Maker .
Dear Tom - when thee wilt !
Wood Cutter .
Sunday ?
Hay Maker .
Ah , Tom !
- 't be but three days to Sunday !
Wood Cutter .
Ah , Kate !
- will not every day after be shorter ?
Hay Maker .
If thee thinkst so , Tom - Wood Cutter .
Come , then , let 's to the Parson together ,  tell him a bit of our mind .
I 'll make thee a koind husband , Kate !
Hay Maker .
Dear Tom !
- I 'll make thee a loving Wife !
[ Exeunt . ]
Hilaria [ coming forward ] .
Heavens !
what a scene !
I feel almost annihilated !
- I might have spared , alas , my pity for myself !
Can I see ,  not emulate , affection that has thus its source in Virtue ?
O Valentine !
for Thee could I not , also , watch  wait ?
listen for thy step ,  at thy loved approach - [ The Strange Man crosses the stage . ]
Ah , there 's that ill looking man I observed skulking about yesterday .
He seems watching for some one ,  , I fear , with evil intent .
- Oh happy Pair !
Objects of Envy , not disdain !
I will fit up , at least , your little cottage , I will furnish your wedding Garments , I will - Ah !
Sir 52 Archy - Now must I rally - or die !
- [ Enter Sir Archy Fineer . ]
Sir Archy .
Ah ha , my little Cousin !
whither are you running ?
To Gretna Green ?
Hilaria .
I am glad , at least , you are in such good humour .
I was almost afraid to see you .
Sir Archy .
No , no  we must never dwell upon grievances .
But whence comes it , my fair fugitive , you think it necessary to lead your poor Strephon such a dance ?
Hilaria .
O Sir Archy !
I must speak to you sincerely .
I am ready to expire !
- 'T is so shocking - so abominable , giving a man one 's hand , when one hates him so cordially !
I have been considering the matter over gravely ,  thinking what my horror will be , when I get into my carriage - O Sir Archy !
- to see Him at my Elbow !
- when I enter my house to have no right to prevent Him from entering it also !
-  , when I want to be alone - O Sir Archy !
- to make a scruple of bidding the footman shut the door in his face !
Sir Archy .
Why all this is rather irksome , I confess .
Hilaria .
Is it not provoking one ca n't marry a man 's fortune , without marrying himself ?
that one ca n't take a fancy to his mansions , his parks , his establishment , - but one must have his odious society into the bargain ?
Sir Archy .
But think how soon you 'll be free .
Hilaria .
No  I hate to think about people 's dying .
Sir Archy .
But you do n't hate to think about people 's being comfortably wrapt in fleecy hosiery , - reclined on an easy chair ,  unable , by the month together , to hop after  torment their fair mates ?
Hilaria .
Why no - that is not quite disagreeable .
But , really , poor Women are cruelly off : 't is so prodigious a temptation to be made mistress in a moment of mansions , carriages , domestics - to have Time , Power ,  Pleasure cast at once at their disposal - Sir Archy .
And where is the cruelty of all this ?
Hilaria .
It 's accompaniment is so often discordant !
If the regard of Lord Ardville be sincere - why can he not settle half his wealth upon me at once , without making me a prisoner for life in return ?
Sir Archy .
Why that would be disinterested , I own  but you must forgive the brightness of your Eyes , that has rendered him more selfish .
He is not , however , illiberal , for he had proposed this very morning adorning your breakfast Table with a case of Jewels of the finest Gems of the East .
Hilaria .
Indeed ?
But how came they to be set so soon ?
Sir Archy .
They belonged to his late lady , during his splendid Eastern embassy .
But that is of no import to you .
You are deciding , I find , upon a more simple mode of life ?
Hilaria .
I think so !
Sir Archy .
And a mate who has none of these fopperies to present to you ?
Hilaria .
No , no , no mate at all .
Sir Archy .
You blush a little , though - Ah , Cousin !
after prospects , offers , possessions such as these - shall I wait upon you to dine on a scrag of mutton ,  a rice pudding ?
Hilaria .
No , no , no !
- 53 Sir Archy .
Hear you ring your bell , when you want to go out , that you may order - your Pattens ?
( 67 ) Hilaria .
Fie - Sir Archy .
When I enquire for your servant at a public place , hearken to a child 's voice that squeaks out , Ready , Sir !
 see a little Imp jump up , not three feet high ?
Hilaria .
What pleasure you take in teizing !
Sir Archy .
Or , when I call your Carriage for you myself , be told - 't is Number 347 ?
( 68 ) Hilaria .
You are quite ill-natured .
I 'll hear no more .
[ walking away . ]
Sir Archy .
And will you , also , see no more ?
[ producing a chagrin case . ]
( 69 ) Hilaria .
What do you mean ?
Sir Archy .
That before you entirely decide , you will view the contents of this case , entrusted to my presentation by his lordship .
Hilaria .
No , no !
Sir Archy [ opening the box ] .
Tell me if ever - Hilaria .
I wo n't see them , I protest .
[ walking off , but looking back . ]
How they glitter !
Sir Archy .
Ah , sweet Coz !
Hilaria .
Nay , I do n't deny it 's a sort of madness to refuse - but I have witnessed , just now , so touching a union of happiness with simplicity , nay , with poverty , that - Sir Archy .
I know , then , what you are thinking of !
but when you hear that a certain youth - now why cast down your Eyes ?
- is utterly ruined - Hilaria .
Good heaven !
Sir Archy .
Ay , to his last shilling !
- but 't is a secret , because an affair of honour .
( 70 ) You must not , therefore , even hint at it .
Nor should I divulge it , but to shew you , in time , your alternative .
Valentine is only gone to town , to escape from a person who is come down into the Country to arrest him .
Hilaria .
That 's the very man , then , I have seen dodging about !
Dear unhappy Lord Exbury !
- And can Valentine too , - even Valentine - O Sir Archy !
- Sir Archy .
You will have a thousand opportunities to serve them all when Lady Ardville  but you can only encrease their distress in any other capacity .
Hilaria .
Give me , then , the Jewels !
[ seizing the case ] Beautiful as they are , I will but possess to devote them to the aid of my beloved  excellent Guardian , to whom of right they ought to belong !
Sir Archy .
You accept them ?
Hilaria .
Alas - Yes !
- I do !
- Sir Archy .
Lord Ardville will be at your feet , then , in ten minutes .
Hilaria .
Well - it ca n't be helped !
- I 'll never allow myself to think again - that 's all !
[ Exit abruptly . ]
Sir Archy [ laughing ] .
54 Shew me the Woman who can resist a case of Jewels ,  - Egad ,  I 'll look out for a Gamester who 'll decline to hold a Pharo Table !
[ Exit . ]
END OF ACT IV Act V Scene 1 [ The beautiful country landscape , with hills  groups of trees .
Mordaunt saunters in . ]
Mordaunt .
I see nothing of this conjuror .
It 's being devilishly hard driven to look out for such a resource   , after all , as the good old Gentleman says , what the deuce it is makes us run this cursed race ,  never stop till we are blown up , ( 71 ) is more than I quite understand , though I have played so deeply in the Game .
I thought to have found it devilishly pleasanter .
But every body does it .
So there 's no help .
Ha !
probably that 's my necromancer !
[ Enter the Strange Man . ]
Strange Man .
Why I can light of all on um but Mr. Walentine .
[ aside . ]
Mordaunt .
Harkee , friend - Are you the fellow that tells fortunes in this neighbourhood ?
Strange Man .
Ay , your honour , one does what one can to turn a penny .
Mordaunt .
Well , I sha 'n' t fatigue your ingenuity to tell me mine  but , harkee , - go towards the village ,  , by means of your art , persuade the first two or three young damsels you meet , that , if they come to this spot , they will see the exact resemblance of their destined sweethearts .
Here !
[ gives him money . ]
Strange Man .
Very well , your honour .
- Icod , this is rare fun enough !
I 'll tip the Master the same compliment I tipt the Wallets .
I likes to serve all with the same sarse .
[ aside .
Exit . ]
Mordaunt .
Now let 's see what this will do for us - scanning the ideas of little field savages upon Love  Marriage .
Devilishly hard driven !
devilishly !
I wish to my Soul I had never touched a dice .
- Ah ha !
one of the Natives coming down already !
How eagerly she sucks in his fine promises !
Poor little toad !
't is almost ill-natured to set her upon looking out for a man of my figure among her louts of lovers .
It may make her turn off Pretender after Pretender , till she ends in leading apes .
( 72 ) [ Enter the Hay Maker . ]
Ha !
here already !
- What shall I do to prevent her being afraid of me ?
She can hardly ever have been spoken to by a man of Fashion before .
Come hither , little maid .
You 're a pretty Girl , ` pon honour .
Hay Maker .
So they do tell me , Master .
[ courtsying . ]
Mordaunt .
They do , do they ?
But you do n't believe them ?
Hay Maker .
Foie , then !
I do believe all the World .
But so Tom do fancy me , it be all one to I what I be .
Mordaunt .
Tom ?
O , there 's a Tom , is there ?
Hay Maker .
Yes  And I be a looking for him up  down .
May hap you do know to shew me which way he be ?
Mordaunt .
O , very likely !
Hay Maker .
You may be years  years before you do guess the good luck I have to tell him .
Why one of the fine folk come to yon house thinder , have sent me a new Gown ,  Tom a new Coat , for no one yearthly thing but for we two to be married in !
Mordaunt .
And is that what brought you this way ?
55 Hay Maker .
Why no , - partly - for I do think Tom be gone yinder , up the hill .
But I did meet with a man who do say he be a Conjuror   he told me if I would be of good heart , to look at something froightful , an I would come this way ,  star it full in the face , it would bring me main good luck .
Mordaunt .
And is that all he said to you about coming to this spot ?
Hay Maker .
Yes  And I be a peering  a looking ,  a looking  a peering ,  no one yearthly thing can I see but only you - so I do hope no offence , but I do e ` en almost think it must be You , Master .
Mordaunt .
What !
Hay Maker .
Why you would no ' be sorry to bring a poor lassy good luck - would ee , now ?
Mordaunt .
Why what the deuce !
do you think I look like something froightful , then ?
Hay Maker .
You may n't be affronted , Master , for you may be main good , an you be never so plain .
Mordaunt .
I may , may I ?
Commend me to your consolation !
I appear to you very plain , then , do I ?
Hay Maker .
Nay , Master , I 've seen worser looking men  - no offence , I hope .
Mordaunt .
O , you have ?
That 's comforting , however .
Hay Maker .
There be our parish clerk - he have a hair lip   a large big wart do hang to his Chin , that do make him look like unto a scare crow .
Mordaunt .
O , so you think I am rather better than a scare crow ?
Hay Maker .
Yes , I do , Master .
Mordaunt .
You do ?
I wish I may die if this i 'n' t agreeable enough !
 pray , what 's Tom ?
I must not presume , I suppose , to be as handsome as Tom ?
Hay Maker .
As Tom ?
Why he be the likeliest lad of all our Parish !
He be as ruddy as a rose ,  as strait as a Poplar   his two Eyes do shoine as broight as two glow worms in a dark lane after sun set .
You as handsome as Tom ?
Why all our folk would e ` en almost laugh to hear you .
Mordaunt .
They would , would they ?
I am only like the Parish clerk , then , maybe ?
Hay Maker .
Ah , yinder he be !
I must run to tell him of our fine new geer .
[ Exit . ]
Mordaunt .
A facetious encounter enough !
My Fortuneteller is a good pleasant sort of a wag .
I should not be sorry to lop both his Ears off .
A Parish clerk , with a hare lip ,  a large big wort pendant from the Chin !
- A little ignorant , impertinent Pauper !
- Well , it i 'n' t worth resenting  but I 'll make off before I have any more of this rural sport .
I 've had enough .
[ Exit . ]
[ Enter Lord Ardville  Sir Archy . ]
Lord Ardville .
I am ill disposed to go on , Sir Archy .
Sir Archy .
O , relent , my lord , relent !
The freaks of female youth are not worth a man 's attention .
Leave them alone ,  they wear away of themselves - though 't is odds , I own , but they wear you away first !
[ aside . ]
Lord Ardville .
It may be so , Sir Archy  but I beg it mav be understood I submit to no liberties , let them be 56 obtruded from what quarter they may .
Sir Archy .
Nay , nay , my lord , 't is vain to oppose Destiny .
What Hero has borne , you must bear .
A young Beauty , in the first flight of her charms , makes at every point of attraction in half an Hour  now radiant in smiles , now glowing with blushes , now melting into Tears .
No Fawn is more timid , - yet no Colt is so skittish  no Dove is more tender - yet no monkey so delights in mischief .
If she looks at you with softness turn  see what Rival she would hang , or drown  if she exclaim You are a good Creature !
make speedy enquiry if she has not told her confident you are a fool : - but , if she says You wicked Wretch , I ca n't bear You !
- open your arms , - for she means to run into them .
Yet call her capricious ,  she breaks with you !
Call her false -  she only pats you with her Fan .
Reproach her with a foible ,  she is like a heroine in despair : forsake her alltogether ,  , in three weeks the little Gipsey stares at You as a new acquaintance .
You storm - she laughs  you reason - she pouts : you humble yourself - she softens  you catch her - but , if you look another way , though it be but to thank your stars - before you can look again , she is dancing off !
- Ah , my lord , what sleepy business were life , if Woman , - as well as Man , were , really , a rational being !
Lord Ardville .
I never yet formed a plan that was so ill combined as to fail , Sir Archy   , I wish to have it understood , I never intend it .
Sir Archy .
This will not produce an exception , be assured , my lord .
Lord Ardville .
Well , sir , if you are so confident - Sir Archy .
I am .
Come on , my lord , come on !
Scene 2 [ The inner Chamber .
Enter Hilaria , with the case of Jewels . ]
Hilaria .
In this room , I shall be free from interruption , for no one dare enter it .
O Valentine !
- but I will never think of him again !
- No !
- I will provide for the virtuous Wood-Cutter  Hay-maker - but never ruminate upon their happy lot - No !
- I will examine these beautiful gems ,  dwell upon the plan of good which shall succeed when their novelty is over , - but admit no retrospection !
- none !
none !
- O Valentine !
I must turn wholly from the past ,  strain every nerve , to acquire courage , at length , to look this frightful old Peer in the face .
[ opens the case . ]
They are really most sumptuous .
I 'll shut the door  try them on .
[ Shuts the door ,  goes to a looking glass . ]
How becoming this is !
- And how elegant this !
- O , I never saw such a love as this beautiful - ah !
- Good God !
- who 's there ?
- [ Valentine , softly opening the private door , advances gently ,  appears to her in the Glass . ]
Valentine .
Once again , madam , - Hilaria .
Heavens !
Valentine .
And yet more unopportunely than before , I have the misfortune to give you unwelcome surprise  but the employment which I interrupt , shews me that the purpose for which I ventured to approach you is already out of date .
[ He retires . ]
Hilaria .
[ in great confusion , pulling of the Jewels ,  putting them into the case ] .
I was only - I did not mean - I was merely - [ turning round ] .
He is gone !
- what a barbarous incident !
He will think me revelling in the spoils of which I seem to bereave his family !
- And if he appear now , he will be seized by that horrible bailiff !
- Ah !
[ runs to the door he has just closed . ]
Mr. Exbury !
- Mr. Valentine !
- Valentine [ returning ] .
Do you permit me to come back ?
Hilaria .
For heaven 's sake , be careful how you leave the 57 house !
- There is a man - there is a person - who is watching - who , I hear from Sir Archy - Valentine .
Is it possible !
has Sir Archy betrayed - Hilaria .
No , no - he only said - I only gathered - in short , never mind how I heard it , but do n't terrify me by running into the very midst of danger !
Valentine .
Amiable , generous Hilaria !
Would You save Me ,  shall I not try to save You ?
Since my ruined situation is now known to You , I may speak with more propriety , more courage , for in learning that I am ... undone , you can not deem me villain enough to mean to plead for myself .
Hilaria .
And what do I care for any thing else ?
[ aside . ]
Valentine .
I must be plain , for my time is short .
May I - will you give me leave to be explicit ?
Hilaria .
What is it you wish to say ?
Valentine .
I would frankly urge you to examine your own motives for accepting Lord Ardville .
Hilaria .
Pshaw !
Valentine .
And I would honestly point out to you the consequences for yourself to which your acceptance may lead .
Hilaria .
I can see no use in all this - but if it will give you any pleasure - Valentine .
With a thousand native good qualities - sweetness , sense , kindness , spirit - You have suffered yourself - pardon me , Miss Dalton , to become merely a Vassal , a cypher in the dominion of Fashion .
Hilaria .
And who , that lives in the World , is otherwise ?
Valentine .
All - who dare think for themselves , or who feel for others !
Hilaria .
Your most obedient !
Valentine .
Let me not anger you - yet I come forward now solely as a friend ,  if I can hope to convince , must refrain from sparing you .
But , not of you , individually , do I at this moment speak : your excellencies would counterbalance a thousand foibles  I mean but to paint that vortex of Fashion into which you are drawn ,  to whose capricious , but despotic laws , if you are not upon your guard , Time  habit may reconcile you .
Hilaria .
Only one previous question : do not you allow yourself to be - rather - a little - severe ?
Valentine .
You must judge that  but , if I am just , disdain not to listen .
The votaries , the general votaries of Fashion , weak rather than wicked , are less the slaves of their own follies , than of those of others .
They do not , therefore , in their matrimonial choice , enquire whom they prefer , or whom they dislike : their sole solicitude is to gather whom their associates will approve , or will scorn .
For themselves , if self-consulted , they might , perhaps , acknowledge , that an amiable companion would make them happier than the trappings of a Coach horse  but when they ask what is said around them , they find the equipage alone considered the Companion not thought of : his disposition never investigated , his principles never examined , his humours , his age , nay , his character left to chance - as if all , save his establishment , were immaterial to happiness .
Hilaria .
Now do n't say more shocking things than you can help !
Valentine .
58 For purposes such as these - for the gratification of bye standers , the applause of lookers on - are we to chuse the friends of our bosom ?
- the Partners of our days ?
Hilaria .
Why it is but - foolish , to be sure !
Valentine .
For This was that sacred union ordained ?
For This were we gifted with descriminative faculties ?
Invested with taste ?
Endued with powers of reflexion ?
a sense of virtue ?
a love of excellence ?
a soul of sympathy ?
- Hilaria [ turning away from him ] .
Now do n't speak -  look too !
Valentine .
You wish , I know , to unite Love with Fashion ?
Hilaria [ turning quick back to him ] .
You are right !
That alone would answer my ideas of complete felicity .
Valentine .
And will the heart , think you , be content to be the servant of Appearance ?
No !
You will find such a union impracticable .
The happiness of true Love is domestic life : the very existence of Fashion is public admiration .
Hilaria [ disturbed ] .
We do n't , you know , all think exactly alike about these things - however , make haste , - for really - Valentine [ with encreased energy ] .
Do those who trample upon Nature , imagine they destroy her ?
The attempt is shallow  vain .
While we breath the vital air , while existence is accorded us , be she abused , disguised , offended as she may , Nature will still rise triumphant ,  assert her claims !
Hilaria [ with emotion ] .
Well , now - is not this enough ?
Valentine [ with a softened tone ] .
Ah then !
- when you are satiated with art ,  artifice ,  Nature - all powerful Nature , resume her dominion - when the vanities of life , losing their charm with their novelty , give silent , instinctive way to the impressions of the heart , how dreadful the self-view of the wilful martyr at the shrine of Interest !
- Hilaria .
No more !
- no more !
- Valentine .
Honour bartered for wealth - yet irretrievably shackled !
- Tenderness cast away for shew , - yet divested of all right of complaint !
- Domestic bliss sacrificed for luxury - yet never more to be attained !
- nor even sought , nor even hoped for , - except by the fatal road of frailty - dishonour -  guilty , premeditated divorce !
Hilaria [ bursting into tears ] .
O Valentine !
- you wish to kill me !
Valentine .
Mercenary ties are ultimately miserable , because radically dishonest .
Virtuous love is as truly the principle of conjugal happiness , as untainted integrity is of bosom repose .
To forego the first , you consign your youth to regret  to tarnish the last , you deliver up your latter days to remorse .
Hilaria [ casting herself upon the sofa ] .
I die !
Valentine [ kneeling ,  kissing her hand ] .
Forgive -  forget me !
- but remember my exhortation , -  bestow not your unhallowed hand , where you withhold your generous heart !
[ Exit , with precipitation . ]
[ Hilaria covers her face ,  remains motionless .
Enter Davis . ]
Davis [ standing at the door ] .
Lord Ardville , ma'am ,  Sir Archy Fineer Hilaria [ starting up ] .
Where is Lord Exbury ?
[ runs out . ]
Davis .
She goes so fast , I take it , for fear of the closet !
I 'm sure I wo n't be behind hand !
[ running after . ]
Scene 3 59 [ Lord Exbury 's Study .
Lord Exbury sits writing . ]
Hilaria [ without ] .
Where is Lord Exbury ?
[ Enter Hilaria .
She runs to Lord Exbury  flings herself upon one knee before him . ]
Hilaria .
I cast myself upon your goodness , my dear lord , I fly to you for aid - counsel - support !
Save me , I beseech you , the horror of an explanation with Lord Ardville , - save me the danger of derision  persecution from Sir Archy !
Act for me , dearest Lord Exbury !
I am upon the brink of perjury  wretchedness ,  have not fortitude to act for myself !
Lord Exbury [ raising her ] .
Rise , my dear Hilaria  this posture oppres ses me .
What can I ever have power to do for you , that the most simple request will not obtain ?
Hilaria .
O my lord !
I recoil with penitence from the ungenerous part I have been performing !
My Eyes are now opened ,  I look back upon myself with disdain .
Lord Exbury .
What step do you wish me to take ?
Hilaria .
Send for Lord Ardville , return him these Jewels ,  tell him I ca n't help it , - but - I find I hate him more  more !
- Lord Exbury .
And is that all ?
[ half smiling . ]
Hilaria .
I know I have no right to impose upon you so disagreeable a task , yet , consider - Lord Exbury .
I do consider that the impulse of Conscience ought never to be checked .
You shall command me .
Is my Brother here ?
Hilaria .
Yes , with Sir Archy Fineer , in the chamber they called the Ghost room .
Lord Exbury .
That may prove a fortunate circumstance  to speak of so ludicrous a report , will somewhat lessen the awkward solemnity of our meeting .
Mordaunt  my daughter shall accompany me to receive him   , while they engage the attention of Sir Archy , I will execute as I can !
- my commission .
[ Exit . ]
Hilaria .
Heavens !
if Valentine should have neglected to fasten the private door !
- I 'll fly to the adjoining room ,  watch ,  , if there should be any danger - run every risk to turn it from - or share it with him !
[ Exit . ]
Scene 4 [ The inner Chamber .
Lord Ardville ,  Sir Archy Fineer .
Enter , to them , Lord Exbury , Mordaunt ,  Miss Exbury . ]
Lord Exbury .
Sir Archy , your most obedient Brother , let me welcome you to my Cottage , where , if I can not regale you according to my wishes , I may at least amuse you beyond your expectations , for know !
you are now in a Chamber that , by village report , is haunted .
Miss Exbury .
O , it 's vastly foolish to believe in such things , but yet , I can assure you - [ Enter Davis . ]
Davis [ only putting his head in the door ] .
My lord , Mr. Litchburn humbly begs to know whether he may go home ?
not that he presumes , he says , to be in any hurry , for he is very sensible , he says , of the honour of waiting two hours in the cold  only - Lord Exbury .
Poor Mr. Litchburn !
I really beg his pardon .
He is a principal character in this Ghost drama .
Ask him up .
Davis .
Up here , my lord ?
Sir Archy [ laughing ] .
Ah , Davis , you have not forgotten our Ghost 60 adventure ?
Why do you only put in your head ?
Davis .
Please your honour - that my heels may be on the road to carry it off !
[ Exit . ]
Miss Exbury .
Sir Archy is amazingly at his ease , I think !
however , I am very glad of it , for he 's so vastly shy about the settlement  the Pin money , that it has quite conquered my partiality for him .
[ aside . ]
Lord Exbury [ apart to Mordaunt ] .
Mordaunt , did I not beg you to entertain Sir Archy while I spoke with your Uncle ?
Mordaunt .
My lord ?
- I entertain Sir Archy ?
- what the deuce can the good old Gentleman have gotten into his head to suppose I should take that trouble ?
[ aside ,  throwing himself on the sofa . ]
[ Enter Mr. Litchburn , shewn in by Davis , who is retiring . ]
Miss Exbury .
Come in , Davis .
I want you to shew me the very spot where the Ghost appeared to you .
[ Makes Davis enter , with whom she discourses apart . ]
Litchburn .
My good lord !
I humbly hope your good lordship wo n't command me in here ?
Why that 's the very closet !
- I 'm all in an ague !
- Not but I 'm proud of the honour !
[ Enter Innis , out of breath . ]
Innis .
O , my young lady is not here ?
I was just coming to tell about the Ghost .
Miss Exbury .
The Ghost ?
O dear , Mrs. Innis , - do n't say any thing frightful !
Lord Exbury .
Give your account , Mrs. Innis .
Davis .
The Ghost !
I wish to the lord I were at the land 's End !
- at least , as far off as Kensington Gravel Pits !
Litchburn [ trembling ] .
I 'm in such a prodigious shake , I am afraid my Wig will fall off my head !
[ holding on his wig . ]
Sir Archy .
A dispatch from the Ghost ?
Deliver it , I entreat , fair Innis .
My nocturnal recreation gives me a peculiar interest in that business .
Innis .
Why , sir , - why , my lord , - why , ma'am - I 've seen it !
I 've seen it myself !
- Davis .
O lord !
-  have you heard it , too , Mrs. Innis ?
Had it the voice ?
Sir Archy .
And did you approach it , Mrs. Innis ?
Had it the Bludgeon ?
Litchburn .
A fly might knock me plump off my balance !
Innis .
The house-keeper shewed it me herself   there 's the key of the Closet , for who will to look in it .
Litchburn .
Not I , for one , I 'll be bound !
Davis .
Nor I , if I might look till my Eyes turned to diamonds !
Sir Archy [ snatching the key ] .
I 'm the man for that !
[ opens the door . ]
Litchburn [ pulling his Wig over his Eyes ] .
If I see it again , I shall swoon out-right !
Sir Archy .
Here are old trunks  bandboxes to pack up all the Ghosts of Macbeth - but nothing else .
Innis .
Why it 's all a trick , Sir !
all a trick , ma'am !
- nothing else but a trick , to frighten away wickedness .
Davis .
A trick ?
Why then it must have borrowed that 61 voice of forty or fifty devils !
- two or three , at any rate !
Litchburn .
A trick ?
Dear Heart !
I 've pulled my new wig out of curl for nothing !
[ settling his wig . ]
Lord Exbury .
Explain , Mrs. Innis .
Innis .
Why , my lord , the house keeper told me a young Girl belonging to her happenned to be very pretty   so , - people will be wicked , you know , my lord - there 's no help for that !
 so , Mr. Litchburn - All .
Mr. Litchburn !
Mordaunt .
What !
did the Ghost come to take care of the virtue of old Litchburn ?
Miss Exbury .
Old Mr. Litchburn a man of gallantry !
Sir Archy .
Another antediluvian Strephon !
Why I may come  play the lover in these parts any time these thirty years !
Litchburn .
I 'm so astound , I do n't know of a truth whether I a 'n' t in a dream !
- but , if I may be believed , my good lords -  ladies - I had n't so much as cast a glance at a pretty Girl these twenty years !
- Innis .
La , Mr. Litchburn , I do n't know what makes you so quick , but - Litchburn .
I quick ?
Why this is quite the extraordinary of all !
In our whole nelghbourhood , it 's the mode to nominate me the snail !
 what I may have done to the Young Gentlewoman , that she should put all the badness upon me , is more than I can get at the bottom of : - though I hope I do n't so far forget myself as not to know what an honour it is for such a nobody as I am , to be smiled upon by such a company as This !
Innis .
Why I did not mean You , Mr. Litchburn - for all you have not cast a glance at a pretty Girl these twenty years !
- [ courtsying . ]
However , what I was going to say , ma'am , was , that Mr. Litchburn had a young lad that the house-keeper found out was to meet the young Girl , early one morning , in that closet .
So she thought she 'd give him a good cure at once .
So she sent the young Girl out of the way ,  then borrowed a layman - ( 73 ) All .
A layman ?
Innis .
Yes , a layman , of a nephew that was a Painter ,  dressed it up in her late lady 's cloaths .
And That was the Ghost !
which she took away with her privately this morning .
Lord Exbury .
Your walking lady , Davis , will now , I trust , cease to disturb You .
Like all other reported apparitions , it waited but investigation , to be metamorphosed into fraud , or mistake .
Davis .
Well , I can only say - if I did not hear a voice - I 've been out of my head .
[ Exit . ]
Innis [ aside ] .
And if I do n't bring you round again , I shall be out of mme  for I see there 's no good comes of waiting for Young Gentlemen .
[ Exit . ]
Miss Exbury [ aside ] .
Sir Archy behaves so vastly meanly , that I wo n't stay in the room with him .
Not but I 'm extremely rejoiced at it , for , after all , very likely his uncle may recover  -  perhaps his Brother  Sister may both get better  -  nobody can tell but his mother may live these ten years .
[ Exit . ]
Lord Ardville .
And werefore am I condemned - Lord Exbury .
I have other matter , Brother for your Ear ,  - [ A noise is made within the wainscoat . ]
Sir Archy .
Egad , I hear a noise myself , now ?
62 Lord Exbury .
Some rats or mice are playing gambols within the Walls .
Litchburn .
Dear Heart , it 's from the Garden Stair-case !
[ aside . ]
Sir Archy .
I am curious to see farther into this business .
[ They all listen . ]
The sound seems to proceed from within this pannel .
Let 's try if it has any opening .
[ Enter Hilaria , who places herself between Sir Archy ,  the private door . ]
Hilaria .
No , Sir Archy , it has none !
Sir Archy .
Hey day , my fair Cousin ?
Lord Ardville .
Miss Dalton !
Hilaria [ agitated ] .
Do pray go , Sir Archy ?
Sir Archy .
Go ?
 for what reason , my sweet Coz ?
Hilaria .
O , do n't wait asking reasons - I hate reason .
Mordaunt .
I never knew a lady that did not .
Lord Exbury .
Let me beg you , Miss Dalton , to make way ,  suffer me to examine - you tremble ?
- what can disturb you ?
- you change colour ?
- what can thus affect you ?
Surely you are not seriously frightened ?
A Coarse Voice from Within .
You 're somewhere here-abouts , my young ` Squire , I 'll be bound .
Hilaria .
Ah Heaven !
[ The private door is burst open ,  Valentine enters in disorder . ]
Valentine .
Miss Dalton - How ?
Company !
Confusion !
- My Father !
- Good Heaven !
- [ turns round in distress , as if seeking where to hide himself . ]
Lord Exbury .
Valentine !
Lord Ardville .
So !
so !
so !
- but I thought how it was !
I anticipated it exactly .
[ Enter the Strange Man .
He stops  looks warily around him . ]
Hilaria .
Alas !
Strange Man [ laying his hand on Valentine 's Shoulder ] .
O ho , my young sir , I 've catched you at last !
Lord Exbury [ darting forward ,  laying his hand on his other Shoulder ] .
My life is his protection !
What claim , sir , have you upon this Gentleman ?
Bailiff [ taking out a writ ] .
Claim , your worship ?
Ecod , a claim to the tune of five thousand pounds .
Lord Exbury .
What barbarous mystery is unfolding ?
Here , too , must ruin meet me ?
- Valentine !
utter but one word : Is this true ?
- Is it false ?
Valentine [ striking his forehead ] .
Oh God !
Lord Exbury .
He can not answer !
- Tis enough !
[ to the Bailiff ] Sir , do your office !
- [ withdrawing his hand ] I interfere no more .
- He is guilty !
Mordaunt [ suddenly springing from the sofa ] .
He is innocent !
Lord Exbury .
Blessed be those words !
- Mordaunt , I forgive all that is passed !
[ falling on his neck . ]
Mordaunt .
63 Brother Valentine , I feel awakened as from a lethargy by your unexampled generosity .
My lord , I 'll tell you plainly how the matter stands .
A short time ago , I lost , in one night , five thousand pounds , to an old friend who , that same night , after gaining it , lost thirty to another ,  immediately shot himself .
My bond for the five thousand was all he left his widow .
His Executers came upon me , I could produce neither cash nor security   Valentine - to save me - or rather , I believe , You , - the disgrace of an arrest , took the bond , though to the full amount of his fortune , upon himself .
Lord Exbury .
Go on !
- I can not breathe !
Mordaunt .
The affair , however , got buzzed about ,  my Creditors becoming cursed troublesome , the application followed to yourself , which brought us all to this shabby habitation .
But when I tried to have this five thousand consolidated with my general compromize the lady 's agents refused , insisting , since the bond had been transferred to Valentine , he should be responsable for full payment : an event which , I protest , I had not foreseen .
Valentine .
How kind , how seasonable for me , my dear Mordaunt , is the openness of this explanation !
I thankfully accept - but should never have demanded it .
The lady 's claim , however , my lord , seems to me so equitable , that accident alone prevented my immediately setting off for town , to settle the business I had only wished that my Father might not learn my misfortune , till I had entered the army ,  was in the road of Honour for retrieving it .
Lord Exbury .
Son of my cherished hopes !
my prop !
my pride !
Thou art innocent !
- Come to thy Father 's bosom !
- Fortune , I defy thee !
Mordaunt .
I have been the ruin of you all , -  I feel cursed queer .
I 'll go  lie down again .
[ going . ]
Lord Exbury .
Mordaunt !
You could brave the detection of your errors but you blush at being surprised into repentance !
You have strewn , however , some marks of sensibility  return not , then , again , into the nothingness of affected apathy .
Feel for your friends ,  fear not but they will feel for you .
[ Mordaunt abashed , returns to the Sofa . ]
Bailiff .
Well , have you done your palavering ?
( 74 ) Valentine .
I am ready to attend you .
[ Valentine  the Bailiff are retiring . ]
Hilaria [ flying to Lord Ardville ] .
O my lord !
save your noble nephew -  I am yours for-ever !
Lord Ardville .
How , madam !
What !
Valentine [ returning ] .
No !
save me not , my lord !
- I will not be saved !
Lord Exbury .
And can my Brother know my situation , yet suffer him to be torn from me ?
Bailiff .
Come , sir , come !
Hilaria .
I can not bear it !
- Release him , Lord Ardville , - take his bond upon yourself - or let me present him with these jewels -  see behold !
- I offer you my hand !
Valentine .
Take it not , my lord !
- Perdition be my portion if I profit I from such perjured vows !
No , madam , I accept not your boon !
Lord Ardville .
What does all this signify ?
Hilaria [ advancing to Valentine ] .
You wo n't have the Jewels , then ?
Valentine .
No , madam !
Hilaria .
And my lord must not have my hand ?
64 Valentine [ turning away ] .
Inhuman !
Hilaria .
Why , then , - suppose my lord takes the Jewels ,  -  -  - [ hesitating . ]
Lord Exbury .
Valentine the hand ?
[ smiling . ]
Have I finished the phrase rightly ?
Valentine [ returning ] .
Heavens !
Hilaria .
My dear lord Exbury , under your wing I will not blush to be sincere .
Yes , it was Valentine who opened my Eyes to the error of my conduct .
Forgive me , Lord Ardville , that I had ever consented to be yours   bless  thank your nephew that - I retract !
Lord Ardville .
Madam !
Sir Archy .
Off again , Egad !
- A whirlpool is stagnant , compared with a woman !
[ aside . ]
Hilaria .
He has saved You , my lord , from disappointment ,  me from repentance .
He has rescued You from a Wife who might have revelled in all your wealth - without participating in one of your cares !
- might have shared all your honours - yet have fled your society !
- have enjoyed all your luxuries , - yet have shrunk from your affection !
Lord Ardville .
Astonishing !
- But 't is what I have uniformly expected .
Hilaria .
I attempt no apology , my lord - I am too much ashamed .
I only entreat to restore these Jewels .
Lord Ardville .
To whom , madam ?
[ haughtily . ]
Hilaria .
To your lordship .
Lord Ardville .
I comprehend you , madam !
You would teach the World to infer you return a disappointed man his rejected offerings ?
Hilaria .
My lord ?
Lord Ardville .
But you are mistaken , madam .
I had not any design - believe me , - of a personal application .
They were a free gift .
Sir Archy .
A free gift ?
- And the lawyer , my lord , to whom your lordship wrote last night concerning the settlement ?
Lord Ardville .
That , sir , was merely - that was entirely - Sir Archy .
Ah , my lord , human nature , even at its best , has a sad trick of being fallible   your lordship yourself - for once !
- seems to have been tinctured with misapprehension .
Lord Ardville .
I , sir ?
With misapprehension ?
That will be new to me , I confess !
No , sir !
that settlement was meant - believe me , - solely ,  unequivocally - for - for the bride of my nephew Valentine - with whom I have - uniformly - wished Miss Dalton - very happy .
Sir Archy .
My dear lord !
- Lord Ardville .
Sir Archy , you will give me leave , I presume , to know my own purposes ?
I here protest it has been my invariable design to form the establishment of my youngest nephew , upon - upon his alliance with - Miss Dalton .
Sir Archy .
Invariable ?
- Lord Ardville .
No smiling , sir !
- to convince you of the sincerity with which I desire to promote the union , I here take upon myself the discharge of 65 my nephew 's fraternal debt .
- Are you satisfied now , sir ?
or am I still guilty of misapprehension ?
Lord Exbury .
Brother !
[ approaching him ] .
Valentine .
Uncle !
Lord Ardville [ repulsing them ] .
I hate acknowledgements .
All I require is to be vindicated from an imputation so foreign to my character as that of ever framing a design that has proved abortive - a weakness that has never occurred to me yet  - though I can discern , Sir Archy , that you think me - I perceive , indeed , you all around think me - a dupe  a fool !
Sir Archy .
Your lordship 's judgement , is , I own , unerring !
- I submit !
[ bowing . ]
Lord Ardville .
I demand , therefore , to be cleared to the whole World from this unfounded rumour - the origin of which I can only attribute to the officious loquacity of Mr. Litchburn .
Litchburn .
Of me ?
- Dear Heart !
- but I 'd best not speak !
- Lord Ardville .
My resentment , therefore , closes my patronage .
I notice him no more .
Litchburn .
My good lord - but I 'd always better hold my tongue !
- Lord Ardville .
I am much indebted to you , Lord Exbury , for pressing me into this diverting scene , with your Goblins ,  merry sprites :  I beg you to accept my compliments in return - with my warmest wishes - that You  your Ghost - were laid in the red sea together !
[ Exit . ]
[ Lord Exbury whispers the Bailiff , who retires . ]
Litchburn .
Dear Heart !
if this is not the extraordinary of all !
So here I 've been trampled upon all these years for nothing - except just the Honour !
- Mordaunt .
For me - I deserve , I know , to be hanged  -  I feel cursedly ashamed - [ to Lord Exbury ] but if You can forgive the past , I will live upon roots , I will lie upon straw , to acellerate your restoration to your rights .
Lord Exbury .
You restore me those I most prize , my affection  hopes in my son !
[ embraces him . ]
Hilaria [ approaching Lord Exbury ] .
To You , then , my dear lord , let me commit this case , which never can be mine - or never but through your family .
- Lord Exbury .
Valentine !
must all acknowledgement to this generous creature flow solely from me ?
Valentine .
Amazement - admiration -  the acutest sensations , silence - agitate - entrance me !
- But I will not abuse her goodness , her nobleness , No !
- let me fly !
- Lord Exbury .
Valentine , mistake not pride for delicacy .
My Brother , for every reason , will adhere to his declaration   even were it otherwise , your misfortunes have been the result of kindness  generosity , not of extravagance or dishonour .
Upon such falls no shame !
Your character ,  your situation in life , will soon raise you above them .
Is This a Land where spirit  Virtue shall want Protection ?
What is there of Fortune or distinction unattainable in Britain by Talents , probity , c.urage ?
Valentine [ taking his Father 's hand ] .
And you would not deem me base - Hilaria [ speaking over his shoulder ] .
And you do not think me mad - Lord Exbury .
Base ?
- Mad ?
- No !
Has a man hands ,  shall he fear to work for the Wife of his choice ?
Has a Woman a heart -  shall she barter her Person for Gold ?
66 Valentine [ to Hilaria ] .
Dare I then , thus encouraged - Hilaria .
O Valentine , You have drawn me for-ever from the vortex of dissipation  Fashion Valentine .
To fold thee , my Hilaria , in the bosom of conjugal Love !
[ embracing her . ]
Lord Exbury .
Happy be ye both , my dearest Children !
[ throwing his arms round him . ]
Sir Archy .
I have the honour to wish you all much joy .
- So here , with a breath , is her coronet blown to the Winds ,  my Pharo Table to - old Nick !
- for aught I know , Egad , the fittest person to receive it !
[ aside . ]
Litchburn [ sighing deeply ] .
Poor me !
- If I 'd fifty Sons , I 'd bring 'em all up to be Coblers - rather than Dependants - if it were not for the honour !
Lord Exbury .
Mr. Litchburn , do not be dejected .
I shall make it my peculiar business to take care of you .
Litchburn .
Your good lordship ?
- Dear Heart !
And shall I have a patron that will let me say my Soul 's my own ?
Why then , the next time I see my good lord Ardville , I 'll pluck up courage to tell him - at least to give a little - sort of a - kind of a - hint , - respectfully !
[ bowing ] that I begin to think [ smiling ] I know - almost - black from white - humbly craving pardon for the liberty .
Lord Exbury .
And now , my dear Children , let your desires be as moderate as your affections are disinterested -  while Virtue will be the Guardian of Your Union , Felicity will be its recompense .
