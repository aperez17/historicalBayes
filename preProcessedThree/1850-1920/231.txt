CHAPTER I .
THERE was once a little girl who was born with such shining yellow hair that her father and mother said it was as bright as the yellow daffodils , and therefore they gave her the name of Daffodil .
She was born in the dull grey time of the year when all the flowers have gone and the trees are left with only a few wet brown leaves upon them  and her father and mother did not quite remember in their eyes how very bright and how very yellow the daffodils are .
When spring came , they saw that their little one 's beautiful golden hair did not match with the tint of the flower after which they had named her .
But by that time they did not care about her name reminding them of anything but herself .
Daffodil 's father and mother were very kind to her .
When she grew old enough to learn , they used to take a great deal of pains to teach her everything good for a little girl to know , and they explained all so carefully and so pleasantly that she liked some of her lessons , and especially her history , more than any stories , except stories about fairies and mermaids and such people .
But they did not teach her to play  because they did not know how themselves  for page : 2 they were grave very wise people  and , as they did not like her to go with other children , there was nobody to teach her that .
Their house stood by a river and behind it there was a wood : a road through the wood led to a good-sized town , but there were no houses very near .
No one lived in the house with Daffodil and her father and mother but an old woman called Keziah , who generally sat by the kitchen fire warming her wrinkled hands and saying she was worked to death .
So Daffodil could not easily have found children to play with often .
But sometimes she would hear people say to her father and mother `` Do let your child come to the town and have a game of romps with my boys and girls : '' and they said too `` All work and no play make Jack a dull boy . ''
But , when she asked her father why she might never have the game of romps , he told her he wanted to see his little girl grow up thoughtful and good and that some children were not thoughtful and good , and , as he could not tell which were so , he was forced to keep her from them all .
And she remembered that , once , when two little boys who lived in a farmhouse a long way on the other side of the wood were brought to see Keziah , who was their great-aunt , instead of being thoughtful and good they had jeered at her for not knowing how to play , and had dragged her about so rudely , calling it fun , that she was quite frightened  so she thought `` If that is how it is when one plays with other children , my fairies and river people are much nicer companions for me . ''
And , as she found that learning one thing was generally only a way of finding out that there was another thing to be learned , page : 3 so that she suspected there was more to be learned than she could manage even in ten whole years , she did not feel afraid of growing too clever even by a quarter .
And as , besides , she was not a boy and she never did anything you could call work , there must , she considered , be some mistake about that reason for her going to the town for a game of romps .
Daffodil had not really any fairies or river people to play with her at this time .
But , when Keziah had got herself well warmed and was in a good humour , she would talk to the little girl in a very interesting way about the elf world and its various tribes .
Keziah was a well-informed woman and knew a great deal about the laws and customs of all these , and Daffodil was never weary of listening to her accounts of them .
Daffodil 's father and mother always said that Keziah had not trustworthy authority for her statements  and they themselves , after much study and research , had come to the conclusion that the elf world with all belonging to it was nothing but nonsense , or imagination , which , as you may have heard , is the same thing .
But that came from their being philosophers - persons of whom all the elfin peoples stand in so much dread that they take every possible means of concealing from them all traces of their existence .
This is because they believe that , if the philosophers were to catch them , they would put them through a competitive examination : just as we believe that no ogre can resist the temptation of munching and crunching any boy or girl he may be able to seize .
Daffodil was fond of telling fairy tales as well as of hearing them .
But there was a difficulty about page : 4 finding any one to whom to tell them .
Keziah would not listen to them at all , because they were not true fact stories , but only what came into Daffodil 's head , and she said an old woman like her could not waste her poor bit of hearing upon make-believes .
However , Daffodil had a very large grave black dog and a fat grave white cat to keep her company , and , as they were not so particular as Keziah , she sometimes told them her stories .
But the cat used to go to sleep over them , and if they were very long the dog would whine and fidget , and Daffodil was afraid he must feel as she once did when she was taken to a lecture on astronomy in which all the words were too hard for her to make out and she was not allowed to go to sleep like the cat .
On the whole the best way for enjoying her make-believes , as Keziah called them , was to sit looking into the river or up at the sailing clouds and let it seem as if it were the river or the clouds that showed her the stories and she had nothing to do with making them up .
Now , though Daffodil did not know it , this is the sure way to get into the good graces of the elfin people and make them willing to admit you to their acquaintance .
But it is not always a safe plan , for they may thus get power over you before you are aware , and , as they are some good and some bad , as men and women are , that is running too much risk .
And , if Daffodil had been a child who thought unholy and unkind thoughts , certainly more harm would have come of it than did come .
What happened was that the river people took a liking to her and that , while she was sitting near the river , letting the page : 5 stories come to her , they would be singing to her a kind of sleepy song - a song with no words to it and no tune , and yet it was a song  and she would hear it without even knowing that she heard , but it drew her heart more and more to the river people .
In a little while after they began doing this she quite left off looking at the clouds , and she used to lie down on the grass with her face leaning over the bank so that she could see into the water , and keep trying to fancy what the river people 's bowers were like  and sometimes she would half close her eyes so that she saw the reflections and the green shadows of the trees , not clear and distinct as they really were , but in an uncertain way , that she might think them bowers underneath the water  and the more she did this the sweeter and the sleepier the song came to her , and the more her heart was drawn to the river people .
The river people did this without any plan : it was only their way of showing approbation , and they did not design to entice her to them .
Indeed the possibility of such a thing was not generally believed among them .
There were traditions of mortals having been attracted down to their abodes , but there was no authoritative historic evidence of any such occurrence .
Moreover many of the river people disputed the existence of human beings , saying they were only the fantastic creations of the brain .
Of course those who sang to Daffodil knew better than that .
But the river people do not leave home much , and some of Daffodil 's friends ' tribe who lived in the middle of the wood far from all houses had never had an opportunity of seeing a human being .
And , among river peoples and other fairies , there are some page : 6 so constituted that they are not aware of the presence of human beings , even when close by them .
The number of those who are destitute of the faculty by which fairies and mortals are capable of perceiving each other increases so fast that in a thousand years or so this faculty will be as rare in the elf world as it has already become in ours .
And , although Daffodil 's river friends did possess the faculty , they , from the reasons I have pointed out , were without any information as to the modes of communication between fairies and human kind and the influence they themselves were exerting .
It was in the summer the river people began to sing to Daffodil , and , by the time the leaves were turning amber and red on their boughs , she had grown to think there could be no happiness out of heaven so great and delightful as there must be under the water with them .
By and by the leaves grew brown and shrivelled and lay on the ground in dank heaps and blew about uncomfortably , and the sky was all one dull lead-coloured cloud and came so low that it seemed as if the world had grown smaller since the summer .
The song of the river people had quite left off , but Daffodil still used to sit looking into the water , thinking about the pleasant regions below .
It seemed dreary round her , and now she began to find it dull to have no one to go about with in her play-hours but the grave dog and the grave cat .
But it was not for the company of other children she longed  it was for the river maidens to dance and sing with her and teach her to float through the waters .
She asked her father and mother whether they would object to her page : 7 making friends with the river people , if she should see any , and they smiled , and gave her leave to do so .
She might play with all the fairies she met , they said , only they must decidedly object to her forming any acquaintance with Will-o ' - the-wisp , whom she had once seen beckoning to her with his lamp .
Daffodil agreed quite cheerfully to that for she knew Will-o ' - the-wisp was an injudicious sort of person who would be sure to lead her into scrapes .
Now that she had her parents ' leave , she looked about eagerly for some way of beginning the acquaintance .
Sometimes she would call softly into the water `` River people , dear river people , I want so much to know you , and my father and mother have given me leave .
Wo n't you come up and talk to me ? ''
And sometimes she would throw an apple or a very pretty pebble into the water , and say `` This is Daffodil 's present to the river people , with her love . ''
And she hunted several days for a four-leaved shamrock , because Keziah had told her you can do a great many fairy spells , if you have one , and she thought she should be able to make a spell that would persuade one of the river people to come to her .
But , when she had found a four-leaved shamrock , Keziah could not remember what was the way to use it , and so all her pains were thrown away .
One day she chanced to find a funny little thing growing out of the stump of a felled tree - a tiny scarlet cup with a sort of saucer of crimson petals : it seemed neither quite a flower nor quite a fungus .
When she picked it , it made a little noise like a mouse squeaking a long way off , and very much page : 8 surprised , she took it to Keziah .
`` It is so odd , '' she said , `` that I ca n't help thinking it must have something to do with the fairies . ''
Keziah peered at it with her old purblind eyes , and pinched it , and smelt it over and over again , for it had no smell at all .
`` Aye , aye , '' she said at last , `` it 's what I thought .
Now , if you did but know what day of the year and month and week it was when that tree was felled , you 'd be in luck , child  for you 'd only have to jump into the river from off that tree-stump the same day of the year and month and week , and water could n't drown you , but you 'd get down among the river people you talk so much about , and have power over them so that they 'd be forced to let you come back whenever you liked . ''
When she had said this , she was going to throw the elf-cup into the fire , for she thought it was of no use , as they did not know the day the tree was felled .
But Daffodil cried out `` Oh do n't , please , '' in a great hurry , for she was sure she could find out .
Her father had a book in which he wrote down every day what had happened , and she took it that such an important happening as a tree being cut down must be written in the book .
She ran at once to ask .
`` What can you want to know that for ? ''
her father said , quite astonished .
And her mother took off her spectacles , so that she might be able to look at her better , and gazed inquiringly .
`` Because , if I knew that , there is a way I could get to know the river people at once , if you and mother will give me leave , '' said Daffodil , almost breathless with eagerness .
page : 9 `` Oh , very well , '' said her father , `` that is important , and I will look at once , so that no time may be lost . ''
He got his book and , after he had searched a long time , he said `` My little day-dreamer , that tree was felled on Monday , the first of December , the year you were born . ''
`` Why !
that makes it come right to-day ! ''
screamed Daffodil , in an ecstasy of joy , `` This is a Monday , and it is the first of December ! ''
And she ran off in such haste that she forgot to say `` thank you '' to her father for the trouble he had taken for her .
Presently her father , who had gone on looking through the book , said to her mother `` I have told our little woman the wrong day of the week , I see .
The first of December was a Tuesday the year that tree was felled .
Luckily not much harm can come of that mistake . ''
`` Monday will do just as well till you see her again , '' said her mother .
`` She will be as happy over her calculations as if she had got the right day to count from . ''
Of course neither of them had the least notion that there was anything about jumping into the water in the plan for knowing the river people Daffodil was going to try .
And , as they did not believe that there were river people at all , they did not think the day of the week would make any difference to her chance of forming an acquaintance with them .
When it was dinner time , lo and behold , there was no Daffodil to be found !
You may imagine what a calling and searching there was .
But , call page : 10 and search as they would , there was no trace of the child .
Only , the white cat was crying on the top of the stump where Daffodil had found the elf-cup , and beside her on the river bank was the big black dog with his hair wet , giving a little whine every now and then , but never moving , and all the while staring hard at the water , as if he were expecting to see something that he knew was in it .
And , when Keziah saw that , she knew Daffodil must have jumped into the river to find the river people , and she told the father and mother , to comfort them .
Then they understood why the dog was so wet and still kept watching .
It was easy to see that he had jumped in to catch Daffodil , and that he had not succeeded .
I will not tell you what weeping and lamenting there was for Daffodil .
Keziah , of course , had not been much disturbed at first , as she thought Daffodil had ascertained the right date and would come back by bedtime  but she soon learned the mistake that had been made .
She tried to keep up a hope that the poor child must have reached the river people safely with her elf-cup , in spite of the day of the week being wrong , and that some time she might get leave to come back  but the father and the mother were certain she was drowned .
You may imagine how unhappy they were .
And you may imagine too what care they took of the good dog who tried to get their dear daughter back from the river for them .
The cat too was made much of for the good feeling she had shown .
But what they found difficult was to forgive Keziah , for they looked on what she had told Daffodil about the elf-cup as page : 11 the cause of Daffodil 's death .
However , when they saw how grieved she was - so grieved that she even left off grumbling - they agreed that they must be gentle to her and never reproach her .
Keziah , on her side , seeing how heavily their carelessness , as she considered it , had been punished , scarcely ever found fault with them for , first , making the mistake , and , next , not hurrying with all their might to correct it .
But she was very angry , once , when a pedlar to whom she was talking about the sorrowful story took their part about that piece of carelessness and said the mistake was not of consequence .
`` Not of consequence ! ''
cried Keziah .
`` The drowning of the best behaved little girl in the world not of consequence !!! ''
and she opened the kitchen door wide , with a bang , and made him walk out so fast that she had to throw his pack , and all the things he had taken from it to show her , out into the snow after him .
page : 12 CHAPTER II .
ALMOST the moment Daffodil sprang into the water , she felt the dog close upon her .
He all but caught her  indeed he just reached her floating hair with his nose and nearly seized it  but she sank , her feet touched the bottom , it gave way beneath her , and down , down , she went through soft thick mud , so that , if she had not covered her face with her hands and her apron , her eyes and nose and mouth would have been quite choked up .
In a few seconds - only it seemed much longer to her - she felt firm footing .
But she did not consider that much was gained by that  for what was the use of standing in that horrible mud , which would most likely stifle her presently ?
So she stamped about to see if she could get farther down : for getting up through the mud was quite hopeless .
And , all at once , something gave way with a loud crash and clatter , and down she fell , head over heels , too fast to leave her time to know she was falling till it was over .
The next thing was that she was lying on a soft wet floor of some sort of moss or grass , with the fragments of the roof and ceiling from where she had broken through lying about her , pell-mell .
page : 13 She picked herself up , and jumped about to see if she was hurt anywhere  which she was very much pleased to find she was not .
Then she observed how terribly dirty her clothes and her hands had got , and she felt sure her face must be as bad .
She could hardly help crying at this disaster , for she heard sounds of running about and calling which seemed getting nearer , and she was sure the river people had heard the noise of her fall and would come upon her in a moment .
Probably they would excuse her having broken their ceiling , as she could not know it was there when she stamped on it , but how could they be expected to be glad to see a visitor in so unpresentable a condition - all over greasy black mud ?
And the worst was that some of it was dripping from her and soiling the beautiful green floor .
She was in a large room , as large as a church , only not so high for its length as we think suitable for great buildings .
Its walls were built in a curve , so that you could not say where they left off and the ceiling began  it was just as if the room had been made out of the hollowed half of an enormous ball .
And its doorways , of which there were too many to count just then , were semicircular too .
All over the walls there grew , where we put papering , a delicate covering that looked like chickweed spotted in various patterns with forget-me-nots around white or yellow water-lilies .
Towards the top of the ball began long waving grasses and water-plants , getting longer and closer together the higher up they were , till they knotted themselves in tangles overhead and their long leaves hung page : 14 gracefully downwards - but there was a sad gap where Daffodil had tumbled through .
The drooping leaves were bright with sparkling drops of water that kept trickling down on to the floor  and the chickweed and lilies and forget-me-nots were all glistening with wet .
Right round the room was a canal of clear greenish water , exactly like the phosphorescent sea that shows such a wonderful gold-green light when the oars dip into it on dark nights : and it was this canal which lighted the room .
It was bordered with lilies and forget-me-nots in a pattern something like the wall patterns , but there were rich red flowers mixed among them .
The whole of the room was carpeted with the soft wet moss on which Daffodil had fallen .
It was an odd sort of floor , for it seemed to have water under it and it shook at every step she took , so that she was afraid it would give way beneath her : but it was quite secure , and was very nice for people who did not mind wet feet .
There were about the room chairs and tables and couches , which all seemed made of the same kind of material as the floor , and which had growing upon them patterns in flowers or in differently tinted leaves and mosses : and , in the centre of the room , just under the greatest drip from the leaves in the ceiling , there were raised steps , with seats on each step but the lowest , and on the highest step of all two larger seats which seemed meant for thrones .
It was a most magnificent apartment , and Daffodil was shocked at having so damaged it by her manner of entering it .
She had not much time to reflect upon that , however .
On every side there was a pattering and page : 15 scuffling and slopping sound of steps , and nearer and nearer came a noise like shouting and coughing and sneezing all in one : people seemed to be calling to each other in this extraordinary fashion .
There were no doors to the doorways , and Daffodil saw through three entrances at once a rush of strange-looking creatures with such bright large eyes that , in her alarm , she seemed to see nothing but eyes .
For a moment it crossed her mind that they would not be able to get at her , because of the canal : but then she remembered that they would not have built a room into which you could only get through the roof , and she gave herself up for lost .
But , to her amazement , as soon as they caught sight of her , they stopped short in the archways , huddling together as if they were in a terrible fright , and some of them turned right round and began pushing at the others in order to break through them and run away : so there was a great hubbub and confusion .
And presently they had all scuffled away , and she could hear them making a noise as if they were discussing what they must do .
Every now and then one or two would come and peep at her stealthily from the archways  and she noticed that they seemed a little bolder each time , so she felt sure that they would soon decide on facing her again .
However , she began to feel less frightened , for she had become certain that these creatures , though they were very much larger than any frogs she had ever seen or heard of , and walked , or rather waddled , upright , and wore bright-coloured garments on their bodies , were nothing but great green and yellow frogs .
page : 16 `` Frogs are not beasts of prey , '' she said to herself , `` and have not sharp claws and teeth : they can not do me much harm .
And they do not look ill-tempered , either : if I can only make them understand that my coming through their roof was an unexpected accident , perhaps they will excuse it . ''
So the next time one of the frogs peeped at her she smiled and nodded to him , and pointed to the hole in the ceiling and to the fragments on the ground , and tried to make him understand by signs how sorry she was .
The frog stared at her , and , after a little , he seemed to get some notion of what she meant , for he nodded to her and made signs as if he meant to ask if she had fallen through , and then called out something to her .
But what it was Daffodil could not make out , for it seemed to her like `` Chrchrkkerkeckkeckghrchr . ''
He said it twice and seemed to expect an answer , and so Daffodil replied , as politely as she could , `` I am sorry I do not understand Froggais , Sir . ''
She thought that would the the proper name to call his language , because , as FranÁais is the name of the language they speak in France .
Froggais seemed the same sort of word for the language they speak in Frogland .
The frog looked , and shook his head , then ran away .
Presently more frogs came and questioned in signs , and Daffodil answered in signs : then they spoke , and Daffodil answered as she had to the first frog .
Then they went away and others came , and it all had to be done over again .
And then others came , and others , until Daffodil grew tired .
But she thought it would be rude to show it , and she went on answering them in the same fashion .
page : 17 At last she heard advancing from several sides at once a sort of flop-flop , slop-slop , which she knew must be the sound of frog feet walking together in a measured quick time .
And presently , and all at the same moment - such was the beautiful precision into which the frog army was drilled-there appeared at each entrance the head of a column of soldiers .
The soldiers were dressed in short yellow tunics spotted with orange , with broad belts of plaited rushes from which hung swords made of fish-bones of a glittering whiteness .
They wore also short leggings , which Daffodil thought looked quite like crimson bell-flowers , fringed at the edge .
And it is no wonder that they looked so , for that is just what they were , though she did not know it then .
Their arms and feet were bare like those of the other frogs she had just seen , but , while the other frogs were bare-headed , these wore helmets plaited to match their belts , with a brown tuft on the top .
Their helmets seemed rather uncomfortable head-dresses for them , as they were always tumbling over their eyes and noses , and Daffodil wondered that they did not take them off and throw them away , for she did not know that the best military authorities have always decided that a soldier should have at least one part of his uniform exceedingly inconvenient .
They had rush straps across their chests , in which were secured fish-bone weapons pointed like lances at one end and , at the other , club-shape with a small stone in a socket of the bone : these rested on their shoulders .
They had nothing in their hands as they marched , and they kept them crossed on their breasts .
The frog page : 18 recruits always find it very difficult to learn to do this  because the frogs who are not soldiers are accustomed to use their arms ( which we call their forelegs ) to balance themselves as they walk .
The recruits keep tumbling down when they first try to do without this assistance , and it takes several years for them to acquire the art of moving steadily on their hindlegs when their forelegs are folded over the breast .
But the regiment sent against Daffodil was composed of veteran soldiers , and their gait was quite erect and even , unless they tried to go very fast .
The reason they had been so long in coming was not , however , only that they could not go very fast .
It is not the custom for them ever to wear the same uniform twice , and , as they had not expected to be called out on active service that day , their tunics were not ready .
Some too suspicious frogs afterwards accused them of cowardice for not confronting the invader more speedily  but that was not fair .
The yellow tunics were not made of a common flower and could not be found in a moment for a whole regiment .
Daffodil had plenty of time to observe her assailants , for they had many military movements to execute before they could close upon her properly .
First the word of command was given for the columns to halt in the entrances  then they fell in and fell out and formed into triangles and circles a great many times  and then each column arranged itself into a sort of curl twisted round and round .
Then the word was given and the outer frog of each curl plunged into the canal , all in the same half - page : 19 second , then the second outer frog of each curl , and so they went on , the curls unwinding by degrees , until every flog had crossed the canal .
And they did this so beautifully that the tenths and twentieths and fiftieths and hundredths and so on of each curl crossed precisely at the same moment , up to the very last of all .
The outer flog of each curl had now become the innermost of the curl newly formed , each frog , as he crossed , turning the proper way to keep the curve perfect .
Then they all fell in and fell out and marched and halted all about the border of the canal until all the curls had joined together .
And then they went on wheeling round and round till at last there was one great curl with Daffodil inside the head of it .
This manœuvre having been so successfully accomplished , the Officer in Command , who was the innermost frog of the curl , advanced resolutely and summoned Daffodil to surrender .
He was not so tall as most of his regiment , so that he did not quite reach to her shoulder , but he was very fat and broad and looked extremely dignified  so Daffodil made him the most respectful curtsey she could .
As she did not understand what he said , she did not make any remark in reply , but the Officer in Command accepted her curtsey as a token of submission .
He turned to his men and made a short speech .
`` Brave soldiers , '' he said , `` we have conquered .
All honour to your dauntless hearts : I am proud of you . ''
`` And we of you , and we of you , '' shouted the soldiers , taking advantage of a slight pause in the speech .
page : 20 `` Hush , my brave soldiers , '' said the Officer in Command , `` you interrupt .
I forgive you  it is the truthful fervour of your honest minds that forces you to speak  but no more .
I resume .
We have conquered , brave soldiers .
The enemy surrenders .
We will be merciful , as becomes soldiers and frogs . ''
Then all the frog soldiers hurrahed and waved their swords , and there was such a din that Daffodil was quite terrified , thinking they were going to rush upon her at once and make an end of her .
When quiet was restored , six soldiers advanced and stood round her , pointing their lances at her to warn her not to resist .
Two others secured her hands behind her back with their belts .
Then twenty picked frogs were told off to remain with her as a guard , and the Officer in Command directed the Officer Next in Command to march the troops back to their barracks .
He decided to go home himself to write his report to the King  but first he sent his Aide-de-camp to tell Their Majesties everything that had happened .
The King was asleep when the messenger came , but the Queen , on hearing the narrative , felt so curious to see the prisoner , that , when she was assured it was quite safe , she resolved to go herself to the Great Throne Hall , the room into which Daffodil had tumbled .
The Officer in Command , after giving precise instructions to the guard about the necessary precautions in case of any attempt of the enemy at a surprise , was just leaving the Hall , muttering to himself the first paragraph of the report , when he saw Her Majesty enter , with her Royal Mantle all crooked from the haste with which page : 21 she had put it on , with only her third best crown that she kept for indoors wear when she did not expect to see any visitors , and attended by not more than a dozen Lords and Ladies in Waiting .
So great had been her Royal haste .
He flopped hurriedly to the door to receive her .
And the Queen , in the most gracious manner , said to him `` Brave as ever , Sir Ghxrrschcroxbog .
Accept our Royal thanks , His Majesty 's and mine . ''
But the Officer in Command looked terribly disappointed , for he had expected to be promised a peerage .
However , he made the best of it and replied , with a tremendously low bow , that no reward that could have been given him would have been worth those words from Her Majesty .
`` I should think so , indeed , '' said the Queen .
`` And now , have the prisoner brought forward . ''
So the Officer in Command flopped backwards to the end of the Hall where Daffodil was being kept in custody , and , at his order , the twenty guards marched her up to the Queen , and then fell back respectfully .
Daffodil , perceiving by the crown , though it was rather a shabby one , that she was in the presence of Royalty , was so impressed that she managed to make a yet lower curtsey than she had made to the Officer in Command  at which the Queen was pleased , for she had never seen curtseying before and she thought it looked extremely loyal .
The frogs ' way of bowing and curtseying to Royalty is to hop three times round It .
They hop twice round a superior below Royal rank , or to a distant acquaintance , and once round a familiar acquaintance .
The Queen spoke to Daffodil , but Daffodil could page : 22 only say `` If you please , I am sorry , but I do n't know Froggais . ''
Now the Queen had been instructed by the Regius Professor of Everything and was the most learned woman in Croäxaxica , which is the native name for Frogland .
She desired one of the soldiers to turn the prisoner slowly round several times that she might view the creature thoroughly .
Then she leant her head on her hand and remained in deep thought for ten minutes , while , for fear of disturbing her reflections , the Lords and Ladies in Waiting and the Officer in Command and the soldiers stood as mute and motionless as statues , trying not to breathe .
`` The thing is a human being , '' said the Queen , at last .
`` Get me the Treatise on the Modes of Articulation , Pronunciations , and Dialects of the Inferior Races , with Glossary and Directions for Imitating the various Pronunciations . ''
An attendant rushed off obediently , and soon returned with the book .
It was not quite like one of our books .
Its leaves , which were of two different tints , white and yellow alternately , were thick and waxy-looking , and were rounded off instead of having straight lines and corners like ours .
They were , in fact , the petals of large flowers of the water-lily kind which are especially cultivated for writing and printing on .
The printing is done by pointed implements with which the letters are pricked in .
These implements are long and sharp , so that many leaves at a time can be pricked through by them .
Only one side of a leaf is used : the lines are arranged rather far apart and care is taken in the binding that the pricks on one leaf shall not lie upon the pricks on the next leaf but shall be just over the page : 23 smooth part between the lines , so that the yellow leaves shall show through the pricked lines of white leaves and the white leaves through the pricked lines of yellow leaves .
Sometimes green leaves are used instead of yellow  but the yellow are considered the best and cost the most , so , of course , the Queen had yellow .
The binding of Croäxaxican books is sometimes very elaborate .
This one , which had been presented to the Queen by its author , the Regius Professor of Everything , had for cover the petals of a crimson lily of the same nature as that of which its leaves were made , but much thicker : the cover was adorned with a mosaic pattern in small white , blue , and gold-coloured petals .
And , as the book had just been taken out of the water , it glistened all over .
The Croäxaxican bookshelves are cut in the ground like drains , and are always kept full of water .
The books are arranged in them side by side , as we place ours , only that they do not stand upright : it is as if we laid our bookshelves on the ground instead of setting them up against the walls .
Care is taken to arrange the books according to their sizes and to keep them level , and they make a very handsome floor .
Of course no furniture is stood on them .
And the Croäxaxicans do not tread upon them , but hop gently over from step to step of the moss partitions between them .
These partition-strips of moss are made wide enough for a frog to stand on them and get out a book comfortably .
In the Royal Library they are so wide that there is room on them for seats and couches and writing-tables , which is a very pleasant and convenient arrangement .
page : 24 The Queen took her book and turned to the part `` On the Dialect of Human Beings . ''
And first , as there was a short introduction describing the appearance of human beings , she compared Daffodil with the description .
`` An odd-looking tangled tuft of coloured rushes growing on the head - very long in the female , '' she said .
`` Quite so .
This is a female .
Look at the tangled rushes .
I suppose they were green in the summer . ''
`` Fleshy red mouths which do not reach across the face , but , stopping short as it were half way , give them a ridiculous appearance , '' she read again .
`` Just so .
Look how absurd it is : her mouth stops short just under that knob over the nostrils .
And the knob - yes the book says human beings all have that strange excrescence . ''
All the attendants said `` Your Majesty is evidently right , as usual .
This is a human being . ''
And they whispered to each other in very loud whispers `` Is it not wonderful ?
She knows everything !
She knows more even than the Regius Professor of Everything ! ''
Every one was in such a hurry to whisper it first that they were all whispering at once , so that there was a rustling sound like the surge among the rushes on a windy day .
But the Queen said `` Hush ! ''
for she wanted to read over the rules of pronunciation , which she had a little forgotten , although she had once read some of them some years before .
She read them for twenty minutes , in the midst of a profound silence .
Then she said to Daffodil `` Ghxoogh Ghxar Ghxooghxxxxh ? ''
That puzzled Daffodil very much , and she could only reply by making a curtsey and shaking her page : 25 head hard .
So the Queen read her book for thirty minutes more , and then she said `` Ghxoogh Ghar Ghxooghxxxh ? ''
And Daffodil curtseyed , and shook her head harder .
Then the Queen read her book for three-quarters of an hour .
And at the end of that time she looked up , and said exactly the same as she had before .
Daffodil was luckier this time .
She made out that the Queen was saying `` Who are you ? ''
So with a deeper curtsey than ever , for she saw that the Queen approved of her curtseys , she answered `` If you please I am Daffodil .
And my breaking the roof was not my fault I do assure you , please Your Majesty .
When I was in the mud I could not help kicking to try to get out , and I would not have broken your beautiful ceiling on any account if I had known it was there . ''
The Queen looked bewildered .
`` Ghxxayitxhxxagainxgh '' she said , and Daffodil understood that she was to repeat her speech .
So she said the very same words as before , and tried to pronounce them very distinctly .
And the Queen put her hand behind her right ear and leant forward listening attentively .
`` Ghxxayitxghxxxagainxgh '' she replied when Daffodil had finished .
And Daffodil said it again very slowly and carefully .
This time the Queen did not tell her to repeat it .
But she remained silent for ten minutes looking very puzzled .
Then she put her paws to her ears and said to her attendants `` Oh !
it goes through my head !
I can not endure this poor creature 's discordant noise any longer .
It is too painful ! ''
page : 26 And all the attendants and the Officer in Command and the twenty soldiers put their hands to their ears .
And the attendants and the Officer in Command all said `` It is too painful , too painful . ''
The soldiers all shook their heads slowly : it was not allowable for them to speak .
`` There is only one thing to be done , '' said the Queen .
`` It must be confined in the State Prison for two or three days , and the Regius Professor of Everything must be sent to it .
Let me see - this is Monday : I order that it shall talk reasonably by Thursday .
Then we will have a Drawing-room , and it will be a treat for you all to hear me examine it . ''
`` What a delightful plan !
How profound !
How judicious !
How diplomatic ! ''
they all said .
And Daffodil was marched off at once to the State Prison .
page : 27 CHAPTER III .
THE Queen was so pleased with Daffodil 's curtseys that she sent special orders to the Lieutenant of the State Prison to treat the prisoner with kindness .
Therefore , as soon as this important prisoner had been delivered into his custody with the due formalities , he placed her in the best room in the prison - the one into which it was usual to put any great Court official who might have the misfortune to mistake Their Majesties ' wish and be ordered into temporary confinement .
This room was constructed in the same kind of way as the Great Throne Hall , but , naturally , it was very much smaller , and it was much lower in proportion : Daffodil could have touched the ceiling with her head , if she had given a jump with all her might .
It was oval instead of round , and the water which lighted it only went half round it and was of a golden-brown colour instead of the wonderful green of the Great Throne Hall canal , and its border was only of simple meadow-sweet .
The floors were of a somewhat coarser moss and not quite so wet , and the walls were merely of chickweed without any but its own flowers .
There was , however , an oval wreath of small yellow water - page : 28 lilies growing on the ceiling , and , in the centre of them , a tuft of water-plants with long leaves which dripped down water .
The furniture was of the same kind as that in the Throne Hall but less decorated .
On the whole , this was much such a room as you would find for the principal reception room in the house of a Croäxaxican gentleman of easy but not extensive fortune .
A sleeping closet opened out of this room .
It was of the same shape , but barely long enough for Daffodil to lie down in , and even a Croäxaxican could not have stood upright in it .
It had no water to light it , and was nearly all taken up by a moss and water bed on which lay a counterpane of bog cotton plaited together and , for ornament , dotted at the joins with the little brown tufts of bulrushes .
Daffodil looked disconsolately at this bedroom : it seemed to her a dismal kind of sleeping place , though it was just as the most luxurious Croäxaxicans had their own .
The sole difference between it and the Royal Bedroom itself was that the Royal Counterpane was trimmed every day with fresh forget-me-nots .
A thing which disturbed her greatly was that there was no wash-handstand .
And really it was very unpleasant to have such muddy hands .
She looked wistfully at the water in her sitting-room : she was afraid she should get into trouble if she took the liberty of puddling it with her dirty hands , but there seemed no other resource and she felt tempted to try .
At last she dabbled one hand in it : in doing so she made a little splashing sound , and , in a moment , a sentry , of whose vicinity she page : 29 had not been aware , came marching up to the doorway .
To prevent escapes , there was only one entrance to this apartment , and , out of consideration for the prisoners , the corridor leading to it was made to curve away from it , so that the sentry could be placed in such a way as to guard the room without going into it .
But a splash is the same sort of signal among the Croäxaxicans as ringing a bell is for us , and , as they have no objection to taking a bath before spectators , it was customary for the sentry , when he had come to answer a splash , to remain in the doorway , if he found the prisoner in the water , in case he should be wanted .
For , of course , while the splashing of a bath was going on , the sentry had no way of knowing if he was wanted unless he remained in sight .
The sentry did not look at all put out by seeing Daffodil dabbling her muddy hand in the canal , and , when she put her other hand in and looked inquiringly , he nodded .
Then , when he saw that she only washed her hands and did not get in , he came forward and pointed to the water and made signs , so that at last she understood that she might take a bath if she liked .
She was glad of that , you may be sure , and , going into her bedroom , she began to undress .
But , when she put out her head , she saw that the sentry intended to remain in the doorway .
So she put her pinafore on again , and , thinking it was the only way to get clean and that she was so wet already and everything round her so damp and dripping that sousing her clothes could not matter , she plunged , just as she was , into the water .
She page : 30 was a little startled when she found that it was deep enough to come up to her neck , but she quickly got over her first alarm and splashed and floundered so long that she got her hands the very next thing to clean .
The sentry looked on , very much surprised that she did not swim about quietly as he would have done , instead of making all these antics , but he did not interfere , though she was spoiling the water sadly .
When she got out at last , he went to the canal , and , removing some sods and stones at one end , let all the water run out  then , going into the bedroom , he moved some sods and stones there , so that a gush of water burst out and , filling the bedroom , overflowed into the canal and made it just as it had been before Daffodil 's bath .
The counterpane was soaked through , of course , and the moss bed still wetter than she found it , but the sentry did not know that she would not think them all the better , as a Croäxaxican would have done .
Daffodil was sorry to have given her keeper so much trouble , and tried to apologise to him .
But he good-humouredly hopped once round her and withdrew to his post in the corridor .
In a few minutes he came back , escorting the Regius Professor of Everything , who had just arrived .
Two frogs in the Royal Livery of green and orange followed , carrying each a pile of books on a tray of plaited rushes .
These they carefully placed under the drip from the ceiling , and , after hopping twice round the Professor and turning up their noses at Daffodil , they withdrew in a lofty manner .
The sentry , on a sign from the Professor , withdrew to his page : 31 post , after making a military obeisance which the Professor returned by a slight but kindly hop .
The Regius Professor of Everything was a short thin frog of a pensive and melancholy expression of countenance .
He was by nature cheerful , but laughing is not professorial and therefore he had always to be remarkably serious , and the habit of drawing down the corners of his mouth , to avoid smiling , had finally stiffened them in a downwards curve , so that no Professor of any country has ever surpassed him in a sad and ponderous aspect .
He was dressed in brown spotted with black , and he wore spectacles with handsome broad rims of interwoven fish-bones , which made his eyes look extra round and staring .
Among the Croäxaxicans round and staring eyes are considered a sign of intellect .
A low forehead is another sign of intellect , and the Professor 's was so low that his friends said he had none at all .
The Professor drew a seat close to Daffodil 's , and sat , with his hands on his knees , staring into her face till she felt quite uncomfortable .
Then he said `` Xspeakgh . ''
Daffodil , much pleased that she could understand him , began `` If you please , sir , I am so sorry I broke the roof .
It was quite by accident . ''
`` Xstopgh , '' said the Professor .
He cleared his throat - which alarmed Daffodil no little , for she imagined that he was choking or scolding or both - he wetted his spectacles on the moss , and began .
`` I have not authority to enter with you into questions of State .
Her Majesty has commissioned me to tutor you into such approximation to the page : 32 correct mellifluous and harmonious pronunciation to which we favoured children of nature , the inimitable Croäxaxicans , are habituated , as may enable her Royal Ears to tolerate your answers to her Majestic inquiries .
Let us commence our studies . ''
Only , although he believed that he was speaking exactly as Daffodil spoke , he could not help before and after every word a little sound of the Croäxaxican throat letters - which we can most nearly express in writing by repeated Gh 's , Xh 's and X 's - and Daffodil could hardly understand him .
`` Let us commence our studies , '' resumed the Professor , after having again solemnly wetted his spectacles .
`` And first I will , continuing to condescend to your own uncouth and , to me , degrading mode of pronunciation , extemporise to you a preliminary lecture on the origin of language . ''
But , just then , in came two servants who began laying the cloth for a meal .
The tablecloth was made of the finest bog cotton plaited into patterns  and Daffodil particularly admired the plates and dishes , which were of a mosaic work of shell and mother-of-pearl , and the drinking-cups , which were a single white or blue shell .
But she was surprised at seeing no forks , only knives , cut from the same large kind of fish-bone as the soldiers ' swords , and mother-of-pearl spoons , or rather ladles , very wide in the bowls and short in the handles .
The Croäxaxicans do not use forks but put their food into their mouths by means of these spoons , which are made of a shape and size to fit them .
The servants were quick with their work , and the first course was soon on the table .
The Regius page : 33 Professor of Everything offered Daffodil his arm , and they took their places opposite each other .
Daffodil was hungry  she had had nothing to eat since breakfast , and that was a long time ago now  and she could not help feeling disappointed to see nothing but water-cresses before her .
However , she was glad to help herself to a few , when one of the servants handed them .
But the Professor immediately ordered her plate to be taken away , and told her she must on no account taste one leaf of watercress at that time .
Water-cresses , he said , excited the brain , and what would presently be necessary for her was quiet persistent and passive attention .
From him , as teacher , he said , energy and effort would be required , and the water-cresses were suitable , and even desirable , for him : as a proof of his wish to spend himself to the utmost in the lesson he was about to give her , he would eat them to the last stalk .
And he did .
Daffodil watched the process , which was a very long one , thinking him rather tiresome not to let her eat too , and she did not believe that the water-crosses would have excited her brain at all too much , but she consoled herself with the thought that something she would be allowed to eat would come presently : and , besides , he apologised so very politely and in such grand words that she could not but feel flattered at his behaviour .
The next course consisted of a large eel at one end of the table and , at the other , some dace sliced up and mixed with chopped weeds .
These weeds were of a sort which is thought a great dainty , as it will only grow in mud of a particular soil  and the Professor was much pleased to see what a recherché page : 34 dinner was being given him and his pupil .
`` But unfortunately , '' said he `` I must , with the acutest commiseration , refuse to sanction your indulging in the luxuries before us .
These dishes are of a rich and over-nutritious quality and temporarily dull the mind .
I , whose mind nothing can dull , and who have , moreover , partaken freely of water-cresses , may safely , nay advantageously , consume these , for you , too treacherous dainties .
I shall be assisted by their nutritive forces to go through the enormous mental labour I shall presently have to commence on your behalf .
You - it grieves me , it depresses me , to say it - you must forbear . ''
Daffodil felt inclined to tell him the right way would have been for her to eat both of the water-cresses and of the fish , and then one would have made up for the other for her as well as for him : but Keziah had often told her it was rude to argue .
And then , as the eel and the dace and the weeds were all raw , they were not much loss to her .
The Croäxaxicans can not bear even the thought of fire , so of course boiling and roasting and frying are out of the question .
Next came the soup - it being the Croäxaxican fashion to serve the soup in the middle of the meal , in consequence of a King of Croäxaxica a few thousand years ago having once , during a hunting expedition , unexpectedly entered a nobleman 's dining-hall while the family were sitting at dinner , just as the second course was being removed , and asked to be helped to soup .
`` One half-quarter of a half-spoonful of this delicious soup , for a taste , '' said the Professor ladling page : 35 out a few drops into a plate for Daffodil .
`` Not more  alas !
not more .
I fear I am too venturesome in allowing you this  but it goes to my heart to restrict you , and I permit this one excess .
This soup , the most exquisite existing , excepting indeed its one paragon , that flavoured with mud from the roots of the water-parsley and the juice of pounded snails , is endowed with the property of calming the sentiments .
I , indeed , need all there is in this soup-tureen , and even more , to partly allay the passionate devotion I feel for the tedious duty awaiting me  but your sentiment of gratitude to Her Majesty and to me - the sentiment which will inspire you to intelligent attention even when for a moment or two the delight of my lesson may perchance cease to fascinate you , on account of some difficulty to your limited faculties , - that sentiment should have no allaying .
But the comparatively limited quantity I have allowed you can be neutralised by this . ''
And , suddenly , reaching across the table , he popped into her mouth a tiny dried fly , a little smaller than a pin 's head , which he had taken out of his pocket .
Daffodil was grateful for his consideration for her , but yet she had a feeling that she could have done without both fly and drops of soup .
For the soup , which looked like green-pea pottage of rather a deep colour , was ditch-water with a strong flavour of water-parsley  and she thought the taste for it must be an acquired one , as she heard her father and mother say about some stuff called caviare which they had once given her to taste , and , which she had not enjoyed .
The next course was of bright blue craw-fish and page : 36 cockles .
These , the Professor said , were irritating to the nerves , unless counteracted by composing food , like the eel and dace he had recently consumed .
So he had to eat them too without allowing her to share them with him .
The next course was minnows and stickle-backs .
These , the Professor said , were dangerously enlivening , and rendered it difficult to fix the attention .
He nearly cleared both dishes himself  but he explained that his attention was always so fixed that nothing could unfix it .
For dessert there were , besides some pulpy berries of a rare kind which the Croäxaxicans cultivate in green ooze , choice sea-weeds brought from distant beds in a tunnel which had anciently communicated with the seashore .
They are a very notable and expensive luxury , and the servants were directed to say that they were sent by order of the Queen herself .
The Professor was more sympathising than ever when he had to forbid his pupil 's taking any of these .
They were , it appeared the most terrible things in the world for making people sleepy .
But , as his love of study had made him acquire the habit of never going to sleep at all , he did not feel afraid of them , and he ate them all up .
The berries , he told her , had a weakening effect on the memory : but he had come to know all about everything the moment he thought upon it , even if he had never heard of it before , so memory was of no consequence to him , and he ate all the berries too .
Daffodil felt surprised and very thankful to be allowed at last a sip of what she took for water .
But the water , being in fact a Croäxaxican wine , page : 37 was strongly impregnated with an aroma of distilled chickweed , and was not palatable to her .
When they had done dinner , the Professor offered her his arm to the adjacent canal .
But she thanked him politely and , pointing to her wet clothes , explained that she had already had a bath .
The Professor looked at her in great astonishment , for he could not see that was any reason for not taking another , and it is the custom among well-bred Croäxaxicans always to swim gently round and round three or four times after dinner .
However , he did not press her , but quietly glided in .
Daffodil admired the smooth easy manner in which he swam round without ruffling the water .
She was surprised to see that his clothes , which she had expected to be quite spoiled , were fresher when he came out than when he went in .
The dessert things were removed , and master and pupil began their labour .
The Professor of Everything ordered a large bowl of mussels to be brought .
He informed Daffodil that these were to assist her in acquiring the Croäxaxican manner of speech-since , besides their well-known property of clearing the brain , they had the property of clearing the throat , thus making it able to exhale Ghchrrghxxxrr in a loud and dignified harmony .
So he popped a mussel into her mouth to begin with and swallowed two himself , which was not , he pointed out , because his throat needed any clearing , for , if it had a fault , it was always being too clear , but in order to prevent a bad effect on it from the harsh and unnatural sounds of the human pronunciation he must condescend to employ in the preliminary stages of her page : 38 education .
He then proceeded to deliver his celebrated treatise on the origin and use of speech .
Daffodil did not understand much of the treatise , but she listened hard .
And at length it became easy for her to know what the words he was saying were , though they were so much like the seven syllable part of her spelling-book that she could not often understand more than two at a time .
At the end of an hour the Professor took out his watch .
It was the first of its kind Daffodil had seen and she could not help leaning forward to peep at it .
A Croäxaxican watch has no hands : the figures are made of small flower-buds , which open each at the hour it marks , and wither each at its fixed time before the next hour 's flower-buds open .
The watch-case is made of the pink lining of shells : it is filled with a fine golden sand into which the flowers are set after it has been well damped .
The flowers have to be renewed every twelve hours .
The wealthiest Croäxaxicans keep two watches in regular use , so that their servants can always have one ready when the other has run out its hours .
The Professor used two , and a servant came every twelve hours to bring him the fresh one and take the other to put in new flowers .
The Professor looked at his watch , popped one mussel into Daffodil 's mouth and two into his own , took one swim round , and then sat down and resumed his discourse .
He did this regularly at the end of each hour .
Daffodil did not much relish the mussels , but , when she found that her lesson lasted to Thursday morning , she thought it a lucky thing for her that she had them to keep her from getting quite exhausted .
page : 39 Learning Croäxaxican was not so difficult as she had expected .
She had mistaken it for a foreign language , but the Regius Professor of Everything explained that it was only a question of pronunciation and accent .
It is not to be supposed , he told her , that things would be so mismanaged that creatures having the same boundaries of latitude and longitude should have different words for the same meaning .
That would be too irrational .
`` What really is the case , '' said he , `` is that the inferior animals , such as horses , birds , crickets , cows , human beings , and flies , have imitated the great Croäxaxican language in all respects excepting its pronunciation and accent - in which they find a difficulty because of the peculiar constructions of their throats , which are none of them like ours .
It is so long , '' he continued , `` since the Croäxaxicans settled in this kingdom and entirely abandoned their dry and useless territory above water , that all you creatures , debarred from access to us , have had time to forget a good deal of what you had learned before we left you to shift for yourselves . ''
Then he went on to set forth all about pronunciation .
And Daffodil thought it highly interesting , because she saw how , by listening intelligently to the conversation of any species of animals , so as to find out how they pronounced and accentuated , she should be able to understand and use their manner of speech .
But , though it was highly interesting , the poor child got woefully sleepy when she had been hearing all this information for half a day and a whole night .
The Professor good-naturedly put pieces of rush page : 40 across her eyes to keep them open , or she would certainly have dozed off .
And no one can tell what would have happened to her , and to the Professor , if she had not learned Croäxaxican by the appointed time .
When Daffodil perfectly understood the Professor of Everything 's rules about pronunciation and accent , he made her recite his treatise on the origin and use of speech , after him , in the Croäxaxican tongue , over and over again for twelve hours , until , if it had not been for her having got so hoarse that she could not speak at all , she was able to converse with great fluency .
The next thing was to accustom her ears to the sound of the language , so that she might readily understand what was said to her : and , with that object , the Professor decided to talk , himself , till Thursday morning .
Daffodil was to prove her attention by saying the Ohs and Ahs in the right places .
The Professor ate three mussels to prepare himself , and then began the history of his own life , which , he said , would make the lesson more attractive to her than any other subject would do .
It was very kind of him , Daffodil thought , but still she found it hard work to attend so carefully as was necessary , and sometimes she put the Ohs and Ahs in the wrong places .
For the story of the Regius Professor of Everything 's life was very long , and it did not appear that anything had ever happened to him .
She was glad she had the rushes in her eyes , for it would have been shocking if she had been so rude as to fall asleep when the Professor was being so obliging as to relate his own history , and yet she verily believed page : 41 she should have been in risk of doing so but for those useful rushes .
When the Professor left off speaking it was Thursday morning and the Queen 's commands were obeyed .
Daffodil could talk reasonably : that is to say she could talk Croäxaxican .
page : 42 CHAPTER IV .
THE Professor of Everything went at once to inform Her Majesty of the execution of her order .
`` I have the honour , the satisfaction , and the pride , of announcing to Your Majesty that the human being can speak , '' he said , with great elation .
But Her Majesty only replied `` Of course it can : I ordered that it should . ''
And she did not offer him breakfast , as he had counted upon her doing .
So he returned to his home in discontent , and spent the rest of the day in eating mussels and communing with philosophy .
His servants used to say that communing with philosophy looked to them just like going to sleep .
But the Regius Professor of Everything , as I have said before , never went to sleep .
Daffodil , as soon as she was alone , began a comfortable yawn .
But she had the disappointment of being interrupted in it .
The Officer in Command entered , followed by four other officers of high rank .
He advanced towards her , and informed her courteously that he had come to conduct her to the Royal Palace .
He could give her exactly two minutes and a quarter to prepare in .
And he asked her to do him the honour to inform him if she was a gentle - page : 43 man or a lady , so that he might know whether to send a valet or a lady 's - maid to assist her .
`` You are very kind , '' said Daffodil .
`` But I am only a little girl  and I can manage quite nicely by myself . ''
For she thought a frog lady 's - maid would not be much help to her .
Washing made her feel fresher  but she was still so sleepy that she could not venture to take the rushes out of her eyes , and she felt afraid that , if they did not give her water-cresses to excite her brain , she would soon be altogether stupefied .
She was trying to smooth her hair when , precisely at the two minutes and a quarter , the officers came back , followed by a guard of forty soldiers .
They looked surprised at her occupation , and the Officer in Command begged that she would not pull out those yellow rushes before she had been presented to Her Majesty , who would expect to see her in the same condition as when she was consigned to his keeping .
`` I have no doubt , '' he said encouragingly , `` that Her Majesty will graciously permit you to get rid of the encumbrance , after she has inspected it . ''
`` Pull out my hair ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil , aghast .
`` Why I should not think of such a thing . ''
But there was no time for explanations , and she was marched off .
She was conducted through several corridors and galleries , crossed here and there by trenches full of water through which she had to wade , as she could not swim like the soldiers .
At last she arrived at the anteroom where she was to wait till Their Majesties should be pleased to order her to be brought before them .
The rushes in her eyes kept her from falling page : 44 downright asleep , but she was all the while growing more and more bewildered , till at last it seemed to her as if all this were a dream and she found herself every now and then saying nonsensical things , as if she were talking in her sleep .
Just as she had taken the Officer in Command for Keziah and was saying to him `` Oh dear , you have made a mistake and put me to bed in the washing-tub , '' the order came for him to bring in the prisoner .
The guard formed round her again , the officers marched together ahead , and she was led from the waiting-room into a long arched gallery which opened right into the Great Throne Hall .
The canal of the Great Throne Hall was too deep for her to wade , but she was now too stupefied to feel frightened .
It was more and more like a dream , and she made no resistance when two soldiers drew her in with them .
It was lucky for her that , as a matter of form , they supported her , for else she would have gone under .
The soldiers continued to support her on each side - for that was the proper way of bringing a prisoner into the Royal Presence - and next she found herself standing in front of the Throne .
She saw , in a hazy kind of way , that all the seats on the steps were filled by frogs , and that there were two frogs in bright robes and with shining crowns on their heads sitting on the two topmost seats .
She had just sense enough left to understand that she was before Their Majesties , and to make her court curtsey to them .
The King thought her so strange-looking a creature that he burst out laughing  and , as that was an unusual exertion for him , it sent him to sleep page : 45 at once .
But the Queen , although this was a State occasion and all the Court were assembled , condescended to speak to her with her own Royal lips .
`` What are you , and on what mission have you come to our Kingdom ? ''
she said .
But Daffodil was half dreaming and she somehow got a dazed notion that the Queen was Keziah dressed up  so she said to her `` Oh what a dear funny stupid old thing you look ! ''
And she said it in good Croäxaxican , for , after her long lesson , that came the most naturally to her .
You may imagine what consternation there was !
Some of the Maids of Honour shrieked , and the Noblemen drew their swords to defend their Queen .
The Princess Royal almost fainted with horror and alarm .
The Queen was so indignant that she shook the King till he woke up shaken out of breath .
But she was always courageous , and Daffodil looked quite quiet and harmless , and the Officer in Command , directly his prisoner gave that terrible answer , had taken precautions by ordering the whole of the guard to advance and make ready for attack .
So , with a stately and fearless air , Her Majesty said `` Miserable creature , if your life had not been already forfeited by your High Treason against our ceiling , it would become forfeit now .
What room can there be for mercy when - - '' But here Daffodil , who had now got it into her head that Her Majesty was the big black dog barking , interrupted her with `` Do be quiet , there 's a good fellow .
Do n't make a noise . ''
`` I order you to instant death , '' cried the Queen , hopping with rage .
page : 46 `` Lie down and hold your tongue , there 's a good fellow '' said Daffodil .
`` Do you hear ?
Instant death .
Being swallowed by the State Boa Constrictor is the punishment for treason , and he is sure to be very hungry by now , '' cried the Queen , with added fury .
`` You are to die at once . ''
Daffodil looked at her reprovingly , and , holding up a forefinger , said solemnly `` If you go on barking and growling and making such a horrid noise , I shall have to punish you .
Lie down directly . ''
And she clapped her hands and stamped her foot , for that was how she could always make her dog lie down and be quiet .
There was a panic !
The soldiers , thinking that she was going to attack their Queen , all ran away , and the Officer in Command and the four other officers ran as fast as they could after them , shouting `` Quick : guards , quick !
Help us to summon the regiment ! ''
All the Maids of Honour went into hysterics .
The Noblemen hid behind the Maids of Honour and held their breaths .
The Princesses , who were usually quarrelling , threw themselves into each other 's arms and said `` Let us all make it up and die together . ''
The Crown Prince crept under his father 's throne , and the Queen crept under her own .
The second Prince turned as pale as pale could be , but he folded his arms and leaned back in his seat , quoting some poetry of his own about meeting death in the arms of danger , strong and sprightly , brisk and brightly , with an unchanged noble hue , while all the world for fear a startled yellow grew : only he trembled so that he could not say it very distinctly .
page : 47 The King was the only person who did not seem discomposed .
The shrieks of the Maids of Honour disturbed him from a nap , and he looked round saying `` What 's this all about ? ''
but , when he perceived what a turmoil there was , he stretched himself and leaned back in his chair again .
`` This is too much for me , '' he said .
And then he made this speech : `` Noble Croäxaxicans , Lords and Ladies , my loyal and deserving subjects , things seem going wrong , but Her Majesty , my wife , who is absent somewhere or other now on business of the State , knows my mind on the subject and will put them all right presently when she comes back . ''
And with these words he went to sleep .
Daffodil , meanwhile , having no longer the two soldiers to keep her up , as they had run off among their comrades , had dropped down on the ground , with her head resting on the lowest step of the throne .
She thought she was in bed , and she was trying hard to go to sleep , but the rushes in her eyes prevented her and she was too drowsy to take them out .
When the tumult had subsided and nothing was heard of Daffodil , the Queen took courage to peep out from under her throne , and , to her great surprise , saw the cause of all the alarm lying motionless .
At first she thought it was a trick to entice her within reach , but , when nearly half an hour had passed and Daffodil still did not stir , she felt reassured , and , coming out from under her throne , took her seat on it with great dignity .
`` The creature had some sense of duty , after all , '' she said .
`` I ordered it to die at once , and it has page : 48 done so .
Probably it did not understand that my order implied an intention of having it put to death by the proper person .
I shall now have it rewarded for its obedience by a magnificent State Funeral .
Somebody pick up the body . ''
But they were all afraid to go near it , and at last the Queen herself came down the steps and , very cautiously , stood beside the half torpid child .
`` It seems to breathe , '' she said .
`` And yet it is certainly dead .
Look at the way it lies : could any live thing lie so ?
Some of you lie down and try the experiment . ''
All the Maids of Honour and half the courtiers lay down and tried to arrange their limbs like Daffodil 's .
But none of them could do it .
`` Yes , it is quite dead , '' said the Queen .
`` No doubt it is the nature of such creatures to breathe after they are dead . ''
Then she put out her hand and touched Daffodil 's cheek .
The scream with which she started back terrified the Court .
`` It is hot !
Burning hot ! ''
cried Her Majesty .
`` Oh !
oh !
How it has hurt me !
Get me a doctor , this moment . ''
`` Good gracious !
Is it alive ? ''
shrieked all the Maids of Honour .
`` Do n't expose your ignorance , '' replied Her Majesty sharply .
`` Do you think anything could be in that fiery state and live ?
No doubt these creatures smoulder away after death .
In fact we had better have some buckets of water thrown over it at once to prevent it getting on fire . ''
Daffodil heard all this and felt too heavy to say anything .
It seemed to her that she was continuing page : 49 her dream .
If she had spoken , it would have been to say that she did not feel hot at all , but very chilly .
People of different countries have different views on some things : the cheek which seemed to the Croäxaxican Queen to be at burning heat would have been called as cold as a frog by any of us .
However , the Croäxaxicans thought she would be in smoke and ashes presently , and so , at the moment on which the Head Royal Physician came hurrying in at one entrance , forty attendants with buckets of water pushed each other in through another entrance .
The Head Royal Physician gasped out eagerly `` How is Her Majesty ?
Is she still alive ? ''
But Her Majesty , who had forgotten the pain of her hand , said severely `` What do you mean by intruding upon Us in this unseemly manner and getting in the way of the buckets ? ''
Then she ordered the attendants to make haste and throw the water upon the creature , one after the other as fast as they could .
Daffodil was disturbed by this shower-bath .
She was so wet already that nothing could make her wetter , but she felt the shock unpleasantly .
She lifted her head and , looking slowly round , said `` Oh dear : How it is raining !
Give me an umbrella . ''
You may fancy the general terror when they heard this from the creature they had all believed to be dead .
But , the shower-bath being over , Daffodil put her head on the step again and went on trying to go to sleep .
`` It does not seem a dangerous creature , after all '' said the Queen .
`` It sleeps , a shape of doubt and mysterie .
Not frog nor fish : whatever can it be ? ''
page : 50 said the second Prince , Prince Brekekex , who had to talk in verse because he was a poet .
`` A human being , '' replied the Queen .
`` I explained all about it .
I suppose you were making a poem about it , instead of attending . ''
`` Yes , '' said Prince Brekekex , `` Blame me not , I thought a poet 's thought  In that , great Queen , you have guessed very well : And now , on this strange creature hither brought , I gaze in awe , and ask `` Is it unwell ? ''
`` How clever you are , my dear boy ! ''
said the Queen , in delight .
`` It 's just what I have been thinking all along without knowing I was . ''
And the courtiers and the Maids of Honour all said it was just what they had been thinking without knowing they were , and that it showed what a great poet Prince Brekekex was that he should say in verse the very thing they should have said themselves in prose , if they had thought of it in time .
`` Cure the creature at once , '' said the Queen to the Head Royal Physician .
The Head Royal Physician did not much like it , but he was obliged to go close to Daffodil and he had to feel her pulse , which made him start and cry out worse than the Queen had done .
Then he told the Queen that the creature was in a feverish and excitable state and required sleep , and that it must at once take a composing draught to put it to sleep if possible .
There was no time to lose , he said .
So messengers were sent in hot haste to bring what was wanted  and , when they had returned the Head Royal Physician set to work to compound the draught himself , so that it might be sure to be page : 51 rightly mixed .
Some of the attendants were ordered to carry the patient to a couch , and the Queen herself again descended from her throne and stood near her to see the result of the draught being given .
Nobody would undertake to administer it , so the poor Head Royal Physician , trembling all over , had to do it himself .
Luckily for him , Daffodil opened her mouth in a great yawn : he seized the moment and in went the draught .
Daffodil spluttered and coughed - it was only a mussel-shell full , but it went the wrong way and half choked her .
She was still too sleepy to understand what was going on , but she sat up and rubbed her eyes .
The rushes that held her eyelids open gave way at that , and , the moment they were out , she dropped back on her couch in a dead sleep .
There was a shout of admiration from the whole Court .
Never was such a Head Royal Physician !
The Queen knighted him on the spot .
Prince Brekekex promised to write a poem about him .
The King said `` I shall never fear now not getting my proper quantity of sleep : I shall only have to send for my Head Royal Physician , if I should ever be in a difficulty about it . ''
It was years since His Majesty had made so long a speech to a subject .
The Crown Prince , who , feeling the solemnity of his greatness , did not converse , broke his habit so far as to say distinctly `` Hear , Hear ! ''
when the King had left off .
The Head Royal Physician swelled with joy .
He looked nearly twice the size he had been when he gave the draught .
But he thought best to hide his feelings .
`` I do not deserve so much praise , '' he said meekly .
`` If there were any one in the king - page : 52 dom who knew so much medical science as I do , I daresay he would have been able to do it nearly as well . ''
`` True worth is always modest , we are told By them of new and them of old , '' said Prince Brekekex .
And the Head Royal Physician only wished that the Regius Professor of Everything had been there to witness the honour he was receiving and to hear what Prince Brekekex had said .
`` It would lessen his conceit somewhat , '' he thought .
For the Head Royal Physician and the Regius Professor of Everything , while each sincerely revering the other as the second greatest sage the world could boast , and even each avowing that the other excelled him in some special branches of science of a technical nature or of limited importance , were each a little afraid that the other thought too much of himself .
The Queen began to think so well of Daffodil that she was half inclined to have her removed on her couch to a private room of the palace : but , on the Head Royal Physician 's saying that he could not answer for the consequences if any accident were to startle the patient awake before it had slept off its inclination to frenzy , Her Majesty ordered that the creature should be left to sleep out its sleep where it was .
Thereupon , as the business was over , she broke up the Court .
A herald in orange proclaimed through a crimson flower-trumpet that Their Majesties were about to depart .
The Lord Chamberlain respectfully and vigorously shook up the King , who , leaning on the Lord Chamberlain 's arm , descended , with a deliberate and lofty bearing for page : 53 which he was celebrated , from the throne where he had been left sitting alone while the Queen and all the Court had gathered around Daffodil 's couch .
Then a procession formed , the Royal Band struck up the Royal March of the Croäxaxicans , and Their Majesties , the Princes , the Princesses , the Maids of Honour , the courtiers , the officers , the guards and the attendants went off in order .
Daffodil was left with her forty soldiers to keep watch over her .
The Head Royal Physician marched away in his due place in the procession , holding his head so high that it could hardly be seen at all in front , but he came back squeezed small , for the Queen had reprimanded him sharply for leaving his patient .
He placed himself in a big arm-chair at the head of the couch , and there he had to sit till Daffodil should wake of her own accord , for Their Majesties had it proclaimed that whoever should , by any means , intentional or accidental , and for any motive , good or bad , hasten the awakening of the human being , should be imprisoned for life with hard labour and only one newspaper a week .
page : 54 CHAPTER V. DAFFODIL slept exactly a week .
When she woke , she was at first much puzzled at finding herself inside what seemed a great green globe and lying on a couch of wet moss , with an array of strange creatures round her .
`` Dear me , what an odd dream ! ''
she said , rubbing her eyes .
But , the more awake she grew , the plainer she saw the frogs and the green hall she was in .
`` It actually must be real , and not a dream , '' said she .
`` Pray , Mr. Frog , are you real ? ''
But the Head Royal Physician , to whom she spoke , made no reply , for he did not understand her .
He offered her a plate of mussels , for which he had sent one of the soldiers as soon as he saw her begin to open her eyes .
The sight of the mussels aroused her memory at once .
`` No , thank you , '' said she , in good Croäxaxican .
`` No mussels : I feel quite as clever as I want to be this morning .
But , if you could give me some tea and toast for breakfast .
I am so hungry . ''
Nobody there had ever heard of tea and toast .
But , after some consultation , a soldier was sent with page : 55 a message to the Head Royal Cook , and presently returned with water-cresses and minnows , which he offered to her .
She thought this a strange sort of breakfast  however , she saw she had no chance of anything more like what she had at home and she made a good meal of water-cresses and the plateful of mussels , which the Head Royal Physician forced her to eat and which , in her hunger , she found she enjoyed .
The minnows she declined , as politely as she could : `` They are very fine and very fresh , I am sure , '' she said .
`` But I am not used to them quite so under-done . ''
For she thought it would be rude to call them raw .
She felt revived by her breakfast , and was now quite able to accompany the Head Royal Physician to her former quarters in the Royal State Prison .
The soldiers , of course , formed an escort as before .
As the Head Royal Physician was kind in manner , she took courage to ask him if she might be allowed to wash and dress .
`` And if somebody would be so kind as to lend me some clothes while these are washed ! ''
she added imploringly .
`` While these are buried , you mean , '' said the Head Royal Physician .
`` They will wash , '' she replied .
`` What can you mean ? ''
said the Head Royal Physician .
`` Wash clothes !
And such soiled clothes as these !
The servants will bury them in the proper bog for that purpose . ''
`` But I have no others , '' pleaded Daffodil .
`` Whether you have others or no , these will be buried , '' said the Head Royal Physician , with a wave of his hand to settle the question .
`` We inimitable page : 56 Croäxaxicans are more particular about cleanliness than the foreign and less advanced races of the world , and for us to allow clothes nearly a fortnight old to go about on any one !
Faugh !
Unheard of !
Besides , as your medical adviser , I could not allow it .
But never mind , '' he added good-naturedly , seeing that she was distressed .
`` If you want clothes , I will tell the Queen , to whom I must now report my complete cure of you , and no doubt Her Majesty will allow you some .
If she does not , you could find some on the first highway : plenty of them in Croäxaxica .
Now then , in for your bath , and off I go . ''
He had pushed her into the canal as he spoke , and he was out of the room before she had recovered breath .
The bath proved very refreshing , but her clothes became but little the cleaner for it .
She was still trying to rub out the stains the river mud had made on her frock , when the Lieutenant of the State Prison entered the room , followed by a company of soldiers .
He greeted her with much courtesy , and even hopped round to her - only once indeed , but he would not have done more even to a frog , unless of the highest rank .
On her part , as she had learnt the rules of behaviour from the Regius Professor of Everything , she hopped twice round to him , and did it twice over to show deference to so high a functionary of the state .
`` Creature . ''
said the Lieutenant of the State Prison , who did not know what else to call her , `` you are to leave the prison forthwith : whether to return or not I am unable to say .
You will be under the escort of this troop of armed and determined grenadiers .
page : 57 I warn you to make no attempt at escape : it would be punished as High Treason . ''
`` And I should not know where to escape to '' said Daffodil .
`` Precisely so , '' said the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` It is vain for the boldest to think to escape from the inimitable Croäxaxicans : though human , you have intelligence .
Go then , creature , and be obedient .
I wish you good fortune . ''
Thereupon the soldiers surrounded her , and she was blindfolded and marched off .
After about ten minutes ' progress , sometimes on moss and sometimes on mud and weeds and sometimes through canals , the soldiers halted .
The prisoner 's eyes were unbound , and she found herself under an archway , - or , rather , in a tunnel .
It was everywhere lined with short close-grown grass , and was lighted , not very brightly , by a runlet on each side .
The frog in command of the guard was a little way ahead in conversation with two frogs in the Royal Livery who seemed to be watchmen , and who stood on the right and left of what looked like a dark cave .
Presently she was marched into this cave and left alone with the watchmen , who were loudly uttering a `` Ghchhxhxxsrrrrrrrrrrr '' which seemed to be a call .
Then they were still , and she heard , the measured flopping of the departing soldiers as they got more and more distant .
She was in the dark and could only listen  it was of no use trying to see .
Next she heard a faint sound of water , and then a louder , and , all at once , a stream , rushing into its channel beside her , filled the place with light .
Then she saw it was not a cave , but a very long page : 58 low corridor .
At the far end stood a figure in bright clothes - pink and blue with a white apron .
This was a maid-servant whom the watchmen had summoned by their call , and who , after turning on the lighting water , was waiting for Daffodil .
`` Is this the new arrival we 're to find clothes for ? ''
said the maid-servant , when the watchmen came up to her with Daffodil .
`` Well it is an object ! ''
`` It has to be made as pretty as you , Miss , '' said one of the watchmen : and the maid-servant tittered , and both the watchmen grinned at the joke .
`` I do n't like the charge of it , '' said the servant , eyeing Daffodil askance , when she had recovered her gravity .
`` It ca n't escape , '' one of the watchmen replied .
`` We are to stay here  and the guard is at the outer courtyard entrance , if it could get past us . ''
`` I daresay , '' said the servant : `` but how about my escaping , if it turns on me ? ''
And she looked uneasily at Daffodil 's teeth and nails .
`` Do n't be afraid , '' said Daffodil .
`` I will not give you any trouble . ''
The servant was so startled at being addressed in good Croäxaxican by the strange being she had thought a sort of deaf and dumb savage that she gave a loud scream .
`` Do n't be frightened , Miss , '' said one of the watchmen .
`` They tell me it 's only a foreign sort of frog .
And you see how naturally it 's learned to talk already . ''
`` I am a Human Being , '' said Daffodil , drawing herself up .
`` Ah !
poor thing !
That 's it - a human being '' page : 59 said the good-natured watchman .
`` It ca n't help it : it 's nature .
And the Regius Professor of Everything will soon make it just like one of us . ''
`` Well , come along then , human being , '' said the servant .
`` And mind you do n't go anywhere without my leave . ''
The corridor through which Daffodil had come opened only into another corridor crossing it at right angles .
Along this second corridor she now followed the servant , almost in the dark , for some minutes .
Then there was a wide canal to cross , and a low entrance to grope through , and she was in what seemed to be a large nursery garden - a nursery garden not only floored , but walled and roofed , with lines of large oblong flower-beds cut out in the moss , filled each with one kind of flower .
This was the Queen 's Royal Wardrobe room , and the oblong flower-beds were in fact wardrobe-shelves , arranged , like the Croäxaxican bookshelves , with strips of moss between them .
The clothes in Croäxaxican wardrobes are placed on the floor or on the walls or on the ceiling , according to whether their manner of growth is upright , climbing , or drooping .
The ceiling is always pitched very low , so that the clothes growing there may be within reach .
`` What enormous flowers ! ''
said Daffodil .
`` How do you get them to grow to such a size ? ''
`` What a silly question ! ''
said the maid .
`` What use would they be to us if they were too small ? ''
Daffodil observed that the rows between which they were passing were of the same sort of flowers as the servant 's skirt .
`` Is this where you got your pretty frock ? ''
she inquired .
page : 60 `` It 's where the Royal Dresspickers picked it this morning , '' said the servant .
`` All these shelves we 're among now are for the clothes of the Royal Wardrobe-maids to grow in : where we 've come is for the Royal Cook-maids : and those shelves there to the right , that you can see if you peep between the stalks of these jackets , are for the Royal Housemaids : and these common things we are just coming to are for the Royal Scullery-maids .
But where yours are to come from , I ca n't imagine .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary wo n't surely match you with Royal Scullery-maids . ''
They were just entering the shelves for the scullery-maids .
`` I should not mind , '' replied Daffodil  `` I think these are prettier than the other clothes . ''
`` What !
these common blue and lilac things !
Well !
You are a judge !
And just feel how thin they are compared to what we superior classes wear . ''
`` Are they very common ? ''
asked Daffodil .
`` I never saw any like them .
They look as if they were big hare-bells made out of the clouds at the end of sunset . ''
`` They 're not to say common , '' was the answer .
`` We of the Royalty do n't any of us wear common things , and there are not many of this sort outside the Royal Wardrobe : but the Royal Scullery-maids do n't count high compared with the other orders of Royal Servants , and of course their clothes count according . ''
`` And you think these are what I shall have to wear ? ''
said Daffodil .
`` You ! ''
the servant exclaimed in a tone which did not sound complimentary .
`` That I do n't .
I page : 61 do n't suppose it would be thought of to put upon the Royal Scullery-maids that way .
Did n't I tell you so just now ? ''
`` We will not talk about it any more , '' said Daffodil gravely .
She meant her manner to be a reproof  for certainly the frog was not polite .
But the frog servant-maid , instead of feeling corrected , burst out laughing .
It was the first laugh Daffodil had heard in Croäxaxican , and it startled her so that she turned first white and then red .
For a moment she thought the frog was cracking to pieces and this was the noise of the explosion .
`` My ! ''
said the servant when she could speak .
`` The Regius Professor of Everything has taught you to be somebody !
I suppose you think yourself quite a frog ! ''
Daffodil replied only by a dignified silence , at which her companion laughed still louder than before .
They went on through rows of flowers which seemed to Daffodil interminable .
At last she said `` Is there much more of this garden ? ''
`` Garden ! ''
was the astonished reply .
`` You ca n't see the garden from here . ''
`` I mean the garden we are in '' said Daffodil .
`` I never !
Has n't the Regius Professor of Everything taught you what 's a garden and what 's a wardrobe ?
This is a wardrobe .
Wardrobe - wardrobe  you see - for clothes . ''
And she repeated several times , very loud , `` Wardrobe , '' `` Clothes , '' pointing all round , so that Daffodil might understand .
`` What is the difference , then , between a wardrobe and a garden ? ''
inquired Daffodil .
page : 62 The frog went off into another fit of laughter .
`` Well , you are fun ! ''
she said , when it was over .
`` Difference between a wardrobe and a garden !
Why , one 's a garden and the other 's a wardrobe .
Ca n't you understand ? ''
`` Not yet , '' said Daffodil .
`` Dear !
dear !
what a deal of explaining you take !
There 's no difference between them - at least it 's all difference : one 's one and the other 's the other . ''
`` Yes , '' said Daffodil `` that is how it is where I come from , too .
But what is a garden ? ''
`` What should it be but a garden ?
A place where people go to do nothing and look at the patterns . ''
`` Are the flowers in your gardens as big as these ? ''
`` Flowers !
You do n't suppose gardeners allow flowers in a garden ? ''
`` Do they have only leaves , then ? ''
`` Leaves ?
Flowers and leaves in a garden !
That would be fine untidiness .
What do you suppose gardeners are for , if they do n't scrape away everything that tries to grow ? ''
`` Your gardens must be different from ours , '' was all Daffodil could say .
`` I should think that very likely , '' said the frog pointedly .
Then , seeing that Daffodil showed no enjoyment of her joke , she checked as well as she could the laughter it had excited in herself , and said `` Come do n't be downcast : I wo n't laugh at you any more  and of course it ca n't be expected that human beings should have gardens , or anything page : 63 else , as good as ours .
It 's no blame to you  why , there 's nothing in the world to match us .
Do n't you know we 're called the inimitable Croäxaxicans ? ''
`` Who call you so ? ''
Daffodil asked , a little tartly .
`` We should n't be called so if it were n't true and known to everybody , '' was the answer .
`` But , come , I do n't believe you 've ever seen a real garden : would you like a peep at the Queen 's Royal Private one ? ''
`` That I should , '' said Daffodil , whose curiosity was excited .
The wardrobe-maid , turning into a shelf on the right hand , led the way in and out among rows of clothes till they came to some canals and corridors much like those by which they had entered .
These led them to a corridor so low that Daffodil had to stoop , to avoid touching the top with her head .
It was quite dark .
`` I ca n't see here , '' said Daffodil , hesitating about going on .
`` How should you ?
Do they see in the dark in your country ? ''
`` But we put lights in our dark passages . ''
`` Then how do you manage to keep them dark ? ''
`` They are not dark passages when the lights are lit : that is true , '' said Daffodil , thinking she saw the point .
`` I do n't mean whether you call them light or call them dark : but , if you put light into the passages to the garden , where do you get the darkness to pass out of ? ''
`` I do n't think I quite understand you , '' said Daffodil .
page : 64 `` I never thought you did , '' said the frog , with a giggle .
`` Look here , I 'll explain .
Darkness is darkness and light is light : you know that much ? ''
`` Yes . ''
`` And , when people want darkness , they do n't go and light a place full of light : now , do they ? ''
`` No , '' said Daffodil .
`` Nobody would do that . ''
`` Well then , now you know that , you understand why nobody would think of lighting the entrance to a garden . ''
`` I do n't quite , '' said Daffodil , as she continued to grope along the passage , keeping close behind her guide .
But , all at once , the corridor turned a corner : the light burst on her eyes as she stood in front of what seemed a blaze of colours .
Then she understood that the Croäxaxicans pass to their gardens through a dark passage in order that they may come suddenly on the broad open space with its flashing canals , and thus see the many-hued patterns in a brilliancy beyond the reality , from the contrast with the dusk out of which they have come upon them .
The garden seemed to Daffodil an immense hall walled , paved , and ceiled , with patterns of every shape and colour in mosaic of some rough material .
On the floor the patterns were bordered and traced out by runlets and canals , some but an inch wide , some a yard or two , and by geometrically shaped pools .
A large waterfall plunged from the roof into a round lake in the centre of the central pattern , and , along the walls , at regular intervals , were smaller waterfalls descending into pools framed in variegated page : 65 curves and zigzags .
Here and there , beside the more important patterns , and in the spray of the waterfalls , were placed rustic seats constructed of shells and fish-bone lattice .
`` Oh !
what lovely water ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil .
`` It looks like green fire . ''
`` It 's the best  and there 's plenty of it , '' replied the frog-servant .
`` But there 's nothing so particular about that : anybody has that in their garden .
But did you ever see such lots of patterns and such lots of colours ?
They take money to get them .
And look at the blue earth : the dye 's a secret , and you wo n't see that in anybody 's garden but ours .
It 's only Royalty may use it . ''
`` Is that blue stuff earth ? ''
asked Daffodil , surprised , as she looked at the blue vandykes to which her attention had been called .
`` Of course it 's earth .
It 's all earth here but the water and the seats .
Do n't the gardeners in your country use earth for the garden beds ? ''
`` Yes , but they do n't dye it .
They put flowers into it for the patterns . ''
`` The juices of flowers , you mean - to colour it .
That 's how our gardeners do , too . ''
`` No , they do n't colour the earth  they leave it brown and they plant - '' `` Never mind  they 'll learn some day , '' interrupted the frog , who did not care to listen to Daffodil 's explanation of so uncivilised a system of gardening .
`` But let me hear what you think of the garden .
Did you ever see such lovely bright colours ? ''
`` They are not so bright as some of the flowers in the wardrobe , '' said Daffodil .
page : 66 `` That 's nothing .
The flowers grow that way : this is all artificial . ''
At that moment there advanced into the garden , from an entrance just opposite to where Daffodil and her guide were standing , two frogs smaller than any Croäxaxicans Daffodil had yet seen , followed by two full-grown frogs holding huge round green leaves over the little ones ' heads , for parasols .
Other frogs , apparently nurse-maids and pages , were coming on behind these , but Daffodil had no time to observe the procession , for the Royal Wardrobe-maid , exclaiming `` Good gracious !
the Royal Nursemaids ! ''
dragged her into the passage and scrambled back with her to the Royal Wardrobe as fast as they could get along .
`` What is the matter ? ''
asked Daffodil , when they stopped to take breath , safe among the shelves again .
`` Those were the youngest Royal Princesses , '' replied the servant .
`` But why had we to run away from them ? ''
`` It is n't so much them  it 's the Royal Nursemaids , nasty jealous tell-tales !
But they had n't time to get their eyes undazzled before we were out of sight . ''
`` Were we trespassing , then ? ''
`` Do n't pretend you did n't know '' said the frog , snappishly .
`` You 'll only give me a very low opinion of you .
You ca n't make me believe you 've had the Queen 's leave to go into her Royal Private Garden whenever you choose . ''
`` I must ask you , '' said Daffodil , `` to be so kind as not again to take me anywhere where I am a trespasser .
I am not used to go into people 's premises in an underhand way . ''
page : 67 `` Then it 's to be supposed you do n't call breaking in through their Royal Throne Hall ceiling , and calling all their army out to keep you quiet , going into people 's premises in an underhand way , '' retorted the frog .
`` That was an accident . ''
`` Well , all I know is you 're a trespasser wherever you go in Croäxaxica : so perhaps you 'll be good enough to tell me where I am to take you . ''
And the frog sat down , as if to wait for Daffodil 's instructions .
`` This is not right of you , '' said Daffodil .
`` You must take me where you have been told . ''
The frog , being vexed at her own imprudence at going into the garden against orders and uneasy lest harm should come of it , naturally was glad to be put into a pet .
So she jumped up and began to scold satisfactorily .
`` Not right , indeed ! ''
exclaimed she .
`` Who are you to talk to me ?
And what is it to you where I was told to take you . ''
`` Not anything , '' Daffodil replied quietly .
`` But I think we ought to go on . ''
The frog drew herself up to her full height .
`` Do you know who you are speaking to ? ''
`` Not quite clearly , '' Daffodil made answer .
`` I should like to know , if you do not mind telling me . ''
`` I do n't mind telling you , now you ask respectfully , '' said the frog , mollified by the politeness of the inquiry .
`` I am a Royal Under Wardrobe-maid . ''
`` And you have charge of these beautiful flowers ? ''
said Daffodil .
`` Well , not exactly charge .
You see there are the Upper Royal Wardrobe-maids , and the Royal Lady 's - page : 68 maids , and the Royal Dresspickers , and the Royal Dressmakers .
But it 's all the same : we 're all in the Plenipotentiary Department , and that 's the highest there is . ''
`` Shall you ever get higher than Under Wardrobe-maid ? ''
asked Daffodil sympathisingly .
But the question jarred on the Under Royal Wardrobe-maid 's sensitiveness : it seemed as if Daffodil thought lightly of her present rank .
`` Higher ! ''
she cried with a toss of her head , `` I think I 'm too high as it is to be gossiping with a human being .
Do come on .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary will be tired of waiting for us , '' and , taking Daffodil 's hand , she rushed off , hopping and bounding , at such a rate that Daffodil , although a swift runner , was dragged on at a speed far beyond all former experience of her own powers , and which she felt she could not keep up for long .
Dashing and splashing on through shelves of flowers that seemed to whirl away as she passed , she ran , as if for her life , until her guide stopped and let go her hand and , after almost losing her balance by the jerk , she found herself in the presence of the highest personage in the country after the Royal Family , the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
page : 69 CHAPTER VI .
AT the upper end of the large oval chamber , a mile in length , which was the Royal Wardrobe , a thin slow waterfall , as transparent as glass , parted off the narrowed tip of the oval , making it a comfortable saloon , of considerable dimensions indeed , as a room , but , from its comparative smallness , offering to the vastness of the wardrobe hall a contrast of retirement and privacy .
Here , seated in orderly rows , grouped according to their grades and occupations , or standing by long narrow work-tables arranged with like preciseness , the numerous staff of what was familiarly known as the Plenipotentiary Department were collected at their tasks of sorting , cutting , and putting together , garments for use during that day and night .
Seated amid them , on a dais under a canopy of marsh marigolds with broad green leaves , the great disposer of Croäxaxican comfort and grace was leaning back , her paws folded on her lap , in an attitude of internal contemplation .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica was a person of such remarkable gifts that , until the dawning fame of Prince Brekekex startled the delighted nation , she page : 70 was recognised as the first and far peerless genius in the world .
This did not interfere with the just renown of the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician , nor did it disturb their satisfaction with themselves and her : they were not geniuses and did not desire to be considered anything of the sort  for genius , they felt , is a matter of chance , and their wisdom was the result of perfected study .
Nor did the growing feeling in Croäxaxica that the poet Prince was perhaps the first genius in the world put the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary really in the position of only second  for she could not make poems and he could not make dresses , so that there was no rivalry between them in their gifts and she remained undisputably paramount in hers .
But , in spite of this dazzling celebrity , and in spite of her exalted position and authority , her manner was characterised by a modesty which , from its contrast , kept all in mind of her greatness , and her apparel by a simplicity which marked her out as the one person in Croäxaxica not in bondage to the Plenipotentiary Department .
To the frequent compliments she received on this modesty and simplicity , she would reply , with a gentle smile , `` Why praise me for what my nature can not help ?
Perhaps I have a little genius - at least the foolish world seems to fancy so - and humility is always the mark of true genius .
I ca n't help being humble , so I have nothing to boast of for being so . ''
She would also explain that the plainness and ease of her dress must not be ascribed to her humility alone , but to the high necessities of art .
`` Inspiration must be page : 71 free from the trammels of self , '' she would say : `` how could I plan costumes if I had to contemplate their physical inconveniences as about to affect myself ?
and how could I concentrate my thoughts if I had , like those who profit by the exercise of my constraining art , to keep my attention fixed on accommodating my movements to the requirements of my clothes and my body to their outline ? ''
She habitually wore a tunic of some light bell-flower , left to hang round her tall and stately figure in its natural shape , sleeveless , the armholes being merely edged by a daisy frill , and unaccompanied by the fashionable leg-flounces of one flower , or row of flower petals , beneath another , beginning so narrow that the top flounce had to be arranged for by the leg being compressed to the size by a bandage of untearable sedge and so wide in the lowest flounces that the wearer could not place her feet less than a yard apart for fear of crushing the flowers - a garment her own latest invention and without which no noble lady but herself would have had the courage to show herself .
But her crimson boots were surmounted by anklets of pearls gleaming out upon the yellow of her beautifully marked skin , and she wore on her forehead a jewel in some lights like a ruby and in some like a topaz , of priceless value , and on her wrists bracelets made of buds of the rarest toadstools .
To-day her tunic was a pale pink heather-bell with a crimson edge , and Daffodil , as she stood before her , waiting for her attention , gazed with admiration on the smooth texture and delicate tint of the gigantic flower .
`` Pre-eminent Madam , '' said the Head Secretary page : 72 Spinster of the Plenipotentiary Department , `` Number Seventy Seven And A Half , Under Royal Wardrobe-maid has at length returned . ''
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary roused herself from her reverie .
`` Seventy Seven And A Half , '' she said in reproving accents , `` you have been a long while .
The Queen has sent to know the reason we have not finished , and we have not even been able to begin . ''
`` I did my best  I did my very best , Pre-eminent Madam .
I 'm ready to drop with running : Pre-eminent Madam can see how out of breath I am .
It was the human being .
It would go here , and it would n't go there , and it contradicted , and it sat down , and it scolded , and it disrespected me  and it 's a wonder I ever got here at all . ''
`` That is serious , '' said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
`` The Queen understood it had been perfectly tamed .
It will have to be taught by severe measures , poor thing .
Go to your place , Seventy Seven And A Half : your excuse is sufficient . ''
As she turned from the Under Royal Wardrobe-maid she perceived Daffodil , and was startled into a little croak of surprise followed by a pause of speechless amazement .
`` Is this the being Her Majesty desires us to dress ! ''
she gasped , rather than said .
And every frog of her staff made gestures of despair or contempt , and croaked in sympathy .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary had but the day before returned from a month 's retirement in a secluded wardrobe of her own to which she withdrew at times , with only one trusted attendant , to page : 73 give herself up undisturbed to her inspirations and carry out new inventions  consequently she had not been present at either of Daffodil 's appearances in the Great Throne Hall .
`` What can this wear ? ''
she said mournfully , `` I had planned - but no matter what I planned .
It was described to me as but an ill-contrived frog in form : but look at it !
it is all in and out and round about .
And its complexion !
like a trout 's flesh .
And that ball on a peg for a head !
- like a button mushroom .
What can it wear ? '' ''
As these remarks were divided from each other by minutes of reflection and by sighs of discouragement , Daffodil had time to think for herself .
`` Pre-eminent Madam , '' she said - first however making one of her successful curtseys , `` if you will give me leave to choose for myself in the wardrobe , I think I can contrive a set of clothes that I can wear . ''
`` And so you shall , '' cried the Plenipotentiary , much relieved .
`` And to me , '' she continued , addressing the assembled staff , `` and to me this shall be an opportunity of investigation and , who knows , perhaps of improvement .
Who knows but what from the unsophisticated choice of this simple savage I may gain some needed lesson . ''
`` No !
No !
NO !!! ''
burst from the staff in chorus .
`` You are wrong , my friends  '' said the Plenipotentiary .
`` I have still much to learn , that ... '' but here the staff broke in with `` NO !!!!!! '' in a deprecating shout .
`` So very much to learn , '' resumed the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , `` that even this poor creature may teach me somewhat .
Ah , my friends , genius page : 74 - if I may venture to hope there is genius in my weak brain and faltering hand - genius is known by being ever a learner , and the more it is the more it knows that it is n't . ''
Murmurs of admiration went through the rows of frogs .
The Plenipotentiary waited till they had died away , and then called on the Head Royal Dresspicker to attend her and bring half a dozen of her assistants , and , with no larger suite , she walked off into the Royal Wardrobe with Daffodil by her side .
Daffodil had been told to turn which way she pleased and guide the party .
The first thing she did was to hurry to a group of white water-lilies and take hold of the largest .
A shriek burst forth from the Plenipotentiary and her attendants and was echoed from the saloon by the frogs within , who had sprung to the waterfall window to see what was the matter .
Daffodil gave up her intention of breaking the lily off its stalk , and waited .
The Plenipotentiary herself explained to her the cause of the consternation .
The water-lilies were sacred to Royalty in the most special manner .
Excepting the Queen , who wore one on the anniversary of her wedding day , and only then , none might be clad in them but a Royal Princess , or the bride of a Royal Prince , at her marriage .
These splendid flowers , with petal on petal of a radiant white that seemed to hold sunlight in them , were difficult to bring to perfection , and the few they were looking on were , the Plenipotentiary said , all that existed , for it would be the highest treason for a subject to possess one .
No marriage in the Royal Family could be duly page : 75 solemnised unless the bride wore this lily dress .
When one was to be used , the Queen herself selected which it should be , and it might only be picked in her presence and by the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary herself , assisted by the Head Royal Dresspicker in right of her office .
`` And one of those you actually almost gathered !!! ''
the Plenipotentiary concluded , in a tone thrilled with horror .
`` Do n't you think it will be the best way for me to be taken to a part of the wardrobe where there are not such very particular flowers ? ''
suggested Daffodil .
`` It will certainly be more prudent to turn back from here  because the clothes growing here are what the Queen herself wears , though they are not all forbidden to subjects . ''
`` May I go where your dress was picked ? ''
There was a movement of indignation among the attendants at the impertinence of this request .
But the Plenipotentiary , after she had recovered from the shock of the surprise , saw that Daffodil was not conscious of presumption , and she felt amused .
`` My own shelves are close at hand , to the left , '' was all she replied .
All the shelves in the part of the Plenipotentiary 's enclosure in which she kept her dresses were filled chiefly with flowers of bell shapes .
Daffodil recognised among them the beautiful pink heath of which the tunic she so greatly admired was made , and she was tempted to make her choice of that : but she felt that it would not be pleasant to the Plenipotentiary , who , as she had perceived , was deliberately unlike every one else , to have somebody page : 76 wearing a fellow tunic to the one she had on .
She stopped before a crowded stalk of wild bluebells and asked if she might take the longest she could find for her dress .
`` Not badly chosen , '' said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
`` I wear those frequently .
It has an instinct much like taste , '' she remarked to the attendants .
`` But your Pre-eminence will not allow it to degrade one of your own costumes ? ''
said the Head Royal Dresspicker .
`` Why not ? ''
answered the Plenipotentiary , unpretendingly .
`` The poor thing may be worthier of good clothes than I , for all we know .
I would not be arrogant .
And perhaps , after all , some might say , judging as so many do beyond my merit , that what I please to wear no other use , however base , can degrade .
The phosphorescence of genius , if it lights even a sullied pool , makes that pool resplendent . ''
So Daffodil was allowed a bluebell tunic .
Croäxaxicans do not use under-clothing , and Daffodil caused considerable surprise by asking for some : but she was shown some white harebells from which she chose another tunic to wear inside her bluebell .
She was offered flowers for the fashionable leggings and for sleeves of the same style , or for puff sleeves , pouch sleeves , bell sleeves , butterfly sleeves , all of which were in favour with the leaders of high society  but she noticed the Plenipotentiary 's own avoidance of embellishments , and resolved to make her her model .
Only , after the dressmakers had prepared her tunics in the page : 77 workroom and had put into her bluebell some frilling of a peculiar pale kind of daisy she had selected , and when the Head Royal Lady 's - maid and six of her staff had assisted her to dress , she found it would be much to her comfort if her tunics could be gathered in at the waist , instead of standing out all round her in a wide stiff bell , and she asked to be allowed a sash .
The Head Lady 's - maid was shocked , and so , of course , were her subordinates .
`` A sash with a bell-flower tunic ! ''
gasped the Head Royal Lady 's - maid , and said no more .
But the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , who had herself accompanied Daffodil to the dressing-room , said quietly , `` Let it have its way , '' and led her back to the wardrobe , attended as before by the dresspickers , to choose what she wished .
Daffodil quickly found some broad flexible leaves which seemed to be of the kind known as gardener 's garters , only softer , as well as larger .
In the dressing-room , when she was putting on this sash , she took from the soiled frock she had taken off a pin that had fastened to it the strange flower which had been the cause of her visit to Croäxaxica .
The flower had disappeared , having vanished the moment she entered Croäxaxica , but there was the pin where it had been .
`` Pre-eminent Madam , '' said the Head Royal Lady 's - maid , `` do you see what it is going to do ? ''
The Plenipotentiary , who had been looking another way , did not know that Daffodil had taken an article from her soiled clothes to wear again - a thing too unexpected to seem possible .
What struck her at once was the extraordinary size and clumsi - page : 78 ness of the strange implement .
`` Take its weapon from it , take its weapon from it , '' she screamed .
`` It is going to run it into its body and kill itself , and what will the Queen say ? ''
`` I am only pinning my sash , '' said Daffodil .
But she dropped the pin in the confusion the Plenipotentiary 's agitation had caused her , and it was sought for in vain .
`` I should have liked to put the thing into the Royal Public Museum , '' said the Plenipotentiary , regretfully .
`` And now it is buried for ever under the carpet . ''
Daffodil thought perhaps she might find another in the clothes she had cast off , and began to hunt for one .
`` Another ! ''
exclaimed the Plenipotentiary .
`` Are you so daring that it should be likely you were carrying two of those implements upon you ? ''
And I fear she and the attendants scarcely believed Daffodil 's account of her nation 's manners with regard to pins .
No other pin was found for the museum .
Daffodil 's sash was fastened by the lady 's - maids with stitches of the minute and almost invisible fish-bones which the wealthier Croäxaxicans use for the purposes for which we have needles and thread and pins .
Those who have to consult economy use instead of fish-bones delicate prickles from the stalks of a plant which grows wild in profusion along the highway and byway canals .
Daffodil could not help feeling a little mournful as , when her toilet was completed , she heard the order that all the things she had taken off were to be removed by the under wardrobe-maids and given page : 79 to the Royal Clothes-Buriers to be put underground .
She particularly regretted her stockings .
And , although she found her new shoes of pale yellow foxglove very soft and easy , she thought that , if she should ever be again where there was hard ground to tread on , her leather ones that were going to be sunk under the mud and weeds in the Royal Clothes-Bin , would be more serviceable .
But she felt herself so much more comfortable in her new attire , which did not cling and drip with its wettings as her own had done , and she was so well pleased with her pretty bluebell frock , that she soon recovered from her vexation .
She had some time to rest before the critical event of her audience with the Queen , for by when the Plenipotentiary was able to send word that the human being was in a state to wait upon Her Majesty , Her Majesty was at lunch , and sent word that she would inspect the creature in the evening .
This was the pleasantest day Daffodil had had yet since her arrival in Croäxaxica .
She walked among the wonderful flowers of the wardrobe , and the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary herself , who seemed to take an interest in her , took her into the palace gardens , and then into the Royal Larder Ground , which to Daffodil seemed more like a garden than the real gardens , and showed her the water-cress pools and the minnow pools .
And she found much pleasure in watching the work of the Plenipotentiary staff , and after a while , when the frogs found that her questions showed intelligence , they took good-humored notice of her , and explained what they were doing .
And at last the Head Royal Dress - page : 80 maker amused herself by teaching her how to join a seam , in which the pupil succeeded so well , for a first attempt , that there were cries of astonishment and the piece of work was carried to the Plenipotentiary , who gave orders that it should be put aside to be shown the Queen that evening .
The frogs tried , too , to teach her to join in their choruses as they sat at their work : but in this she was less successful , not being able to catch the tune , and sometimes putting the other singers out of time , which they did not like .
Still it was all very pleasant , and Daffodil began to think she might not be so unsuited to Croäxaxican life as she had feared .
She got something to eat , too , which she liked better than minnows .
The Plenipotentiary chose to see her take her food , and , noticing that of what was set before her she ate nothing but water-cresses , she asked her if she could name anything else that would tempt her appetite .
`` I think I have learnt to get on with mussels , '' said Daffodil .
`` I managed them best of all the things I have had , except water-cresses . ''
`` You have a dainty palate , I see , '' said the Plenipotentiary , laughing .
`` But you shall have your mussels , and anything else you like . ''
`` Then , please , Pre-eminent Madam , '' said Daffodil , `` let me have some button mushrooms instead . ''
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary staggered as if she had been shot .
The solemn frogs in Royal Livery who were waiting at table each dropped what he was holding .
Amid the smashing sound of glass and china , the Plenipotentiary and her startled followers gasped out `` Mushrooms ! ''
page : 81 `` Where can it have heard of mushrooms ? ''
said the Plenipotentiary .
`` You said my head was like one , '' said Daffodil  `` so I supposed they grew in this country . ''
`` They do , they do , '' sighed the Plenipotentiary .
`` We do n't object to that , for it is impossible to help it .
They grow everywhere in millions - a hundred kinds .
As a feature in the landscape we do n't object to them : but the lower classes eat them ! ''
`` They are poisonous kinds , I suppose , '' said Daffodil .
`` What a pity ! ''
`` No , they are far from being poisonous : they are exceptionally wholesome and nutritious .
But there are millions of millions of them . ''
`` But one of the Royal Dressmakers told me those little toadstools of your bracelets are real ones , '' Daffodil remarked .
`` To be sure they are .
Do you think the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica would wear imitation jewellery ?
But what has that to do with mushrooms ? ''
`` I was only thinking that toadstools are much commoner than mushrooms . ''
Daffodil 's argument was answered by peals of laughter all round .
`` You do not know what you are talking about , poor thing , '' said the Plenipotentiary , when she could speak .
`` There is no relation between the choice treasure , the toadstool , and the homeliest of edibles , the mushroom .
And the toadstool is as rare as it is precious : there never was but one toad in Croäxaxica , and he only sat upon one stool .
The original toadstool has long since perished , but others have sprung page : 82 from it .
To preserve their worth never more than one bud a day is allowed to live .
If there should be a second on the same day it is destroyed , even if it is of a choicer colour .
Look at these of mine - ` Matchless as their talented wearer 's soul , ' Prince Brekekex acutely , though too flatteringly , says : you will not find two of precisely the same tint any more than you could find me repeating my humble masterpieces . ''
Daffodil praised the toadstools , but she returned to the subject of mushrooms .
Might she have some , though they were so common ?
She was not a high personage , but only a little girl : and then she was so hungry and , if the mushrooms were so wholesome and nutritious , they would do her so much good .
`` They are the creature 's natural food , I will let her follow her instincts , '' said the Plenipotentiary , and sent for mushrooms .
And , when they came , several sorts in different dishes that she might choose , Daffodil found that some tasted like chicken , and some like roast mutton , and some like what she was accustomed to in mushrooms , and some like mashed potato .
And she thought to herself that she need not starve among the inimitable Croäxaxicans , for , even if mushrooms were too vulgar to be served to her at meals , she could gather some every day from among the millions the Plenipotentiary had told her of .
Naturally as , well clothed , well fed , and at rest from lessons and anxieties , she recovered full possession of her thoughts , she began to wonder how she was to get back to her parents .
They would not be anxious about her at present , she reflected , as page : 83 they would think she was among the river people , whom they had given her leave to visit if ever she had an opportunity  but they would not approve of a long absence .
And she would be unhappy if she could not return to them as soon as she had seen a little more of the foreign country she had accidentally reached .
She did not perceive that there was a way out , but , as she reasoned , a few days ago she had not yet perceived that there was a way in , so that was no reason for uneasiness .
Thus , with composed mind , she turned to nearer matters and awaited the summons of the Queen .
page : 84 CHAPTER VII .
THE Queen of Croäxaxica was no ordinary person , even if she had not been a Queen .
She could not do anything three times in the same way , like persons of less originality .
She had given Daffodil audience in the Throne Room on two occasions  it was , therefore , indispensable that the interview now should be a private one .
Moreover , Her Majesty wished for a Sociable Evening , such as she sometimes unbent to enjoy , when her guests - among whom she was careful on such occasions to have some of the most renowned philosophers , authors , and wits of Croäxaxica - were allowed to listen to her conversation with her family , and even , from time to time , when she looked as if she intended it , themselves to offer a remark or a reply .
These Sociable Evenings , which their infrequency , their freedom from ceremony , and the choice brilliancy of the company , rendered celebrated as the highest intellectual recreation in the world , had , when Her Majesty first began them , been looked on a little doubtfully by the Prime Minister , who feared they might give the irreverent a perverted idea of Her Majesty as one to be looked on as an agreeable hostess : and later , when he was sacrificing page : 85 his loyalty to his ambition , he characterised them as Orgies of condescension .
But it proved that the impressiveness of the Queen and the Royal Family on the minds of the Croäxaxicans was augmented , rather than lessened , by the reports of these unostentatious festivities , in which , without the protection of guards , excepting one simple policeman behind each Royal seat , they stooped as near as they could to the level of the subjects around them , and inspired them with the greater awe by their affable attempts .
It had struck the Queen all at once that she had not given a Sociable Evening for an unusually long time , and that the interview she meant to grant the human being would be an excellent occasion for one .
She had , thereupon , sent orders to suitable guests to have the honour of enjoying themselves in her presence that evening , and , when Daffodil , at the appointed moment by the clock , was led by the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary into the splendidly decorated room which was known as the Queen 's Royal Sociability Drawing-room , a hundred frogs of those most distinguished in Croäxaxica for rank , wealth , fashion , beauty , dancing , singing , genius , learning , leaping , swimming and architecture , were sitting and standing in orderly rows , gazing at the Queen , the Crown Prince , Prince Brekekex , and the four of the Royal Princesses who were old enough to be allowed to appear .
The King was not present : he never came to any but State entertainments .
The Royal Family were seated together at the upper and broadest end of the apartment - which was of the shape of an egg with its small end elongated and narrowed almost into a point .
Behind the Royal page : 86 Family , their Lords and Ladies in Waiting were ranged along the curve of the wall - apparently standing , but in fact it was so managed by the shape and height of their seats that they should have the advantage of sitting while they looked as if they were bolt upright on their feet .
This arrangement was the result of the kindly thoughtfulness of the Queen herself , in consequence of the Lords and Ladies in Waiting having been perpetually fainting away while she required them to stand so many hours as her Sociable Evenings usually lasted .
She had regrets that she could not provide them with chairs  but power has its limits and that , she felt , was impossible even to the Queen of the inimitable Croäxaxicans : for , if Lords and Ladies in Waiting quietly sat down and looked comfortable , how could they be in waiting more than the guests ?
At last it flashed upon her one evening , when thirteen Lords and two Ladies had been carried out in swoons , that , if somebody could make some sort of contrivance to enable these distinguished attendants to be seated without betraying it by their attitude , a stop might be put to their fainting .
So she ordered all the upholsterers in the kingdom to meet in council and carry out her invention .
This matter of the seats won the Queen great applause , because , as all the Croäxaxican newspapers pointed out , it showed that , though she was a Queen , she felt a sympathy for her sex , and all the Ladies in Waiting ought to be ready to give their lives for such a mistress .
The Ladies in Waiting gave her a magnificent diadem of snail-shells in memory of her goodness , and the Lords in Waiting came to the presentation of it and unanimously delivered a speech page : 87 in which they heaped praises on her for her Royal and tender consideration for their colleagues in office , the Ladies in Waiting .
The Queen was so pleased that she had ever since been looking for something to do for her sex again .
I have digressed to relate this celebrated episode in the history of Croäxaxica .
I must return to what met Daffodil 's eyes .
Of what met her ears there is nothing to describe , for it happened that the conversation just then was between the two youngest Princesses , and they were whispering .
The Royal Family , then , were seated in mere arm-chairs placed in a semicircle .
The Queen herself sat unpretentiously in the middle chair , without dais or canopy .
She had , as her custom was on Sociable Evenings , sent away her sceptre as soon as she had taken her seat , and she wore her crown a little on one side - an assumed mark of carelessness which was understood to express the informality of the occasion .
She was lying back in a pensive and easy posture , and might have been thought asleep , if she had not been languidly stroking a pet oyster on her lap .
The room was ablaze with fountains and canals of a dozen different tints variegating the light , and the whole of the walls and ceiling sparkled with luminous drops .
`` The light is like fairyland , '' whispered Daffodil .
`` Hush ! ''
the Plenipotentiary whispered back .
`` Do n't say fairy .
The Queen is practical and she gets angry at any visionary talk . ''
`` I 'll take care , '' Daffodil returned .
`` But do n't you feel as if fairies had made these lights ? ''
`` Croäxaxicans do not approve of fairies  because page : 88 there are none , '' said the Plenipotentiary , severely .
`` And hush !
for we 're getting within hearing .
Now , mind what I told you : do n't open your lips unless the Queen wants you to say something . ''
When the Plenipotentiary had arrived at the seat reserved for her , which , in right of her being the highest subject in the kingdom , was straight opposite the Queen and a little nearer her than any one else 's , she stood by it silently , as was the proper etiquette , waiting till the Queen should perceive her .
She was puzzled what to do with her charge - for whom there was no precedent - so she took the plan she had so successfully devised for dressing her , and let her manage for herself .
And Daffodil , therefore , to the amazement of the assembly , was beheld quietly standing side by side with the first frog of the Croäxaxican aristocracy , as if she were her equal and entitled to a like recognition from Royalty .
After a minute or so the Queen looked at the Plenipotentiary , and nodded .
Then the Plenipotentiary , folding her hands on her breast , sank gently into her seat .
Daffodil , having no seat to sink into , was perplexed for a moment  but , recovering her presence of mind , she imitated the Plenipotentiary 's action by setting herself on the floor at her feet .
`` Ah , what was it you were saying , my dear boy ? ''
said the Queen presently , breaking the silence .
`` My dancing , was it ? ''
`` I was n't saying a word , '' replied the Crown Prince , whom she had addressed .
`` My dancing , '' murmured the Queen .
`` Ah , well !
perhaps I could dance once .
But Royalty has scant time for practising its steps . ''
page : 89 `` Oh Mother , prance , entrance , elegance , enhance by chance the glance of dance , '' exclaimed Prince Brekekex emphatically .
It had been arranged that the Crown Prince should suggest the Queen 's dancing , and that Prince Brekekex should urge it in a burst of poetry .
But the Crown Prince had forgotten what the Queen had told him to do and had missed her signal .
And Prince Brekekex had not had time enough given for him to complete a poem .
The Queen had only told him about it a little while before the party began , and moreover she had said it would be after her reception of the new creature : so , although he had been preparing his speech in his mind ever since the Sociable Evening began , he had only been able to get ready the rhymes .
Called on in a hurry , he was equal to the occasion , and poured forth the rhymes in an eloquent flow .
Their effect was electrical .
`` Dance , '' said everybody .
`` Glance .
Entrance us !
Oh !
if Her Majesty would but do it !
Prance , prance !
The very word !
Oh !
let Her Majesty enhance her elegance , and dance ! ''
The Queen smiled , and arose .
And she danced .
Words can not describe that dancing .
With grave composure she sprang and shuffled and hopped and pirouetted .
She made twenty steps in an inch , she made strides of thrice her height .
Nobody could dance like the Queen of Croäxaxica .
The frogs were carried away with enthusiasm .
Their applause , at first soft sighs and spasms of delight , grew louder and stronger into jubilant shouts  then they clapped their hands and feet together , and at last some of them even began to dance , themselves .
page : 90 But the Queen , who had all the while retained the air of thoughtful dignity habitual to her and who was not in the least excited by the approbation and flattering uproar , as soon as she saw that the limits of decorum were being passed , gave one bound into her chair from ten feet off and said , in a clear quiet voice , `` I am glad you like that step , Brekekex  it was impromptu . ''
And , conversation being thus re-established , there was an instant hush .
`` You have a little anecdote to tell me , I think , '' said the Queen to the Crown Prince , after a pause .
The Crown Prince was in his heart uneasy about being at the Sociable Evenings at all .
He thought that , as a future King , he could not isolate himself too early , and he was only induced to be present , and to take some part in the conversation , by his necessary obedience to Her Majesty and his strong desire to be popular .
So it was in a curt and surly tone that he answered `` I heard that the Regius Professor of Everything heard two soldiers talking , and one boasted that he had an oyster which was the biggest and tamest in Croäxaxica , and the other said ' I suppose he likes his master . ' ''
He could not help bursting into a laugh as he ended , although he tried hard not to do so  and his laugh was echoed and re-echoed in louder and louder bursts throughout the assembly .
But the Regius Professor of Everything , who was one of the guests , took advantage of the noise to keep saying to his neighbours `` That was n't the point : what the other frog said to the soldier was ' I suppose he is like his master . '
And you know big soldiers ought not to be tame . ''
However , every one was too busy laughing to listen to him .
page : 91 After the enjoyment of the Crown Prince 's anecdote had subsided , there was a long interval of conversation again .
The Queen made a remark every ten minutes or so , usually to a member of her Royal Family , and the person addressed answered it in the affirmative .
The Crown Prince seemed asleep , but he was only imitating his Royal Father 's demeanour  Prince Brekekex seemed asleep , but he was preparing answers , as he had to speak in verse  the Princesses tittered together and seemed amused - all but the youngest one and she did really keep falling asleep .
She was always betraying the accident by a gurgling in her nose , and then one of her sisters would sedately give her a secret pinch which immediately revived her .
At last the Queen , arousing herself from a rather long caressing of her oyster , observed `` We have had quite a long conversation this time : I am sure it must have lasted over three hours . ''
`` I am sure it must , '' assented the Head Royal Physician  for it was to him the Queen had looked  `` Five hours , I should say . ''
`` Sir ! ''
exclaimed Her Majesty .
The Head Royal Physician saw that he had somehow not said what Her Majesty meant .
He was forced to have a cough , and , when the cough had once begun , it set up an irritation in his windpipe and he was half choked before he could stop .
That gave him time for reflection , and he resumed his sentence thus : `` Five hours , for the impressions it will leave on my enriched mind  two hours , in point of brevity and absence of fatigue . ''
`` A graceful flattery , '' said the Queen , with a smile .
page : 92 `` But you , inestimably talented friend , must not learn to play the compliment-maker : we look to you for grave sincerity .
The time , by my watch , was three hours , one minute . ''
Then , turning , still with an affable sprightliness , to an enormously fat frog who had volunteered , somewhat against etiquette , the observation `` True !
Most true ! ''
to the last speech of the Head Royal Physician , she said `` I know that the ears of the first musician of the world are pining for sweet sounds . ''
The frog to whom she spoke was renowned throughout Croäxaxica , not only as the greatest of musical composers , but as unequalled as an instrumentalist - his instrument being , of course , the big drum .
And , although his voice had somewhat lost its youthful volume , his singing was still remarkable .
He was an accomplished courtier and much in favour with the Queen , who was fond of performing to him on his own instrument , on which she had considerable skill .
He hesitated at present , for he did not wish to say his ears were pining for anything but what they had been hearing , and yet he must wish for the Queen 's music .
But he saw his way .
He threw his arms in the air , gazed upwards with emotion , and ejaculated `` Oh , soul of music !
Oh , Her Majesty on the drum ! ''
`` The Princesses shall grant your request and sing for you , '' said the Queen .
`` And this evening it shall be no new fashionable bravura such as they generally use for my guests ' delight , but they are going to sing our old immortal national song .
My guests can tell Croäxaxica that they have heard the words known to the humblest of our subjects upon the lips of the children of Royalty . ''
page : 93 The guests were all really pleased at this , for they were very fond of the national song , and they thought it would enliven the evening .
They at once assumed their most expectant and ecstatic expressions of countenance .
Two drums were brought  the small one was for Prince Brekekex , the big one was placed before the Queen .
Then , with the amount of difficulty and conference usual when an amateur performance is about to take place , the Princesses got themselves into line .
The Queen executed a brilliant prelude with hardly any mistakes  then Prince Brekekex joined in and the Princesses knew it was time for them all to begin .
Properly they ought to have started very loud , but , as their voices were not powerful , and as the first verse of the Croäxaxican national song is always made louder and louder at each word until it ends with the loudest possible shout , it was necessary for them to begin in a tone whose moderation startled the audience far more than thrice the noise could have done , and which , therefore , was highly effective .
This was what they sang , accompanied by the vigorous thunder of the Queen and the delicate tappings of Prince Brekekex , `` Oh Strong !
Oh Great !
Oh Brave !
Oh Bright !
Croäxaxicans !!!
How proud our state !
How well we fight !
Croäxaxicans !!!! All the world kneels down and wonders  All the world obeys our thunders  Everything we do is right .
Who can contradict the warlike plans Of us Inimitable Croäxaxicans ?!!!!! '' page : 94 This was the first verse  and its patriotic storm whirled the hearers ' hearts into wild enthusiasm .
The second verse of this truly national song is always sung with peculiar gentleness , the tones becoming softer and tenderer at every line , in order the better to impress on the listener the beneficent mildness of the Croäxaxicans in their peaceful capacity .
I say the listener , but , of course , when this song was sung it was rare in the extreme that there should be a listener , as everybody would , as a general rule , be singing it .
On this occasion , from the rank of the singers , the audience had the unusual advantage of hearing their national song instead of joining in the performance  The Princesses executed the gradual lowering of their voices really very well - in fact so well that the Queen 's accompaniment drowned their voices completely in the last three lines , causing them to look as if they were opening and shutting their mouths for no particular purpose .
But I will give the verse in its entirety , as they did in fact sing it , though they did not happen to be heard .
`` Oh Good !
Oh True !
Oh Wise !
Oh Sweet !
Croäxaxicans !
What things we do !
What praise we meet !
Croäxaxicans !!!
All the world was born to note us : We , born chief , yet still promote us : Nought with us can ere compete .
Who can emulate the peaceful plans Of us Inimitable Croäxaxicans ?!!!!!!! '' It is customary when this second verse has died off in an affectionate lingering sound like a long kiss , page : 95 for all present to undertake a vociferous shout of `` Croäxaxicans !
Croäxaxicans !
Inimitable , Inimitable , Croäxaxicans ! ''
in chorus for about an hour , and the Queen 's guests entertained hopes that they were to refresh themselves in this accustomed manner .
But Her Majesty , who saw the danger that their enthusiasm might carry them into this excess , with great promptitude threw down her drumsticks while the Princesses still had their mouths open for the last word , and called out `` Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , produce the human being . ''
Daffodil was produced .
The Queen had known very well she was there , but the fact was her dressing had been so successful that Her Majesty , on seeing her had resolved in her own mind that she was of sufficient importance to have an impression made upon her , and therefore , instead of proceeding to hold the investigation concerning her when , at the time appointed , she arrived for the purpose , had set about first dazzling her with the brilliancy of the entertainment and Her own Royal accomplishments .
Thus Her Majesty had become too tired for the searching inquiry into all Daffodil 's history , origin , laws , manners , customs , intentions , education , and general opinions , which she had meant to pursue to the admiration of her guests and attendants .
She contented herself with obtaining the information that Daffodil was really a human being , as her acuteness had already surmised , and that she had accidentally entered Croäxaxica while in search of another country .
`` That is satisfactory enough , '' said she , interrupting Daffodil 's story .
`` But , now you are here , page : 96 what can I do with you ?
It is impossible to let you stay here unofficially .
Everybody in this Court is understood to be in our Royal Service .
What can you do to serve us ? ''
Daffodil could not think of anything .
`` Can you make jokes ? ''
said the Queen .
Daffodil had never tried much , but she supposed anybody could do that that tried hard enough .
`` Not at all , '' replied the Queen .
`` I could n't .
I should not think of degrading myself by being able to make a joke .
We do n't make jokes in Croäxaxica .
But in very ancient times Royal Persons had people of an odd and deformed appearance to make jokes for them : and I think I will revive the office for you . ''
`` I should n't like the appointment at all , your Majesty , '' said Daffodil .
`` Never mind , '' replied the Queen : `` I will waive your liking it .
The question is can you make jokes ? ''
`` Not unless I were to try , '' answered Daffodil .
`` Well , it is of no consequence , '' said the Queen .
`` I could not be troubled with listening to jokes .
So that is settled .
You are hereby appointed My Majesty 's Private Royal Jester .
Your mark of office will be a band of green and orange grass round the left arm , with a heart of carved fish-bone lettered H.M.P.R.J. for clasp . ''
The Plenipotentiary here asked to be allowed to show Daffodil 's first attempt at needlework .
The Queen was greatly struck by it .
`` Let her , '' said she , `` be entrusted with the making of my third best pocket-handkerchiefs .
They shall be henceforth called jokes  and thus she will make jokes and fill page : 97 her new post appropriately . ''
And , being now tired and sleepy , she gave a nod to the room for good-night , and hurried off so suddenly that the Lords and Ladies in Waiting could not get off their seats in time to overtake her .
The fact was she was seized by a fit of yawning , and , as she had an unusually small mouth - the one defect in what would have otherwise been a strikingly perfect countenance - the operation of yawning was difficult and unbecoming to her , and she did not choose to be seen in it .
At once , on Her Majesty 's departure , the Princes and Princesses nodded as she had done and rushed after her .
The policemen behind the Royal Chairs advanced in a line and said to the assembly `` Move on , this meeting has become illegal , '' and everybody hurried off as fast as possible .
`` Her Majesty 's Private Royal Jester , where do you pass the night ? ''
said the Plenipotentiary .
`` Oh , I 'm sure I do n't know , '' said Daffodil distractedly .
`` What 's the use of making such an appointment as that and not giving me so much as a bed to sleep in ?
Ca n't I be with the third best pocket-handkerchiefs ? ''
`` A good idea , '' replied the kindly great lady - relieved , for she had been thinking her duty would be to leave Daffodil to the policemen to take in charge .
`` Your duties to the Royal Pocket-handkerchiefs put you on my staff and allow me to lodge you near them .
Come with me . ''
And thus Daffodil obtained a rank at the Court of Croäxaxica , and , as the Queen approved of the arrangement of the Plenipotentiary , a home in the apartments of the Royal Wardrobe .
page : 98 CHAPTER VIII .
WE need not follow day by day our heroine 's life in Croäxaxica .
Although , as is the case with all who find themselves in a foreign country without any knowledge , by reading or hearsay , of its manners and customs , she was for a long time always meeting with surprises in even the commonest details of life , yet the account we have given of her earliest experiences will serve to convey a sufficient idea of her new surroundings .
And the limits of our story do not allow of our entering upon a careful description of all she saw and learnt .
For some months , she continued , as Her Majesty 's Private Royal Jester , in charge of the third best pocket-handkerchiefs : and , being thus admitted to the work-rooms of the Plenipotentiary Department , she amused herself with learning all the methods of the Plenipotentiary Art , and soon became a very fair dressmaker .
She was a favourite with all the members of the staff of every grade , and all took pleasure in answering her questions and teaching her .
Her ignorance and her quickness at learning alike inspired them with interest in her attempts , and their sense of superiority to her as one of an inferior page : 99 race prevented the possibility of any little grudges and jealousies against her , such as the indulgence with which she was treated might have called forth if any one could have regarded her as a rival .
The same inferiority which rendered her position among the members of the Plenipotentiary staff so agreeable gave her an extraordinary footing of intimacy with the Royal Family .
Looking on her as of the lower animals , they made no scruple of treating her as one of themselves .
She was encouraged to question and reply , she was allowed to sit in their presence , and even to move about the room .
Notice was taken of her likes and dislikes  and her sayings were quoted with delighted recognition of their intelligence .
Such a state of things could not have existed if it had not been felt that Daffodil , in any breach of etiquette she was allowed , could be no more guilty of presumption than a pet oyster or beetle .
Lowliness has its privileges .
Very early in her career at the Croäxaxican Court , Daffodil had an opportunity of using her position as a favourite to do a kind action .
One morning Under Royal Wardrobe-maid Number Seventy Seven And A Half came to her with her face swelled to twice the width of her body by her having cried so much .
`` Oh you darling wonderful creature , '' she said , `` Oh , my dear Her Majesty 's Private Royal Jester , I know you can save me : do try . ''
`` What is it , Seventy Seven And A Half ? ''
said Daffodil .
`` I will help you , if I can , and if it is not anything wrong you want me to do . ''
`` I 'm oh so sorry I put the blame on you about page : 100 our being late that day '' said Seventy Seven And A Half .
`` It was a shame . ''
`` It was , '' said Daffodil .
`` You were very mean to do that . ''
At that poor Seventy Seven And A Half began to sob and wail so desperately that it sounded as if variations were being played on the bagpipes .
It was a long while before Daffodil could get her composed enough to tell her trouble intelligibly .
At last the matter became plain .
When the Royal Nurse-maids with their Royal Charges had come into the garden while Daffodil and Seventy Seven And A Half were there , they had not , as Seventy Seven And A Half had hoped , been still too much dazzled to perceive her  but they had not seen Daffodil , because she had been standing in such a position that the spray of a waterfall intervened between them and her , so as to conceal her from their view .
The nurse-maids had taken an opportunity of telling the Queen of the trespasser they had seen , and , on inquiry being made as to which of the Under Royal Wardrobe-maids had been absent from her post at the time the offence was committed , it was ascertained that every one of them had witnesses to her having been in her right place except Seventy Seven And A Half  and , although she had been on her important duty of fetching Daffodil , which might have accounted for her , it was remembered that her absence had been surprisingly long , and also that she had declared the delay due to the unmanageable conduct of the human being , while every one else had found the human being remarkably tractable after the Regius Professor of Everything had educated it .
Over - page : 101 whelmed by this evidence , Seventy Seven And A Half confessed her guilt .
As the best excuse she could make , she pleaded that she had gone to the garden for the human being 's sake , out of an idea that she was to do all she could to please it .
But this excuse only made things look blacker for her , as the Royal Nurse-maids affirmed that the human being had not been with her in the garden , and , when the two little Royal Highnesses were asked about it , they both said , as well as they could manage to explain themselves in their infantine language , that a servant was looking at the garden but that there was not any funny beast with her .
Moreover poor Seventy Seven And A Half had once before been caught trespassing in the Queen 's Royal Private Garden .
Her Majesty resolved now to punish her with a severity which should deter all others from committing a like fault .
As to the question about Daffodil , Her Majesty had refused to have Daffodil 's evidence asked for , considering that it would be undignified to seek confirmation of the opinions of Their Royal Highnesses from a creature who seemed scarcely a frog .
She did not know , she had said severely , what excuse it would have been to Seventy Seven And A Half if she could have proved that Her Majesty 's Royal Private Jester also deserved punishment  certainly her false accusation of a creature whom her Queen looked upon as her own private property , and who , moreover , held a special post in the Royal Service entitling it to a place at Court , was an offence which enhanced her guilt and must remove all possibility of leniency in dealing with it .
Daffodil sat pondering , after she had heard the page : 102 story of Seventy Seven And A Half 's disgrace and danger .
`` Oh !
Oh ! ''
sobbed her suppliant , wringing her paws , `` I know you 're thinking about me saying mischief about you the other day .
I did n't mean to harm you .
It was only for fear of my getting punished .
And , if they had sent you to prison or whipped you or anything , you see , you being a stranger , it would n't have mattered so much to you as my being fined my wages would have to me . ''
`` I am not thinking anything about that , '' said Daffodil .
`` I have told you my opinion about that .
But I hope you wo n't suffer for showing me the garden , though you ought n't to have done it .
And they must n't punish you for saying what is not true , when it is true .
I will go at once to the Queen and tell her so . ''
`` And , if you can save me , you may count on me for anything in the world I can do for you , even if it was something troublesome , '' said Seventy Seven And A Half , fervently .
`` And I 'll never forget it all my days .
But , oh dear and oh dear !
what shall we do if the Queen wo n't forgive me any the more for your telling her that ?
I could n't live to be called Seventy Eight , after having been up to Seventy Seven And A Half . ''
And at this she went into a fit of hysterics .
Daffodil soothed her as well as she could , and urged her to keep quiet that they might not waste time .
`` If I do not go at once , '' she said  `` the orders for carrying out the sentence may be given before I can try to obtain your pardon or a mitigation of the punishment .
But you should tell me what the punish - page : 103 ment is .
Are they going to give you to the State Boa Constrictor ? ''
`` No , '' replied Seventy Seven And A Half , as well as she could speak through her crying .
`` That 's only for the very upperest High Treasoners , that have to be paid a compliment to .
But it 's almost as bad : I 'm to be made Seventy Eight !!!!! '' `` And what is there besides ? ''
inquired Daffodil .
`` Besides ! ''
ejaculated the frog .
`` Do you think there would be a besides to that ? ''
`` It is not quite such a bad thing as I expected to hear , '' said Daffodil .
`` To be Seventy Eight ! ''
gasped the unfortunate Under Royal Wardrobe-maid .
`` But you were Seventy Eight not long ago-before you were promoted in your turn .
And you did not mind it then , I daresay . ''
Even in her present distress , Seventy Seven And A Half could not help showing some resentment at this .
`` I may have been only Seventy Eight some time ago , '' she said , `` though it was scarcely kind of you to remind me of it - we ca n't all begin at the top of the tree when it is the rule that we can only begin at the bottom .
But you may as well remember , yourself , that a few days ago you were n't Her Majesty 's Private Royal Jester .
That 's no reason that it would n't be an awful punishment for you if you were to have to come down from being it . ''
`` Well , '' said Daffodil , `` although I do n't quite feel as you do about the punishment , I can feel that you are very unhappy , and I shall keep my promise .
I will try very hard to have you forgiven . ''
page : 104 Daffodil did try very hard : and she succeeded .
At first she had difficulty in getting the Queen to listen to her about the matter at all - the reason for which was that the Queen did not want to know that Daffodil had been in the garden with Seventy Seven And A Half - both because things were already settled on the understanding that this had not been the case and because she did not wish to have to punish Daffodil as Seventy Seven And A Half 's accomplice and thought the best way not to have to do so was to continue ignorant of the fact .
But Daffodil was so pertinacious that the Queen could not go on not noticing her statement  and , then , Daffodil made so much of the excuse of Seventy Seven And A Half 's good-nature in showing her the garden , and begged so earnestly that she might not be made the cause of so severe an injury to a person whose fault had been on her account , that Her Majesty at last consented to recall her sentence .
Her Majesty , however , still considered that some punishment must be inflicted on the guilty Under Royal Wardrobe-maid : `` And , '' said she , `` how can I punish her and let My Majesty 's Private Royal Jester , who profited in her offence and bore a part in it , go unharmed ? ''
Daffodil saw her opportunity .
`` If you punish a person for going trespassing with me , '' said she , `` you can not help putting me into disgrace too : and if I am in disgrace you will have to take away my post at Court . ''
`` There would be an awkwardness , to be sure , '' replied the Queen in a tone of reflection .
`` But , as I wish you to retain the appointment , I should grant page : 105 your petition for forgiveness , on the ground of your ignorance of the rules . ''
`` But I should not ask one bit for forgiveness , '' said Daffodil .
`` And I should tell everybody so , to make sure they knew . ''
`` Then I should degrade you , '' said the Queen , severely .
`` That is just what I said , '' returned Daffodil .
At last , after much thought , Her Majesty saw her way out of the dilemma .
She was not cruel , and had no desire to punish the offender , except for the sake of example  so she declared it her final decision that Seventy Seven And A Half had not committed any offence , because it had been her duty to keep with Daffodil wherever Daffodil went , and that Daffodil had not committed any offence , because , Seventy Seven And A Half having been duly appointed her guide , she had been bound to follow that guide , but that any person who should imitate the conduct of either of them in accompanying the other into the Queen 's Royal Private Garden without special privilege to do so should receive , not only his or her own punishment , but also the punishment that Seventy Seven And A Half and Daffodil would have had if they had been punished .
That put it all right .
To this episode of the sentence of Seventy Seven And A Half and her pardon at Daffodil 's intercession was owing the commencement of a friendship between Daffodil and Prince Brekekex , which , in spite of the disparity between them , may be called confidential .
The Prince , whose poetic soul was always looking about for themes for his lyre , was page : 106 much pleased with Daffodil 's conduct : she had shown , he said , magnanimity and heroism worthy of one of the inimitable Croäxaxicans themselves , and he perceived a contrast between her savage and ignoble origin and her generous act which he thought he could point out in a poem of a few thousand lines for which he happened at that moment to be in want of a subject .
Accordingly he set to work with great energy , and before the week was over he had almost completed his immortal poem `` Greatness In The Base , '' which every Croäxaxican child learns by heart and every grown-up person is always quoting .
But , though he had almost got to the end , there was a rhyme needed which he could not find to his satisfaction , and for want of it he could not wind up his magnificent concluding burst .
The poem , after relating the final decision of the Queen , proceeds thus - `` Such was the great Queen 's mercy , such her mind  Thus she made wrong be right , and front behind : And all the agonies and shuddering throes Of Seventy Seven And A Half found close : And , Lo !
A Croäxaxican by birth Helped by the lowest creature of the earth !
Thus can a fortnight 's air of our great land Make virtue in a savage heart expand , Thus swell a soul and breathe a froggish sense And fill an odd-shaped mouth with eloquence .
And thus , moreover , I will gladly add Joy fit for frogs the simple savage had  For , to conclude , at which the world will stare , Her Majesty was pleased to , then and there , Pat with her own great hand the human being And - '' But here he was brought to a stop .
He tried `` Looked at her with a kind seeing '' - `` Praised her page : 107 nobly for her noble pleaing '' - `` Bade her no more know fear and think of fleeing '' - `` Smiled on her by way of queenly feeing '' - `` Saw her , grateful , modestly sink kneeing '' - `` Tittered unto her with a soft te-heeing '' - but none of these lines , and no variation he could make upon them , seemed what he wanted .
He went to the Royal Library and turned over every page of book after book , in hopes of meeting with another rhyme that would fit in more acceptably .
While he was thus employed Daffodil happened to come into the room .
`` Come here , Her Majesty 's Royal Private Jester , '' called the despairing Prince  `` Come and see if the poet can strike a spark from even you . ''
And , when she had , wonderingly , taken the seat beside him to which he pointed , he read her the lines we have given as far as `` And - '' `` Do n't you think the poem would be nicer if it did not call me a savage ? ''
said Daffodil .
`` That is not the question , '' replied Prince Brekekex : `` that part is done .
What I want to know is what your poets use as a rhyme to ` human being . '
They must constantly be wanting one , as they are human beings themselves . ''
Daffodil did not remember any poem in which the expression was rhymed to .
But , when the Prince had read her his experiments , she said `` Could n't you say something about the Queen 's decreeing something ? ''
`` Delightful ! ''
said Prince Brekekex .
`` Decreeing !
It exactly conveys my idea .
In fact it is the very word I had in my head and could not find there .
But what can I say she decreed ? ''
page : 108 Daffodil thought it would answer to mention the Queen 's final decision in the case as what she had decreed , but the Prince showed her that would never do , by reading her four hundred lines in which he had already repeated the Queen 's decision .
`` I must get Her Majesty to decree something on purpose for me to put in , '' said he .
`` Is there anything you would like ? ''
`` Nothing in particular , thank you , '' said Daffodil , whose wants were all supplied without her asking , and who accompanied the Royal Family wherever she pleased , so that she had nothing to desire .
The Prince tried hard to get her to think of something , or to think of something himself , for her to have decreed her as a reward : but it was of no use .
The only possibilities seemed promotion or jewellery , and she did not like either .
At last an idea struck her : `` Why not let it be that the decree was that you should make the poem ? ''
It was the very thing .
Off rushed Prince Brekekex to get the Queen to say she decreed it , and in a few minutes he returned to his poem .
He ended it thus - `` And one day soon she spoke a speech decreeing Prince Brekekex himself the tale should tell , To have the world for ever know it well . ''
`` And to think that it is you that have been able to give a hint that has helped me to this climax ! ''
he exclaimed to Daffodil as he threw down his pen .
From that time he frequently consulted her when he could not find a rhyme .
And , as she had a quick ear and a good memory , it proved that , when once page : 109 her attention had been turned in this direction , she developed a remarkable faculty for finding words of the necessary sounds and spellings .
But not only Prince Brekekex found Daffodil his most congenial companion , the Crown Prince , to every one 's surprise , was eager for her society and absolutely loquacious in conversation with her .
The real fact was that the Crown Prince , while , from a sense of his importance to the world and the responsibilities of his future position , he felt it his business to be silent , and while he made it his aim in life to acquire the impressive repose of his Royal Father 's deportment , yet enjoyed the use of speech as much as most people , and , although he had by practice become able rigidly to maintain his rule of only conversing with his equals , or nearly his equals , the other members of the Royal Family , it was a great relief to him to meet with a creature so much of no rank at all that he could talk to her with no more derogation than if she had been his oyster and who yet could understand and reply with the intelligence , as it were , of a natural frog .
There was one strange thing about Daffodil 's present life  and that was that she did not feel the longing for her parents and her home which she would have expected if she had been kept completely from them but a week , or sent to live where she could only come to see them once a day .
The reason for her calmness over the separation lay in the climate of Croäxaxica .
It has the peculiar property of making it difficult - indeed well-nigh impossible - to bear in mind any place but Croäxaxica and any other people than its inhabitants .
Daffodil page : 110 did not lose her memory of her parents , nor yet of Keziah , nor even altogether of her dog and her cat : but it was because , when she perceived , soon after she entered upon her career in Croäxaxica , how strangely far all her home above water seemed to have grown and how seldom she thought about those she loved best , she set herself a sort of task of remembering at a fixed time every day .
But she only succeeded in remembering , and that not very vividly : she could not feel her affection awake , although she was somehow quite sure it was in her as much as ever , only gone to sleep : and , in spite of trying with all her might , she could not make herself unhappy .
And , every time , the moment she left off determining to remember and fixing her whole mind on the effort , she had forgotten altogether .
It was no doubt a good thing for her that she was prevented from useless fretting  but when she did remember she used to feel vexed to think that she generally forgot .
page : 111 CHAPTER IX .
AT the time of Daffodil 's arrival in Croäxaxica a most momentous state question - no less than the marriage of the Crown Prince - was under consideration .
Negotiations had already been begun  ambassadors had been sent by the two Royal Fathers to reside at each other 's courts and devote all their attention to concluding the marriage treaty  special postmen had been appointed to carry the enormous bulk of correspondence  councils of state were being held on the subject two or three times a week  and all the Court of Croäxaxica were thinking what to wear at the wedding .
The arrival of Daffodil , and then the important case of Seventy Seven And A Half , for a while diverted Royal and public attention from the preliminaries of this Royal Alliance , but redoubled diligence was used to make up for that temporary slackening , and , as no difficulties whatever arose , in a few months all was arranged and it only remained for the Crown Prince to make his betrothed Princess his bride .
All Croäxaxica broke into loyal joviality .
The canals swarmed with excited citizens huzzaing , leaping , diving , and exchanging news .
The national page : 112 song was heard everywhere from a thousand voices , morning , noon , and night .
The popularity of the Crown Prince , which had not been remarkable hitherto , became all of a sudden unbounded , and the Crown Princess that was to be was universally declared to be , though unassuming as to beauty and other showy attractions , gifted with graces peculiar to herself which made her the most incomparable Princess in the world .
The event was all the more joyful that there had been great risk of the Crown Prince never being able to marry at all .
For , while the treaty was being begun , the Princess , through the inexcusable carelessness of her attendants , had got lost .
It was several days before it was discovered that she had gone out unperceived and found her way to her future mother-in-law 's Royal Wardrobe , where seeing some Royal Clothes-Buriers carrying a heaped-up basket , she had followed them , from curiosity , and had got thrown into the clothes-bog with the dirty clothes , by mistake .
Being of a docile temper , she had remained where she was put  and , as she showed no more than the tip of her nose above the surface of the bog , she was not observed .
It was only when , a few mornings later , a clothes-burier wished to make a hole just where she was and accidentally shovelled her out , that any trace of her was found .
By that time the search after her had been given up in despair and she was being bewailed as a lost hope of the world .
Had she indeed disappeared irrecoverably , there would have been no one left whom the Crown Prince could marry .
By a fatality which surprised and alarmed the Croäxaxicans , the Royal Matrimonial page : 113 Family of Grachidichika had become well-nigh extinct .
Their Matrimonial Majesties Regnant had only this one child , Grachidichika only this one spinster of Royal and Matrimonial rank .
The Kingdom of Grachidichika , it must be understood , was no rival to Croäxaxica : in fact it only existed for the convenience of that country .
It was of no great size , being in a corner of the Croäxaxican Sovereign 's back garden , from which it was separated by a wide canal encircling it completely , and by , within that , a lofty wall of earth and moss which shut out all view of the kingdom it bounded .
This Matrimonial Estate had been created several centuries before , - none but the Regius Professor of Everything knew under what circumstances .
Finding Daffodil a tractable listener , the Professor was often willing to give her the advantage of his erudition .
And , on the origin of the kingdom of Grachidichika , this is what he told her : The Inimitable Croäxaxicans had not in the earliest ages been an underground people .
They had inhabited territories beside the river above , and had carried on intercourse with the other nations of frogs .
Although , as the Professor 's researches led him to believe , the Croäxaxicans of that period had not attained that magnificent physical development which now characterised them , they were larger and stronger than the kindred races , and they were , he need hardly say , their superiors in intelligence and enterprise .
These circumstances early gave them a moral superiority over the surrounding nations which resulted in their becoming the rulers and proprietors of the other nations ' domains , and page : 114 thus the whole of that part of the world was in a state of peace and good government .
But several fierce and multitudinous nations of frogs occupying the regions of an adjacent lake , not only refused to perceive the natural supremacy of the Croäxaxicans , but were arrogant enough to attempt a rivalry with them .
After many disputes and many reconciliations , a great war broke out - a war such as the world had never known before , nor since .
History , said the Regius Professor of Everything , had omitted to record the events of the war , feeling certain that no one would stand in need of the information , for that the Croäxaxicans had passed from victory to victory was such a fact as every one would be sure to know intuitively .
But , on the successful termination of the war , the inimitable Croäxaxicans had yielded to their feelings of resentment and contempt , and had inflicted a final humiliation on their opponents by withdrawing themselves from their sight and retiring to a proud seclusion underground .
At first they had kept open some ways of communication with the surface , but afterwards they must , for what reasons the Professor could not guess , have ordered their conquered foes to block up every passage  and those inferior frogs , bringing earth and stones from a neighbouring hill till they had taken it nearly all away , succeeded in carrying out the wishes of the inimitable Croäxaxicans and confining them below .
The Croäxaxicans , indeed , afterwards , made a small issue to the surface at a great distance and near the mouth of the river , leading a tunnel along to the aperture .
And it was in this way that they originally obtained the fish and seaweeds , and also the oysters page : 115 and other domestic animals , which had been acclimatised and now were native to their country .
But , shortly after they had completed the colossal labour of this secret tunnel and egress , they had , for motives which history did not reveal , compelled their enemies to undergo the labour of throwing a hill into that opening also .
The tunnel remained , extending far beyond inhabited Croäxaxica for many miles towards the sea , and some sea-water oozing through the rock near its former opening made a useful supply  but the closing of the communication with the upper regions for which it had been originally devised was complete for ever .
`` How very cruel and unforgiving of those frogs , shutting up that only way out ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil , full of sympathy .
The Professor was puzzled at this mode of putting it .
He had to think over the remark for some time .
At last a light seemed to break on him .
`` Ah , I see , '' he said .
`` You mean the Croäxaxicans of that day were cruel in the course they took to punish their enemies by shutting our whole nation for ever out of their reach .
Well , perhaps - perhaps : but you must remember they had had great provocation .
And you see we have let you come in . ''
He went on to tell her how , after the Croäxaxicans had become thus exclusive , they perceived a serious difficulty in their new international policy : there was nobody for the heir to the throne to marry .
Of course none but the daughter of a reigning king could be his wife  and there was now no means of making a contract with any such princess .
For a time it looked as if the Royal Dynasty of Croäxaxica page : 116 must come to an end for want of wives and husbands for the Royal Sons and Daughters .
But the statesman genius of the inimitable Croäxaxicans was not to be baffled by any difficulty : Grachidichika was the expedient .
On the plot of ground in the back garden to which that name was given were erected a palace , a set of barracks , a parliament house , a flagstaff , and all that is necessary for a monarch 's capital .
The parliament house , indeed , was , by a mistake of the architect , a little too small , as it had barely room for the Speaker and one member , whereas there was to have been a Sergeant at Arms as well : but the palace was big enough for a large family , and the flagstaff was so tall that it would have been seen from outside the wall if there had not been made a hollow for it to stand in .
Thus this little domain , too small to have any live inhabitants except the Royal Family and their servants , the Speaker , and the Army , and therefore unable ever to threaten the independence of Croäxaxica , was able to rear a Royal race of marriageable persons .
By a solemn decree , it was called the Matrimonial Estate and Independent Kingdom of Grachidichika : and , to make certain , its Sovereign was not to be styled merely King , but King Regnant .
The title by which he was to be addressed was `` Your Matrimonial Majesty , '' and his children were to be `` Their Matrimonial Royal Highnesses . ''
There was some difficulty about getting a king , because of the confinement , to which all the Croäxaxicans with Royal Blood in their veins to whom the appointment could be offered objected : but at last the privy council hit on a capital plan .
page : 117 The Croäxaxicans had taken a prisoner during the war and , unwilling to part with so honourable a memorial , they had brought him with them .
It fortunately proved that he had begun life as a foundling and nobody could tell what his ancestors might not have been  it was , therefore , quite in order to pass an edict making them direct descendants of the first king of their country , whatever it might have been , and , that having been settled , the prisoner was , in right of his Royal Descent , naturally the proper person to succeed to the vacant crown of Grachidichika .
A Royal Princess was given him in marriage  and , as fast as his daughters and sons were born , they were betrothed to sons and daughters of the reigning King of Croäxaxica .
From that time the children of the Sovereigns were always married to each other as far as they would go .
`` And what is done if there are any left over ? ''
inquired Daffodil .
`` In the case of their Matrimonial Royal Highnesses , the Grachidichikan Princesses and Princes , '' replied the Professor , `` if there are any more of them than sons and daughters of a King of Croäxaxica can marry , they have simply failed to accomplish their destiny and they are accordingly deposed from their exalted position and cease to be members of their family .
As impostors and vagabonds without recognised means of subsistence , they are imprisoned for life in a workhouse specially built for them , where , however , they are provided with such simple requisites of food and clothing as become their humble sphere .
With the Royal Scions of Croäxaxica , the position is , of course , quite dissimilar  and , there - page : 118 fore , it has been decreed that , in the event of the Matrimonial Royalty not providing spouses in sufficient number , younger children of Croäxaxica may marry near descendants of former kings , and , even , in extreme scarcity , that two high officials should be eligible for their hands .
One is the Prime Minister , the oth - '' `` Prime Minister ! ''
broke in .
Daffodil , in surprise .
`` This is the first I have heard of him . ''
The Professor was trembling from head to foot .
`` How could I let such an expression slip from my tongue ! ''
he gasped , throwing his arms up into the air .
`` But where is he ? ''
asked Daffodil .
`` In the State Boa Constrictor , '' replied the Professor , solemnly .
Daffodil looked shocked and sorry .
`` What was his crime ? ''
she whispered .
`` He conspired to make his appointment quarterly instead of weekly , '' said the Professor in the same subdued tone .
`` But hush !
hush !
To name him is Treason .
One of my official duties is to go through the histories of our country and strike out every reference to any holder of that office . ''
`` That must make the histories a little confused , '' said Daffodil .
`` But , to be sure , the Prime Ministers always seem rather confused as it is , and the histories will be much more amusing without them . ''
She had to swear secrecy : the Professor was dreadfully uneasy lest his having spoken of the swallowed Prime Minister should be known and suspicions against his loyalty aroused .
And , for weeks after , he never let a day pass without con - page : 119 triving to meet Daffodil at least once and murmur to her `` You will be sure not to tell that I said Prime Minister . ''
This made her take a dislike to political discussions , and , consequently , she learned less of the Croäxaxican constitution and system of government than an intelligent traveller should have done .
But to return to the Crown Prince 's wedding .
As the viands used by the Croäxaxicans , and the flower garments they wear , are of a nature making a delicate freshness desirable , the preparation of the banquet and the festival attire were only begun on the very morning .
At daybreak thousands of cooks , thousands of dresspickers , thousands of odd hands to get in the way and help , set to work .
Soon , while the stir in the Royal Larder-beds and Kitchens grew wilder , and the Royal Dining-room was in an uproar with waiters telling each other where to put the dishes , the whole Plenipotentiary Department was undoing the blunders of exactly one million of hired hands , and shrieking with rapture at the magnificent costumes that , as fast as they were completed , were carried to pass in review order before the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
There was no delay to plan anything , either dish or dress , for every item of every sort was unalterably fixed by a law which gave the details of the wedding of the first Crown Prince who married after the Croäxaxicans had banished the frogs above ground by forming their present kingdom .
And , of course , all the provisions for the prescribed dishes had been collected and were swimming , or growing , ready for the moment 's turn , and the flowers had page : 120 been reared to size and shape and chosen and marked for picking .
Otherwise , in a hurry , some innovation might have occurred and the results would have been serious to the Croäxaxican Constitution .
Yet , in spite of all the forethought that had been exercised , it was discovered on the wedding morning that there were two serious difficulties .
One was Her Matrimonial Royal Highness 's bridal dress  the other was Daffodil .
The jealously treasured Royal Wedding Water-lily , the wearing of which by the bride is so vital a part of the Royal Marriage Ceremony , is the largest flower grown in Croäxaxica .
Her Matrimonial Royal Highness was the smallest frog that had been born in the country for fifty generations .
It had therefore been an anxious task to bring a dress to perfection and yet keep it sufficiently undersized to do for her .
Only one of the plants treated for the purpose had developed a flower in the required proportions  it had not been possible to carry out the usual custom of growing three dresses for the Queen 's selection for the bride .
And , lo , when the hour for the solemn gathering had come and the Queen took hold of the lily , it had become dangerously full-blown in the night , and three petals dropped off .
What could be done ?
Three petals from among the smallest of another lily might be tacked on with almost invisible fish-bones , but it was to be expected that other petals would drop if the dress were worn , and could the Princess go in procession in that tattered condition ?
And perhaps all the petals would drop off and leave her in no dress at all , and then the marriage would page : 121 be illegal .
It was proposed to put off the event till another lily or two of a suitable size could be reared , but the Crown Prince declared he would not wait so many months for the chance of their blooming to fit  and the ambassador of Grachidichika shook his head diplomatically and said , if Her Matrimonial Royal Highness was to be sent home unmarried , it would be his duty to protect the dignity of Grachidichika by withdrawing indignantly - which , being an arrangement not contemplated in any former time , would have been very inconvenient , for there was no room in Grachidichika for the ambassador , who naturally was expected to live in the country to which he was ambassador , and where , besides , he was hereditary Lord Mayor of his native street .
There was nothing for it but to put the poor little Princess into a lily of the usual size - in which she ran the risk of being smothered , as it would keep getting up over her face , and which was always twisting round her feet and tumbling her down .
As to Daffodil , on her account the marriage came again near postponement .
Only a little before the wedding procession was to start , the Crown Prince chanced to ask what her place in it was to be .
He was told that , there never having been such a person at a Royal Wedding before , the Master of the Ceremonies had not been able to find any rule for what to do with her , so she had had to be left out .
`` Let her carry my Princess 's pocket-handkerchief , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` The precedence due to it will mark her place . ''
It was pointed out to him that her office only connected her with page : 122 third best pocket-handkerchiefs and that to carry out this proposal would give rise to report against the new Crown Princess 's wedding pocket-handkerchief .
`` Then let her accompany one of the Queen 's third best pocket-handkerchiefs , '' said the Crown Prince .
But that could not be , for a third best pocket-handkerchief , even though a Royal one , was considered not greatly more worthy to appear on such an occasion than Daffodil herself .
Moreover the Master of the Ceremonies , and at last the Queen herself and all the Royal Family - except the King , who only shut his eyes venerably , and Prince Brekekex , who took his brother 's part - urged him to consider the impropriety of giving a mere joke like Daffodil a place in a procession in which many serious Court officials and servants and a whole host of Nobility longed in vain for admission .
But the Crown Prince could be obstinate when he chose .
`` The creature is a pet of mine , '' he said , `` and that is high standing enough .
She shall carry my pocket-handkerchief : that is , naturally , a third best one compared with what the Royal Ladies will use , so that being assigned to it will be in accordance with her proper service . ''
And , as the Queen still refused to consent to Daffodil 's taking part in so distinguished a procession , he absolutely refused to be married at all .
The ambassador of Grachidichika was sent for .
He began shaking his head  but , before he had finished and got ready to speak  the Queen exclaimed `` Say no more , my dear ambassador .
You have prevailed .
For the sake of continuing confidence between your Royal and Matrimonial master and our inimitably Royal Selves , I yield to page : 123 your entreaties .
Let My Majesty 's Royal Jester attend the Crown Prince 's wedding pocket-handkerchief . ''
And thus it came about that Daffodil surprised the Croäxaxicans by her appearance in the wedding train of the future King of Croäxaxica .
page : 124 CHAPTER X .
THE festivities in honour of the Crown Prince 's wedding did not end with the wedding-day - nor , indeed , did the wedding itself .
An ordinary Croäxaxican can be married in one day , a Nobleman in three , but it takes nine days for a Royal Prince .
Every morning the procession set forth , but with the bride in crimson and purple robes instead of in the water-lily sacred to the first occasion , and every day there were marriage ceremonies , which , however , became shorter each time till the last solemnity only took five minutes .
In the evenings there were balls and concerts and State Evening Parties , at which the Croäxaxican aristocracy outvied each other in splendour and novelty .
And these went on for six weeks .
And now a peculiar manifestation took place in the dress and bearing of the Croäxaxican young ladies of distinction .
Daffodil 's unlikeness to those around her had made her a prominent figure in the procession  surprise at the honour conferred on her , too , had made her the theme of much conversation , and wherever she went attention was attracted to her .
By degrees gentlemen of credit for cultivated page : 125 taste got to saying that they could detect a sort of savage charm in her hideousness , and the ladies took to thinking whether there was not something romantic in looking so odd .
And when rumours went about that the Crown Prince had said she was delightfully ridiculous , and when Prince Brekekex had called her in a couplet `` Loathsome sweet , renown ` dly queer , A quaint , abnormal , frightful , dear , '' there was a sudden conviction that to be picturesque and original a froggess must imitate Daffodil .
Headpieces of dried-up rushes or grasses were invented to represent hair  throats were stretched up and dresses cut with a deep curve to suggest the effect of a neck  gestures and gait were copied - so far that is as possibilities and the limits of grace and decorum allowed - and the more enterprising of the Croäxaxican beauties even adopted Daffodil 's costume of the untrimmed tunic with the eccentricity of the girding in at the waist .
The froggesses were , of course , far from wishing to acquire a real resemblance to their model : they felt that the piquancy of their imitation lay very much in the fact that they never could be like her enough not to remind everybody who saw them that they were decidedly different and had all the perfections of froggesses .
A few froggesses , exaggerating the fashion , as foolish people sometimes will , took to pinching in their mouths in order to reduce them a little nearer to the size of hers , but even they would have greatly resented being mistaken for her .
As to Daffodil , some annoyance mingled at first with her surprise at beholding bevies of distant likenesses of herself .
She was not without vanity , and page : 126 though she behaved herself respectfully to her hosts , she cherished in her secret mind a notion that human beings were , after all , of a higher order than other people and that the differences between her and these foreigners were points in her favour .
Therefore she felt almost as if the froggesses were taking a liberty in adopting her appearance , and she could not for a while get rid of a sensation that the copies of her were unflattering .
And , when she got used to the prevailing fashion , it was mortifying to perceive that the more a froggess contrived to look like her the more absurd the froggess looked , and the plainer .
`` I never quite believed it before , when you all said I was so ugly , '' she remarked despondingly to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , who always admitted her freely to her presence : `` I thought it was only because you did not understand our faces : but now I begin to think I must have grown different from what I was at home , without noticing it .
I must really be something strange , for everybody that grows at all like me loses every bit of good looks and turns into a figure of fun .
I must be getting dreadful . ''
`` On the contrary , '' replied the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary encouragingly : `` You are growing much more like us . ''
`` Oh ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil .
`` What is it ? ''
said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , in kindly anxiety .
`` Have you hurt yourself ? ''
`` No  Pre-eminent Madam  it was - it was something that startled me , '' said Daffodil , turning very red at nearly having had the rudeness to show her Pre-eminence that she did not think it nice to be like a page : 127 Croäxaxican .
`` But do you think it is really that I am growing like frogs ?
Do n't you think perhaps it is that there is so much dressing up on my pattern ? ''
`` It may be so , indeed , '' said the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
`` Yes , it may be so .
You are modest .
And you are wise not to overrate the improvement in yourself .
But this fashion must not make a lasting stamp on Croäxaxican costume .
I have indulged it - nay encouraged and guided it - but I can not allow this cultivation of ugliness to be permanent .
The imitation is getting near its climax : for a while after it has reached the climax I shall rest in calm  but then , suddenly , when all eyes have grown accustomed to monstrosity and will feel its absence a shock , I shall burst upon them with a contrast - a return to the boldest and broadest frog type .
The prerogative of genius is to metamorphose .
In a year 's time not a froggess at Court but shall be squashing her head flat and stretching her mouth and trying to look as if she had a tadpole tail growing on her : I have designed some very good artificial tails in my brain already .
When the reaction comes it will be easier to see how far your development has gone .
But I do think you are growing less peculiar . ''
`` Your Pre-eminence is more used to my looks , '' said Daffodil .
`` Do n't you think it may be that ? ''
she added rather anxiously .
Her Pre-eminence smiled .
`` There is a sort of sight , '' she said , `` that never gets used to anything .
It sees everything differently each time it looks , and can never be mistaken .
That sight is the sight of page : 128 genius .
I am lowly , little-lettered , merely spontaneous  were it not for the enthusiasm of a partial world I might be obscure  yet I have somewhat of that sight .
You may trust my judgment , for I am destitute of the faculty : I have only inspiration .
And my judgment tells me that , although you can never hope to pass for a native Croäxaxican , you are beginning to be about to cease to look unnatural . ''
After that Daffodil used to look at herself very often in the clear shallow looking-pools with black floors , and with bright waters placed to throw the right light on them , which abound in the houses of the Croäxaxicans - who are very fond of enjoying the sight of themselves .
But , with all her examination , she could not detect any signs of her growing more like a frog than she was before she came to Croäxaxica .
In some things , however , she now possessed a considerable resemblance to those among whom she was living : and of that she was very glad .
She had acquired their accomplishments - not to perfection , indeed , but still enough to share their higher pleasures and to take part in them creditably .
She could join advantageously in a chorus  she could play on the splash-splash - an instrument made of a huge bowl full of water , performed on by means of slaps on the water with a seed-bladder in size and appearance something like an ostrich egg a little magnified  and she could even blow the croak-tube - but it was better she should do that singly , as she was rather variable in her execution , and that caused surprises to other players in a concerted piece .
It page : 129 takes most people the best hours of ten years to attain so much musical proficiency , and Daffodil 's rapid arrival at it was a source of wonder and amusement to her protectors .
She could act in hoppades - a kind of silent dramatic representation in a peculiar measured quick step , in which fashionable Croäxaxicans are fond of displaying their vivacity of mind : and , although her appearance confined her to inferior comic parts , the accurate manner in which she remembered what she ought to do often caused regret in hoppade managers ' minds that her faculty could not be transferred to some beautiful froggess who might play heroine .
But , while the speed with which she shot up to her competence in these higher arts startled the Croäxaxicans , her clumsiness in acquiring the matter-of-course art of swimming confirmed them in their opinion of her possessing an inferior intelligence to that which gave their race its supremacy .
Her flounderings and her sinkings , her feeble successes in accomplishing two or three strokes , her relapses into failure , her jerking action and kicking up of her feet , seemed to reveal an impassable gulf between them and her - the difference between the frog and the oyster , between reason and instinct .
`` It will never swim , '' they said .
`` Nature has put that outside its comprehension . ''
But she did learn to swim , getting quite self-possessed in the exercise by her twelfth lesson , and , by frequent practice , she became expert enough to beat the Head Royal Physician , who was a very deliberate frog , in a race .
She got on much more quickly with dancing  but , then , she never reached anything like so nearly page : 130 to the Croäxaxican ideal as she managed to do in swimming .
The Queen amused herself by teaching her .
Daffodil easily mastered the Slow-and-Low hops and the Short Jumps and the Strides  and Her Majesty began with these in her lessons , as is the usual course of instruction .
But , when it came to the High-and-Fly Hops and the Long Jumps and the Bounds-Rebounded and , almost more impossible , the various Dozen-in-an-Inch steps , she made such desperate efforts all to no purpose , and had so many slips and tumbles , that the Queen would laugh herself dumb from hoarseness .
Nevertheless , one or two persons who were allowed to see the lessons , and especially the Crown Prince and Prince Brekekex and the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , said there was an individuality in Daffodil 's dancing , in the steps in which she did not tumble down , that did the Queen great credit .
And the Queen herself did not disdain to practise a glide her pupil employed for getting over distances she could not bound , and to display her rendering of it at a Sociable Evening .
The movement was much admired for its novelty , and became celebrated under the name of the Royal Raucacöaxine Slipping Step , after the name of the Majestic inventress .
That Sociable Evening had another noticeable feature besides Her Majesty 's new step .
There were present a big gentleman and a little lady who sat one on each side of the Queen and who were , from time to time , addressed by her , in a very loud voice , as Duke and Duchess Unknown .
And all the high Court dignitaries who had the right of being greeted by Her Majesty and the Royal Family turned after - wards to this pair and shouted with much solemnity `` How do you do , Duke Unknown ?
Good evening , Duchess Unknown . ''
And Prince Brekekex sang , accompanying himself on the splash-splash , a song at which he had been busy with Daffodil most of that week - for he had composed both the words and the music : `` Hail to the strangers , guests in our land , Where is their own we ca n't understand : He 's Duke Unknown , his Duchess is she , And now we 're as wise as 't is needful to be . ''
At the moment that the lotus buds of the great clock in the ceiling opened for twelve o'clock , the gentleman and lady rose and bowed to the Queen .
She gave them her hand to kiss , and said politely `` Good-bye , my dear Duke and Duchess Unknown .
I do not expect ever to see you again .
I wish you a pleasant journey . ''
On this they withdrew , and the Queen remarked `` Let us resume our conversation , '' but , after a few minutes ' pause , back came the big gentleman and the little lady , with coronets and mantles on , and the Queen jumped up and kissed them and called out `` What !
my dear Crown Prince and Crown Princess !
Just arrived from Grachidichika !
How lucky it is you are in time for our Sociable Evening . ''
And the Royal Family and the Court dignitaries welcomed the Crown Prince and Princess just returned from Grachidichika .
And the company , rising and bowing and curtseying , with the Regius Professor of Everything for spokesman , took the liberty of entreating that the Princesses would sing the national song in felicitation of this auspicious event .
page : 132 It is a matter of indispensable form that , at the end of the six weeks of the marriage festivities , the Royal Bride and Bridegroom - unless it is the Sovereign of Croäxaxica himself who is the bridegroom - shall set out in state for Grachidichika , there to perform a honeymoon of nine weeks ' duration .
But sometimes , when the Royal Matrimonial Family had been numerous , there had not been accommodation for a visitor to the kingdom and it had had to be connived at that the newly-married pair , after a grand public reception , should slip out of Grachidichika by the back gate and return to Croäxaxica to live there in a sort of secrecy .
As the Croäxaxican Princes and Princesses very much disapproved of being cooped up in Grachidichika , this exceptional manner of staying there gradually became the rule , and the Royal Princely Bridal Pairs always returned to Croäxaxica immediately after their reception at the court of Grachidichika , concealing their identity by assumed names .
The Crown Prince 's nine weeks ' honeymoon had expired the night before the Queen 's Sociable Evening  twenty-four hours were counted for the journey from Grachidichika for , although that country was in the back garden not ten minutes ' walk from the room where the Sociable Evening was held , it would not have been deferential to it to treat a journey from it as a trifling matter : and thus it was that the departure of the Duke and Duchess Unknown and the return of the Prince and Princess took place at midnight in the course of a Sociable Evening .
It was now necessary that there should be a series of festivities in honour of this return .
The page : 133 entertainments were less ceremonious , but not less brilliant , than those belonging to the wedding period .
And they were more varied .
Hoppades and swimming tournaments were in favour , and there were picnics and reviews and garden parties and public state promenades .
One day there was a great gathering of all the Royal Household Officers and Servants in the Queen 's Royal Private Garden , and they were all allowed to wind round the dais on which the Royal Family were seated , so that each of them might see the bride .
It took a good many hours , although everybody , as directed , bounded by at a flying pace - so many hours that there had to be a great temporary structure with sleeping rooms and a refreshment room for the members of the Royal Family to go to when they chose .
And the Crown Princess would spend most of the day there , eating all sorts of things which had been too expensive to have at home in her father 's palace  but , whenever she was not in her place on the dais , her coronet and mantle were put on her chair to represent her and prevent disappointment .
After the filing round was over , the Queen made some promotions , and presented decorations in her own name and the King 's , and the Crown Prince presented decorations in the name of his father-in-law .
There had been a great deal of promoting and giving orders at the time of the marriage , but that was for the Great Nobility and the holders of high offices in the kingdom : the titles and the badges now were of the kind called Merit and Civility Distinctions , and they were conferred on superintending officials and specially approved subordinates in the departments in the personal service page : 134 of Royalty .
The Head Royal Dressmaker received an order of the first grade - she had the second grade already  the Head Royal Dresspicker and the Head Secretary Spinster received the order of the second grade  the Second Secretary Spinster got the order of the third grade  and badges of honour , of importance proportioned to each recipient 's position or favour , were allotted to other members of the Plenipotentiary Department .
Then suitable distinctions were bestowed among the chiefs of the strictly household bodies - among which the Royal Cookery Service , of course , held a special rank and precedence .
The Queen 's arm began to ache long before the decoration giving was done , and the Crown Prince got tired too  so they went away .
But Prince Brekekex and the Princesses , his sisters , went on with it for them  and the Princesses , who did not often get a chance of taking the chief parts in public , did their work slowly to make it last longer , and looked , for their ages , quite like Queens .
Daffodil was highly pleased at the shower of honours that had fallen on the department in which she was enrolled , and felt happy in witnessing the pride and delight of the fortunate ones as they pranced about imposingly , wearing their decorations .
She little thought that she herself had been very near to receiving the recognition of a badge .
All the Royal Family wished it - including the Crown Princess , who had taken a great liking to her , running to her whenever she saw her - the Queen herself had been the first to think of it  and it was with regret that they all came to the conclusion that the Lord Chamberlain was right in pointing out page : 135 that there would be a want of reverence to those honours from Royalty in conferring them on one in her comparatively humble position , unless on the ground of some exceptional and remarkable act of signal merit .
`` To have made me wish her to have it is signal merit , '' the Queen had replied when the Lord Chamberlain made this suggestion : but , on thinking it over by herself , she decided that she did not care quite enough about Daffodil 's having a badge for the merit to be signal on this occasion .
Accordingly the badge in question was given Seventy Seven And A Half in mistake for Seven And A Half , who had been recommended for devotion in sitting forty-eight hours holding the water-lily bud for the bride 's dress , so that it might not open too soon , and going without food all the time in order that her hands might be cold enough to chill it and keep it back .
Another day there was a `` Popular Demonstration '' in the great gardens of the palace .
Everybody , of whatever rank , was admitted , providing he or she carried a flag .
A space was railed off for the Royal Family and those with them to promenade in , and all the people waved their flags over their heads till the whole place looked like a kaleidoscope in a hurry .
But what delighted Daffodil more than any other of the grand shows and entertainments was the Water-work Display : she had never seen anything so dazzling and so fantastic as that .
At one moment there were thousands of jets of every hue flashing and mingling in the air  at another a single stream of transparent gold or silver or of some beautiful tint would glide and widen high overhead page : 136 till the whole vault glowed with light , and then , sometimes gathering together again , sometimes separating into many , would descend at last in a thousand snaky coils , or in a radiant sea of foam .
Then again a soft cloud of spray would spread over everything , and in the middle of it a fountain would spring up and flash its coloured light , which the spray reflected in softened tones and mingled with rainbows  then the fountain would die down , and another of a different colour would rise suddenly in its place .
A simpler sort of water-works was used frequently between the grander spectacles - these were networks and scrolls and intricate patterns traced , now on the ground , now on the ceiling , by numbers of thread-like rills .
Once the expanse of the vault overhead , almost as far as could be seen , was studded with tiny pools : `` Oh !
it is like great stars in the sky ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil .
But no one could tell what she meant , for there is no sky in Croäxaxica : all is roofed in .
They have let the word sky slip out of their language , and they do not know any stars except two triangle-shaped leaves fastened across each other .
page : 137 CHAPTER XI .
AMID all these splendours and gaieties there was one person mournful .
It was the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
A great mortification had come upon her , and she would have liked , had it been possible , to flee from Croäxaxica to some remote enchanted world where genius and dressmaking were unknown and she could be a contented nobody among contented nobodies .
No great exercise of her gifts had been possible during the wedding and the entertainments belonging to it .
For the wedding itself , every costume in its turn , and every fringe or loop of every costume , was settled by immutable rule  and , the dresses to be worn by the Royal Family and their Lords and Ladies in Waiting and the great officers of state at the balls and banquets and concerts in honour of the Wedding , being also prescribed , it would have been improper for the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to introduce any creation of importance at such a season .
But the period of rejoicings after the honeymoon was especially the time for new fashions , caprices , startling effects .
It was the time , then , for her to arise and eclipse all former triumphs of the page : 138 art of dress with a new masterpiece .
The Court , the world , looked to her for this - and she could not do it !
Invention failed her : nothing would come .
No one suspected what was amiss : people saw her lost in reverie and they supposed she was working out great designs in her mind  they found her moody and cross and they felt sure she was wearing herself out by carrying on too many inspirations at once .
When she once or twice said petulantly `` I have thought of nothing - absolutely nothing , '' they only smiled and expected some great thing all the more .
All this confidence in her , and all this applauding expectation , distressed her worse , and seemed too to make it still more impossible for her to command her genius and devise anything .
She withdrew for days to her isolated studio-house : nothing came of her communings with solitude but trifles , or variations on well-known past or present modes , She came back again to mingle with the gadding throng and excite her mind by the pomp and stir and hurry of the giddy hour  but she was left weary and emotionless , less than ever able to strike out a great idea .
This was a sorrow she could not trust to closest friend or faithfullest servant .
But no one had ever thought it worth while to keep up appearances to Daffodil , who , on her part , made the incaution harmless by never talking about what she saw were private matters - and now the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary found a solace in pouring her laments into the simple ears of her favourite .
`` This , '' she said , `` is the curse of genius , not to be able to find itself when it wants itself .
Look at me !
What a fate !
page : 139 The power is in me - I know !
I feel it !
- but it wo n't come out .
It has never come out .
All my life I have felt the lack of strange occasions , magnificent needs - those calls to genius from without : they never came till now , and now there is something wrong somehow and I feel as if it had been somebody else that had my genius all ready to be called . ''
`` Never mind it now , it will be just as you want it at some other opportunity , '' said Daffodil sympathisingly .
`` Another opportunity ! ''
repeated the Plenipotentiary , sadly , `` Can I hope for one like this ?
No , I never had an opportunity before for exerting my full power  I never shall have one again . ''
And she wrung her hands and sobbed piteously .
`` Oh , '' she exclaimed through her tears , `` What can be done ?
One high-day after another passed with all its clothes , and my idea not produced ! ''
`` I really do n't think it matters so very much , '' Daffodil put in , in a consolatory tone , `` they all seem to be enjoying themselves nicely in the sort of clothes they had before . ''
`` Ah ! ''
said the Plenipotentiary bitterly , `` Yes , they are enjoying themselves .
It is ever thus .
Genius pines , and toils , and bleeds , apart , and a ruthless world waits not for the treasures it would give it , but goes on never missing them and - enjoys itself ! ''
`` I am sure they would be sorry , if they knew how vexed you are , '' said Daffodil .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary laughed hysterically , `` They shall not know , '' she said .
`` Let me page : 140 wear the reveller 's mask of smiles as hitherto , and be one among them .
Only a simple creature like you shall know how I am all the while toiling and suffering and spending myself for them . ''
`` But , dear Pre-eminent Madam , why should you go on doing anything of the kind ? ''
urged Daffodil .
`` If they do n't want the things , why should you put yourself to so much inconvenience to let them have them ? ''
`` Why !
Can you ask why ?
Think of the loss to the Universe if it is robbed of my idea !
Understand , if your faculties permit you : I am nothing - a mere ordinary mortal , with perhaps rather an extra share of intelligence - but I am the responsible distributor of my genius .
I may not keep for myself , hidden in unknown depths , some priceless jewel which should be a nation 's joy . ''
But more high-days went by and still Croässaquagha had not been able to get the jewel out of the unknown depths .
People began to wonder what could be the cause of her inaction , and the Queen , who had been surprisingly patient , was heard to remark that the treason of a Prime Minister had been wanting to do too much , but that the first signs of disaffection in a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary might possibly be doing too little .
The great event of all was now near at hand - an evening State Reception called `` The Soirée of Honour '' - and the unhappy Plenipotentiary begged permission to withdraw once more to the seclusion of her private retreat to complete the bringing out of her great idea .
The Queen became in a good humour with her again on hearing of a great idea , but she remarked that she hoped page : 141 that she would also bring out a good many middling-sized and small ideas in her intervals of leisure from the great one .
Alas !
No idea of any size at all to speak of would let itself be brought out any more than before .
The Plenipotentiary sat all day long , and often all night long too , lost in despondency .
`` Oh !
why , why , was I born different from other people ? ''
she would exclaim when Daffodil came to see how she was getting on , `` Why was I not made to enjoy this simple happy life of doing nothing at all ?
Why was I given this fatal gift of genius ?
And , since I was given it , why wo n't it be in working order when it 's wanted ? ''
`` It does seem a pity , '' was all Daffodil could reply .
She did her best to console and encourage her patroness , and was constant in her visits , but she could find no useful service to render in such a calamity as this .
Daffodil , meanwhile , had a perplexity of her own , which , though of a trivial nature , threatened to be more than embarrassing .
She had been as tall as the tallest frog in Croäxaxica when she arrived , and she was growing  consequently she needed for her tunics the longest bell flowers in ordinary cultivation , - to say the least of it .
She had now a small wardrobe compartment of her own assigned to her , and the Plenipotentiary had given orders that care should be taken to keep it supplied with flowers of extra growth  but the pressure upon all the servants of the department in this stirring time caused a neglect of minor duties like this , and , as the great demand made the finest flowers less plentiful , those trans - page : 142 planted into her wardrobe , taken , as they were , haphazard from what the dresspickers did not claim for higher use , were puny things , ill adapted to her stature .
And , moreover , less and less pains being bestowed on the general cultivation of the shelves in the Royal Wardrobe establishment as the amount of attention required to keep up a sufficient stock of the choicest specimens increased , the flowers not marked for special cultivation were being so ill looked after that they began what , if their cultivation had not been energetically resumed a little later , would have been a return to the size of their original kindred , from which many hundred years of skilful rearing had brought them .
Thus , while Daffodil was growing longer fast , her tunics were growing shorter faster .
The dwindling became such as to cause her grave apprehensions : several times she had been on the point of laying the matter before the Plenipotentiary , but it seemed too great an intrusion while she had so much on her mind .
But one day - the day that was to culminate in the `` Soirée of Honour '' - when she got up in the morning and went to her wardrobe for a dress , there were but two tunic flowers blown - two bright blue campanulas , one dark and the other forget-me-not colour - and these two were alarmingly small .
`` They look as if they had been grown for the Crown Princess , '' said she to herself .
`` And only two for all to-day , when there are four different sorts of festivals to dress for , besides the Soirée , where I am to hold the Crown Prince 's pocket-handkerchief again .
Well , I ca n't help it : I must make the dark one do for everything all day , and the light one must be page : 143 kept for the Soirée . ''
But , when she had put on the dark flower , she found she could not possibly let herself be seen in it : it did not reach quite to her knees .
She took it off and tossed it away in a pet .
`` It is too provoking !
Now I must take the light one , and I shall have to wear it all limp and fading at the Soirée , and with tatters in it too very likely , after all it will go through in the day . ''
And she put on the light flower .
But , no  she could not go about in that either  it was but little longer than the other .
Now this really was extremely awkward .
For she could not go about to try and obtain another dress , cutting the figure she would in either of these short-skirted garments  she must remain where she was till somebody came to look for her .
And , as there was so much going on that day , she might not be missed till the time for holding the Crown Prince 's pocket-handkerchief had come .
Nay , very likely she might not be looked for even then .
And there was not a single bud to blow next day .
`` Anyhow , I suppose somebody will come before I am starved to death , '' she said resignedly , and sat down in her light blue kilt to wait .
But presently she thought of a better way than that .
`` They will nearly crack themselves with laughing at my queer costume , '' said she  `` but being laughed at is less disagreeable than staying here wondering if any one will come to help me . ''
And she picked up the dark campanula from where she had thrown it , took off the one she had on , and set to work .
With a sharp dressmaking knife of fishbone she cut off the upper half of the shorter cam - page : 144 panula , leaving a sort of deep flounce which she proceeded to stitch round the bottom of the other flower .
In doing this , as she had no experience in cutting , she got her dress longer than she intended , and , moreover , at the back , from an accidental unevenness in the piece she had stitched on , it drooped in a train .
Croäxaxican needlework can not be unpicked - there is no taking out the stitches or needles , as they are called indifferently , without making rents in the flower material - so she could not alter what she had done , she would only have made even that dress unwearable .
But it did not matter very seriously  her intention was to go at once to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary by the private ways , where she would perhaps meet no one at all , and to beg her to have her provided with a long length tunic .
The few people who saw Daffodil pass out - servants at work - scarcely looked at her , and thought she was carrying a bundle , for she had thrown her train over her arm .
Putting her train out of her way in this manner shortened the front of her skirt , too , or else she would not so easily have escaped attracting attention .
She hurried as fast as she could , for she did not like the notion of becoming a laughing-stock .
It was not pleasant to have to appear thus before her Pre-eminence  but from her there would be no rough jeers , and , if she did have a good laugh at the spectacle , Daffodil felt that it would be so satisfactory to see her roused out of her despondency that she should scarcely mind it .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was alone .
Daffodil , who was allowed unceremonious access page : 145 like a child or a pet oyster , found her seated in a dejected attitude , gazing dreamily at a plot of marigolds .
She said in a weary tone `` One could put frills of these on an iris-petal mantle .
But what is there new in frills ? ''
`` Well , no  they 're not very new , '' said Daffodil .
`` Most people have got them , I 'm afraid . ''
`` Everybody , '' sighed the Plenipotentiary , continuing to gaze at the marigolds .
`` I shall be actually glad if she laughs at me , '' thought Daffodil  `` she does want rousing . ''
Presently , finding the Plenipotentiary did not look up , she said `` Please look at me , Pre-eminent Madam .
Just see what an object I am . ''
She was standing with her train spread out on the ground , and the points of her light blue upper skirt had all curled up , because of the stitches in them , and stood in a bristling sort of way above the dark skirt joined on .
The Plenipotentiary looked at her .
She seemed struck dumb .
So amazed a face Daffodil had never seen in her life  `` I know I look rather strange , '' she said deprecatingly .
The Plenipotentiary replied `` Hail , mighty artist , let me kiss thy feet . ''
It was Daffodil 's turn to be surprised now , for the Plenipotentiary had evidently made her remarkable observation in a serious spirit .
For a moment she feared that Her Pre-eminence must be going mad  but she remembered that madness is unknown in Croäxaxica .
She waited for explanation  and the Plenipotentiary sat and stared at her .
`` Is it possible ? ''
murmured the Plenipotentiary .
`` Has this simple , half-savage creature been inspired page : 146 with the immortal idea I have failed to reach ? ''
Then , rising , and approaching Daffodil , she said solemnly , `` Tell me on your highest faith , oh , Her Majesty 's Royal Private Jester , was this conception yours ?
- yours alone ? ''
`` I thought by myself of stitching one tunic on to another , because each of them was much too short separate , '' answered Daffodil .
`` Come to the Queen , '' said the Plenipotentiary , and , taking her by the hand , she led her off in breathless haste , without a word more all the way .
The Queen was paying a visit to the youngest Royal Princesses in their nursery .
When she was told that her Pre-eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary desired an interview and appeared in urgent haste , she felt sure it was about the great idea .
`` I hope nothing has gone wrong to prevent her giving it me for this evening , '' said she , and ordered that the Plenipotentiary should be shown into the Royal Nursery immediately .
In rushed the Plenipotentiary , without the least pause for ceremony , leading Daffodil .
`` Behold '' she said , and turned Daffodil slowly round and round for exhibition .
The Queen was so struck with what she beheld that she never thought of being indignant at her subject 's omission of the proper signs of respect .
`` My dear Plenipotentiary , '' she cried in enthusiasm , `` this is an idea ! ''
`` It is a revelation , '' replied the Plenipotentiary .
`` So much as that ? ''
said the Queen inquiringly .
`` Does not Your Majesty perceive the combinations that may be made upon this marvellous type ?
page : 147 How the dark tunic might be uppermost instead of the light ?
How the colours might be different altogether ?
There could be a frill round the upper tunic  or round the lower - or even round both !
Oh !
the vista for the future , of fancy upon fancy springing from this commencement , is infinite !
INFINITE !!! ''
And the Plenipotentiary broke into sobs of ecstasy .
`` Why does it go down over the ground that way at the back ? ''
asked the Queen .
`` It 's a train , Your Majesty , '' said Daffodil  `` but it was a mistake . ''
`` I do n't want a mistake , '' said the Queen .
`` Mistake ! ''
ejaculated the Plenipotentiary , clasping her hands , `` The inspired creature is unconscious or mocks us .
It is the crowning perfection .
It is beyond words .
Observe , Your Majesty , the dignity , the superb grace of the arrangement .
Oh !
you will look thrice yourself in this wondrous appendage . ''
`` Well , '' said the Queen , `` I will admit that your great idea has been worth your keeping me waiting for it all this while . ''
`` Royal Madam , '' the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary answered , in a voice thrilled with emotion , `` I have to tell you that , not I , but one with a mightier genius than mine , a genius such as the world has not known till now , has found the idea I was looking for .
Not mine this immortal creation  it is Daffodil 's ! ''
`` But what did she put it on for ? ''
said Her Majesty , who , during this speech , had been looking discontentedly at Daffodil .
`` It is very improper and impertinent that she should be wearing my page : 148 new style of dress first  even if she did invent it .
You have never done such a thing yourself . ''
The matter was explained , and the Queen , though still a little displeased , sent for the largest tunic procurable , for Daffodil to put on at once in exchange for the dress which was to be the model for that in which Her Majesty would enrapture her court that evening .
Her Majesty , moreover , expressed her approbation of what Daffodil had done in inventing so striking a dress , and promised that , if the effect of it were successful at the Soirée of Honour , she should have some high reward - perhaps even a merit distinction order of the first grade , her achievement being so extraordinary .
That evening , when Her Majesty waggled in her long skirt and train through a lane of her most distinguished subjects , the astonishment was so great that you could have heard a needle drop while people drew in their breaths .
Then , ascending the raised platform on which the thrones were prepared , instead of at once taking her seat beside the King , who , having entered separately with his suite , was already calmly reposing in his place , she walked up and down the platform two or three times and turned about , as she did so , that the train might be the better displayed .
The whole room was carried away by irrepressible enthusiasm , and burst into loud and long applause .
The King himself stared , and said `` Splendid ! ''
twice .
`` Thanks , my friends , '' said the Queen , when the transports had somewhat calmed and she had taken her seat , `` I accept your appreciation .
But there is one whom you must congratulate with me .
Let page : 149 her Pre-eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary advance . ''
The Plenipotentiary had , in right of her high office , a seat on the platform almost beside the youngest Royal Princess .
She came forward at the summons and knelt before the Queen .
`` Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , '' said the Queen , `` accept , as a mark of my approbation , this jewelled fillet .
It shall henceforth be , in addition to your jewelled star of office , the token of your exalted post . ''
And she fastened the fillet round the Plenipotentiary 's head .
The Plenipotentiary rose , and reverently made the hops of homage .
Then , before there was time for the Queen to give the assembly the smile which , under the circumstances , would have authorised them to express their feelings in murmurs of satisfaction , she said , in a loud slow voice that all might hear , `` Never , Your Majesty , can I forget your condescension of this evening , never can I forget this stupendous recognition of genius in my poor person .
From my heart I thank you  genius thanks you through my lowly voice . ''
She stopped , the Queen looked at the audience , and a buzz of applause greeted her words .
Then she resumed , - still more loud and distinct , `` And now I have a duty to perform - a duty to the world .
To me it shall owe the possession of its greatest artist , now left in inglorious obscurity to be lost to it .
My Sovereigns , my Princes , Croäxaxicans , not to me was the immense idea you beheld this evening vouchsafed , but - yes , hear it - to MY SUPERIOR . ''
Thereupon , springing to where Daffodil was kneeling page : 150 behind the Crown Prince 's chair , holding his pocket-handkerchief , she dragged her forward and knelt to her .
`` Oh , please , do n't , '' said Daffodil .
`` See , '' said the Plenipotentiary , rising  `` I have knelt to her .
Let it be told of me to future ages that I knew her and knelt to her . ''
`` It certainly is a remarkable proceeding , '' said the Queen , much puzzled .
The Plenipotentiary addressed Daffodil : `` Inspired imaginer , '' she said , `` teacher for all artists for ever , to thee I surrender my office .
Be to Croäxaxica what I have been - and More . ''
She took the fillet from her head and transferred it to Daffodil 's .
`` I would much rather not - '' began Daffodil .
But at that moment the King roused himself and , his glance falling on the Queen 's dress , he murmured `` The very thing ! ''
and everybody said `` Hush-sh-sh '' to Daffodil for interrupting his Majesty .
And , as it was understood that His Majesty expressed approbation of the arrangement proposed by the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , the matter was looked on as settled .
Not even the Queen would have contested a ratification so authoritatively given .
The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary led Daffodil to the Queen , pushed her on her knees , and , kneeling beside her , removed the fillet just placed on her own head , and laid it on the Queen 's lap .
`` Royal Madam , '' said she , `` I implore you , accepting my resignation of my post in favour of one greater than myself , to set the honoured token of office on her head with your own perfuming hands .
The star of office , which I can not get off without tearing my dress , she shall possess to-morrow . ''
page : 151 `` To be sure , '' said the Queen .
`` But it seems rather odd .
She is not a Croäxaxican . ''
`` All geniuses are our fellow-countrymen , '' replied the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
`` Whoever has genius is a Croäxaxican . ''
`` Well , '' said the Queen , `` it 's all right , I suppose .
Only I had quite made up my mind to give her the merit distinction order of the first grade on the very next opportunity  and I have no doubt she would have been quite contented . ''
And she began to put the fillet on Daffodil , but , stopping suddenly : `` Wait a moment , '' she said  `` things must be properly settled .
If she is Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , what will you be ? ''
`` Nothing , '' said the Plenipotentiary .
`` That will do very well , '' said the Queen .
`` But what title can you have ?
It will not be possible for a person who has been Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to be without a title . ''
`` Ex-Pre-eminence will suffice , '' was the reply .
`` Her Ex-Pre-eminence , the Nothing , '' mused the Queen .
`` That hardly seems enough .
Remember you have been the first person in our kingdom , next to the Royal Family : it is due to us that you should preserve fitting dignity .
No , you must be Her Grandeur the Private Under-Princess .
You deserve some reward for your services , and for all this trouble you have taken to get a better Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
Rise , Private Under-Princess and Her Grandeur . ''
The new Private Under-Princess rose , overcome with gratitude .
The Queen tied the fillet on Daffodil 's head and said `` We appoint you Dressmaker page : 152 Plenipotentiary of this realm , with all the authority and precedence of the office , the titles of Pre-eminence and Pre-eminent Madam , and the right of the jewelled fillet and the jewelled star , '' and Daffodil rose also .
The Under-Princess led her to the seat which had been her own , and pushed her into it - she had to push her , for Daffodil was reluctant to take so exalted a position , and , above all , to leave the Private Under-Princess without a seat , in consequence .
But the Private Under-Princess insisted on standing behind her chair , while the ceremonies of the evening progressed .
Every one , even the Royal Princes and Princesses had to be ceremonially presented to the King and Queen .
The new Private Under-Princess waited for her turn , which came next after Daffodil 's , and then quietly went out of the room , leaving Daffodil in her chair of state - the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica !
page : 153 CHAPTER XII .
WHEN Daffodil awoke next morning , she thought she had dreamed the events of the Soirée of Honour , so incredible did it seem that she should have become the chief personage , after Royalty , of the government of Croäxaxica .
But , looking round , she saw that she really was in the magnificent apartments assigned to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , in which she had been sleepily thinking that she must have dreamed that she had gone to bed .
`` I do n't think I shall like it at all , '' she thought  `` and I sha n't know how to behave .
But I can easily invent dresses for them , since they are so pleased with two things sewed together and a draggling bit at the back . ''
There came a splash at her door , and she called `` Come in . ''
`` Pre-eminent Madam , '' said the Head of the Upper Royal Wardrobe-maids , who had the privilege of calling the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary every morning and receiving her first orders for the day , `` the Head Royal Dresspicker and the Head Royal Dressmaker request audiences of Your Pre-eminence before you rise , as Your Pre-eminence did not give them orders last night for the first morning dresses of the page : 154 Royal Ladies , nor for your own .
The Head Royal Lady 's - maid is in attendance with her staff to know if you have instructions to give before she goes with them to the Royal Apartments .
The Head Secretary Spinster requests your commands as to the hour at which she shall wait on you to submit for your corrections the lists and descriptions of the dresses of the Royal Family and the Court at yesterday 's entertainments . ''
`` Oh dear !
Can I possibly do all that ? ''
sighed Daffodil .
She managed pretty well , however .
Great part of the business , she found , was mere matter of form , for the persons to whom she had to give orders had been in the habit of suggesting to her predecessor what she should desire them to do , and much which seemed to require express arrangement for the day was really a matter of routine .
For instance the Head Royal Dresspicker helped her out with `` Your Pre-eminence will perhaps wish foxgloves used this morning - it is the second Thursday of the month , '' and the Head Royal Dressmaker with `` I presume I shall be carrying out Pre-eminent Madam 's wishes by making the pouch-sleeve the fashion for the day - it 's the twentieth in turn . ''
The Royal Lady 's - maids she dismissed to their duties with the complimentary remark that she was sure they thoroughly knew them and would perform them beautifully .
She rejoiced the Head Royal Secretary Spinster by conferring on her the extraordinary honour of an invitation to breakfast : and , after breakfast , she requested her to read the reports aloud , but , finding that process would take two or three hours , she re - page : 155 quested her to leave off , turned over every page conscientiously , and wrote at the foot of the last , `` I have looked at all this set of reports and I think the handwriting very good .
( Signed ) DAFFODIL , THE DRESSMAKER PLENIPOTENTIARY . ''
`` It turned out easier than I thought it would , '' she said to herself  `` but I do n't much believe I shall get fond of it . ''
It felt strange to take the grand seat under the canopy of marsh marigolds where the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary sat amid her subordinates .
And , when she had got over her first shyness , she discovered that it was very dull to sit alone and silent in that vice-regal state .
By way of something to do she called the Head Royal Dressmaker to her and began to discuss the rotation of sleeves , which the Head Royal Dressmaker had suggested might be a little transposed with advantage : but , just as she was beginning to get interested , an urgent summons came from the Queen .
`` It would be unreasonable , '' said the Queen , `` to urge your Pre-eminence to have another great inspiration so soon after yesterday 's , but I think , as this is your first day in office , you might signalise it by some nice invention that would make everybody admire me at the Court Promenade to-day .
It must n't be the same as last night , and it must be different from everything else . ''
`` I will go to the wardrobe and manage some new sort of contrivance , '' answered Daffodil promptly .
`` That 's a dear ! ''
said Her Majesty .
`` You quite page : 156 deserve your promotion .
I am glad I did it - though it was rather unusual .
But , unusual or not , the world has learnt that I always reward true merit : and you certainly are an extraordinary sample of it '' `` I feel extraordinary , '' said Daffodil  `` but I suppose I shall get used to it . ''
She selected in the Queen 's wardrobe a red flower and a purple , of different kinds , with which she arranged a dress something like a fuchsia .
The fuchsia is not known in Croäxaxica , nor is any flower of that form , so this combination of hers would , she knew , be as novel to the Croäxaxicans as her first .
And in fact it produced scarcely less enthusiasm .
The Queen was radiant with triumph as she paraded in it .
`` I see I have made a judicious choice in your appointment , '' she said to Daffodil .
`` Go on as you are doing and you will repay my confidence . ''
Daffodil did go on as she was doing .
She did not , indeed , devise a new costume every day - that would have become difficult and was not desirable .
Her great ideas were to be for great occasions , or when some event was needed in times of monotony .
But her ingenuity was always ready at need , and her success was each time overwhelming .
She became one of the boasts of Croäxaxica .
Meanwhile Croässaquagha , the Private Under-Princess , once Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , was living in unassuming retirement .
Out of deference and loyalty , she appeared occasionally at Court  but she withdrew from all other participation in the splendours of society , and declared herself unsuited to etiquette .
She did not encourage interruptions of callers  she page : 157 wanted to live with her soul , she said , and to make the acquaintance of her own deepest mind  and besides she did not feel qualified to understand ordinary people .
She was not entirely solitary , however .
Prince Brekekex , Daffodil , the Regius Professor of Everything , and the Head Royal Physician , were frequently guests in the home which she smilingly called her hermitage , where , amid all the luxuries and refinements known to the Croäxaxicans , but with an absence of state and formalities which , she said , was to her at once novel and natural , like sea-water to an oyster bred without a taste of it , they conversed on the equal footing of friends .
Daffodil was , moreover , a welcome visitor at any hour , no matter how uncustomary , that she could find to slip away from her responsibilities and the Court .
The two were so confidential that they sometimes when alone together called each other Daffodil and Croässaquagha , instead of by their strict titles .
Croässaquagha took a lively interest in Daffodil 's inventions and devices , but she could not be persuaded to continue her own artistic career .
`` No , '' she would say , `` I will no longer drag down my art to outward manifestations .
The noblest creation , the most subtle completed work , is but a mockery of the far surpassing idea within us .
And why should I drudge for results ?
The world has you , peerless Daffodil , to give it those .
Your genius , stronger than mine , can submit to the trammels of execution and not be hampered  but mine feels the chain and faints .
Let me leave the frail exquisite spirit to its limitless freedom . ''
page : 158 `` But you must want something to do , '' said Daffodil .
`` I watch these natural artists make themselves into clothes , '' said Croässaquagha , pointing to the flowers growing in the shelves .
The two friends were sitting in the Under-Princess 's wardrobe .
`` They are lovely , '' said Daffodil .
`` But still you ca n't look at them the whole day every day , can you ? ''
`` Surely , '' replied the Under-Princess , `` why not ?
It is a high employment .
I learn much from them . ''
`` Then you are thinking of doing something in your art after all , '' said Daffodil .
`` Oh dear , no .
My Art is Me and I am my Art : why should I do anything ?
I feel myself becoming greater  and that is all that is necessary . ''
`` Well , I suppose it is , '' Daffodil answered musingly .
`` If people have nothing they can do except what is not very useful , and they dislike doing that , doing nothing seems to be all that it 's necessary for them to do .
But I should call it dreadfully tiring work . ''
The Private Under-Princess , however , did not show any signs of getting tired , as time went on : she looked the picture of content , and was every day more conscious of becoming greater .
Daffodil 's own intervals of independent leisure were not very numerous .
The duties of her office required much of her time , for , even when there was nothing for her to do but to sit under her canopy , she could not be somewhere else while she was doing it .
And she was in continual request among the members of the Royal Family .
She was a favourite with them all , and , though they had now to treat her with the page : 159 condescending respect due to her lofty station , they could not lose the habit of intimacy with her they had formed .
They wanted her help , they wanted her society .
Then , the second Princess , the Princess Guachapeara , developed a taste for art , and became Daffodil 's pupil .
And Prince Brekekex wanted her more than ever about his rhymes , for he was writing a tragedy in what are called decimalets , and had to make every ten lines rhyme together .
Moreover , this proved a year of great events in Croäxaxica , and not very many weeks would pass without a demand on the energy and talents of the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
There was the beginning to learn to read of the youngest Princess but one  then the coming of age of the Princess Guachapeara  the opening of a new main canal  the betrothal of the Princess Royal to the new-born son of the Duke of Happypool , a distant cousin of her Royal parents  most important of all , the birth of the Crown Prince 's future heir .
This last event gave Daffodil an opportunity , of which she had long been desirous , of visiting the kingdom of Grachidichika .
When the time came at which it was necessary for the Crown Prince and Princess to make a ceremonial visit to their Matrimonial Majesties , to introduce to them the baby Prince , their grandchild , the Crown Princess requested her to go as the Lady in Attendance , and she , although it was usual to offer this honour to ladies of a rank secondary to hers , was glad to consent .
It was with the pleasure of an inquiring traveller setting out under favourable auspices that she found herself starting in the procession about to swim , as page : 160 if on a journey , to the back garden and Grachidichika .
The route the procession took led them through almost all the principal canals of the town  then , by a more direct circuit , they reached the frontier , and , following round the whole ring of the boundary canal , arrived at the sole entrance to this isolated country , the low tunnel pierced through its massive earthen wall , or , rather , mound .
It seemed to Daffodil , as , after issuing from the tunnel , they passed along to the palace by a short but broad canal and then went turning about among corridors and house canals , that she was still in Croäxaxica after all .
The Great Throne Hall , too , seemed as if it were a bit of the Croäxaxican palace  it was but little smaller than the Croäxaxican throne hall and was very much like it - only somewhat in need of doing up .
It looked over large for the assemblage waiting in it - although that was more numerous than she had expected .
Everybody in Grachidichika , in fact , was there : there could have been no Court there at all if this had not been done .
Titles and high offices are borne for State occasions by most of the Grachidichikan inhabitants : these become invalid in ordinary moments , and the holders of them are then footmen or maids or whatever their vocation may be , and do not wear their robes of State .
The Guard of Honour consisted of the whole Army : but twelve seemed few to Daffodil , who had become accustomed to the hosts of the inimitable Croäxaxicans .
The Matrimonial King Regnant was sitting on the back of his throne with his feet on its arms , dandling a doll and croaking to it - which seemed page : 161 to Daffodil rather odd , and in marked contrast to the reverend calm of the Croäxaxican Monarch , of which his subjects were so proud .
He winked at her , too .
He was a shrivelled puny thing , looking top-heavy in his crown , and altogether Daffodil did not think much of him for a king .
The Queen was a homely visaged person , of robust frame but looking very old .
Her cheeks were rough with wrinkles , her hands were knobbed and hard like those of one who has done a great deal of rough work .
She sat slouchingly , and with her legs crossed anyhow , but her bearing otherwise was not without dignity , and she had a good business-like countenance , and looked as if nothing on earth would ever put it into her head to sit on the back of her throne unless the throne could happen to have no seat .
The State reception was short - because the baby cried .
This was caused by the King Regnant 's insisting on having it instead of his doll , which he handed in exchange to the Crown Princess .
He was quite willing to return it , however , when he found the noise it made .
He took back his doll with delight , and , as the visitors were departing in the solemn dignity with which they had entered , called back his daughter to inform her that that was the person he had selected to be his next wife .
page : 162 CHAPTER XIII .
NO sooner had the Crown Princess formally departed from Grachidichika than , leaving the procession , she slipped back , accompanied by Daffodil , for a quiet chat and a cup of five o'clock meadow-sweet water with her mother .
The old lady was talkative , and Daffodil was surprised to find what full intelligence she possessed of everybody 's affairs in Croäxaxica .
`` Ah , my dear , '' she said , when Daffodil expressed this surprise , `` I do n't let myself be quite shut out of life .
I ca n't go and come , but there are those that do .
There 's the Ambassador , now : he sees and hears a good deal of all sorts .
You see he 's a great man when he 's ambassadoring , and then he gets among the great people  and at other times he belongs to the middling folk and gets among them .
And then there are the servants . ''
`` But I thought they might not go out of Grachidichika . ''
`` And you thought right .
But may n't and do n't are not one word .
I happen to know - to tell you a secret - that one of the footmen has a sweetheart in Croäxaxica - in the very Royal Wardrobe-Seventy Seven And A Half - and it 's wonderful what page : 163 that man picks up in information .
It is n't so very often wrong either .
But , '' she interrupted herself , `` I am forgetting the wardrobe is under your own authority .
You wo n't let what I have said harm the girl ? ''
`` I will be kind to her , '' said Daffodil .
`` She 's not a bad girl at heart . ''
Her Matrimonial Majesty went on `` There 's the Royal Matrimonial Cook and Housemaid , too , she has a married sister in Croäxaxica whose daughters are all in service , and I 'm certain she must contrive too to get away there often or she could n't tell me all she does .
If I were to ask her she 'd say ` No ' - and so would the footman - so of course I look upon it in that light . ''
`` What should you have to do , your Matrimonial Majesty , if you looked on it in the other light ? ''
inquired Daffodil with some curiosity .
The Queen 's eyes twinkled shrewdly , `` I should have to prevent their going , '' she said .
`` I could get my dear Crown Prince to order some one to order some people to keep watching and find out , '' said the Crown Princess .
`` If I do n't forget , I will . ''
`` Do n't trouble about it , pet , '' replied her mother , and the Crown Princess went on drinking her meadow-sweet water .
She was very fond of conversation , but she liked other people to do the talking .
`` Yes , '' said the Queen Chachareraroncaxa , resuming her topic , `` Yes , yes  I hear plenty - Plenty of all sorts - Things sometimes that are perfectly scandals so that I forbid their being mentioned to any page : 164 one else for fear of mischief .
I always have set my face against gossip  but knowing something of other people 's doings gives an interest  and I do hear a good deal - I 'm able to say that much to my credit .
The worst is I 've nobody to tell things to now Ranacuajha has married and gone - not that she ever took much interest . ''
`` You must miss her , '' said Daffodil .
`` I should think I did !
But it 's her father who is the worst off without her .
She used to play with him .
He got his doll instead of her , when he first took to it . ''
`` I did n't like him to-day , '' said Ranacuajha .
`` My Crown Prince 's father sits quite still . ''
`` Do n't come here to criticise your father 's ways , Crown Princess Ranacuajha , '' said the Queen , displeased .
Daffodil intervened .
`` Is His Majesty always so - so playful ? ''
`` He has been all his life much the same as now , '' replied the Queen , `` and so was his father , and they say his grandfather was n't very much different .
There seems to be something that keeps the frogs of this Royal family of Grachidichika young - too young almost .
It does n't seem to tell so much on the frogesses - what there have been of them in the last generations .
It 's the dulness of the country , I believe . ''
`` It does not seem to have made you childish , '' remarked Daffodil .
`` Ah , I 'm a Croäxaxican .
And I have to work too hard to remember that I 'm dull . ''
`` Work too hard , Your Majesty ! ''
Daffodil repeated .
page : 165 `` You think that strange for a Queen .
But , where there 's a big house and next to no servants and little money , there 's plenty to do .
We should n't have the means for State on high occasions if we spent on being waited on and done for properly every day .
The fact is , my dear , the revenue of this kingdom has been this long while too small to keep it up .
I brought a nice little fortune when I married , but it got used up in building new roofs to the barracks when the old ones fell in , and in things like that .
I have to slave to make both ends meet , I can tell you . ''
`` It seems hard to be shut up in such a little country , and not have at least some comfort to make up for it , '' said Daffodil sympathisingly .
`` I thought it hard once , I believe  but I have forgotten all that long ago .
I 'm not sure if I do n't like it - the cooking at any rate - it has saved me from moping , I fancy .
I did mope a good deal the first year or two , before I began putting my hand to everything to get the servants on .
Well , it 's all the same : if I do have to do work your Queen would turn up her nose at , I 'm a Queen as well as she .
And I 'm of higher birth , too .
I am the great granddaughter of the second son of a King of Croäxaxica , and she is only the granddaughter of a third son of a King of Croäxaxica . ''
`` But does n't that make her a king 's great granddaughter , and you a king 's great great granddaughter ?
It makes her be the one of the highest birth , surely , '' said Daffodil .
`` What nonsense ! ''
cried the Queen Chachareraroncaxa .
`` Do n't you see that descent counts from the page : 166 founder of the family .
If the founder of my family was a King 's second son and the founder of hers was only a King 's third son , there is the fact , and it ca n't be argued away . ''
`` I wonder how she came to be able to marry the King - Crown Prince I suppose he was then , - without being the daughter of a King , '' Daffodil remarked in a pondering tone .
`` In exactly the same way that I came to be able to marry my one .
Neither of our husbands was Crown Prince at the time  each of them had an elder brother .
My King 's brother died of nothing particular - just of not having sense enough to keep alive - and her King 's brother died of poisoning himself accidentally with some weeds .
It was quite unexpected . ''
`` I suppose it would be , '' said Daffodil , as Queen Chachareraroncaxa paused for her to make a remark .
`` Well , well , '' Her Matrimonial Majesty resumed , `` Raucacoäxine is a good soul , but she was always a bit jealous of me .
And she did n't like it when I married .
You see we were both eligible .
And she had the best marriage-portion , so she made sure she was to become the Princess that would soon become Crown Princess that would soon become Queen of Grachidichika .
But my King - he was Royal and Matrimonial Prince Grenoulcrawk then - was let see us both , and she trod on him when she was hopping to the Queen his mother , not knowing he had taken it into his head to creep on the ground behind her to pinch her foot , for a joke , and he got a spite at her and could n't be made go near her again .
He 's not easy to thwart , he screams so .
I do n't believe page : 167 Raucacoäxine will ever quite forgive me in her secret heart for his choosing me . ''
Daffodil thought it only right to try to remove this impression concerning the Queen of Croäxaxica 's feelings from the Queen of Grachidichika 's mind .
But she soon saw that it was a sort of consolation to the poor battered Queen in her monotonous life to reflect that she was to some extent an object of jealousy .
`` Well , well , '' said the Queen , `` I do n't wonder .
It was all but marrying a downright Crown Prince , and I was n't a King 's daughter !
It was a wonderful distinction .
And then there was my beating her so much in handsomeness .
You 've heard of me as a beauty , of course . ''
`` They have not talked to me much about Grachidichika yet , '' said Daffodil apologetically .
`` Grachidichika , no : there 's nothing to set them talking about poor Grachidichika .
But I and my loveliness were Croäxaxican : Croäxaxica talks about ME . ''
The old lady as she spoke had more of the superb Croäxaxican bearing and tone than Daffodil had yet discovered in her .
But , before Daffodil could think of anything to say without either telling an untruth or paining her by the intelligence that Croäxaxica had lost all thought of her as if she had long ceased to exist , she resumed her confidential manner , and went on .
`` Well , well , beauty or anything else does n't make much difference where my life rubs on .
Raucacoäxine has had the best luck in the long run , though I am above her in personal standing through being a Queen long before she was even a Crown Princess . ''
page : 168 `` Queens of Croäxaxica are greater than Queens of Grachidichika , '' said the Crown Princess , `` and I am going to be one of them ! ''
`` Yes , darling , that you will .
And you 'll have a daughter Queen of Grachidichika , too , I hope , '' said the Queen tenderly .
Turning again to Daffodil she went on `` One Queen is as great as another .
Croäxaxica takes precedence of us , but it is because the kingdom was founded a little the first - mere seniority , not rank .
It 's quite proper that they should teach the Crown Princess to set store by her future position  but you ought to understand these matters clearly , or you might seem ignorant . ''
`` I should be sorry for that , '' replied Daffodil .
After they had done their meadow-sweet water , the Queen showed Daffodil the Kingdom .
It might have been a pretty Croäxaxican country-seat if it had been in better order .
One thing Daffodil thought really attractive , and that was the Royal Wardrobe .
The plants , seemingly left to grow their own way , had a natural freedom , and were mingled with a haphazard grace , that delighted her , and the vivid and delicate colouring of their blooms surpassed anything in Croäxaxica .
They were of all sizes , some very small , but some larger than she had ever seen .
The Queen smiled at her admiring exclamations .
`` Most people think this a sad scene of neglect , '' she said .
`` It was the most splendid thing of the kind in the world once .
There was a Matrimonial Queen , long ago , when the country was prosperous , who spent an enormous private fortune on it and got such flowers produced as never were known elsewhere .
But it has long been past hope page : 169 to keep it up .
There is a little wardrobe the house-servants manage tolerably carefully , cultivated for use , and this large Ancient Royal Wardrobe goes on growing like a wild-clothes thicket .
But there 's something in the soil and in the colour-water lighting the place that suits some flowers in an extraordinary way - no one knows now how the soil and the water were prepared , so flowers like some of these ca n't be grown elsewhere , cultivate how they may . ''
Out of doors they came to the barracks .
`` They are for a hundred , '' said the Queen ruefully .
`` A hundred is the proper number for our army .
But we 've hard enough trouble to find pay for the twelve , and you see we have to pay soldiers and the servants and anybody we employ to live in the kingdom four-fifths more than they could get in Croäxaxica , or they would n't come . ''
In the House of Parliament somebody was sitting .
`` It is the Speaker , '' said Her Matrimonial Majesty .
Daffodil expressed surprise at his being there at a time when , as she had been told , Parliament was in vacation .
`` Why , the fact is , '' was the reply , `` we have nowhere else to put him .
But he is quite safe . ''
She led the way to the door and let Daffodil squeeze herself in .
`` You can sit down on the chair for Members of Parliament , '' she said .
Daffodil sat down and gazed at the Speaker , who seemed to take no notice of anything .
`` Why .
He is only a stuffed Speaker ! ''
she presently exclaimed .
`` Of course he is , my dear , '' answered the Queen from the doorway .
`` And is n't it fortunate for us page : 170 and the country that he is ?
It would be quite impossible to find his salary if he were a live one , and then Parliament would have to be abolished .
They did away with Parliament in Croäxaxica several generations ago , because the members quarrelled so about their turn to recite their speeches  but there has never been any trouble with it in this Kingdom , because there is only room for one of the Members at a time and they take their turns in alphabetical order , each on a day to himself and as many hours as he likes - or only the minimum three minutes - just as he pleases .
The Speakers were the difficulty in ancient times : they used to get discontented , and there were instances of their running away and living in concealment out of the country , when their resignations were not accepted : but when this one died they stuffed him , and that has secured the institution down to these days . ''
`` It must be a great comfort to him to be only stuffed and not to hear all those speeches , '' said Daffodil .
They had now been nearly everywhere in the domain , and it was time for Daffodil to join the Crown Princess and go with her to Croäxaxica .
The Queen took her by a short cut through a long range of grounds cut into chequers , half a foot square , by runnels of brackish looking water .
What grew on the chequers was a long drooping stuff , looking something between grass and sea-weed  it curled over into the water and lay floating in it .
`` Do you know what this is ? ''
asked Chachareraroncaxa , with a rather melancholy smile , as they went along .
page : 171 `` Stuff people drink quantities of , '' Daffodil replied  `` but I do n't like it , it is so ditchy and so sweet . ''
`` It 's guggle-ooze '' said the Queen .
`` And these weeds that help to make it are the guggle-gigs you must often have seen , dried , at dessert and when people are going to sing and want to roughen their voices .
The earth they grow in is a wonderful tonic .
These are the revenue of Grachidichika - a splendid revenue once .
They used to grow only in this country .
Their price was very great , and the demand for them such that every bit of ground suitable for them was employed , even to the floor of the House of Commons . ''
`` I have seen weeds and water like this in Croäxaxica - often '' said Daffodil .
`` Yes  and there lies the ruin of the Grachidichikan treasury .
My King 's grandfather was coaxed by the Regius Professor of Everything to trust him with the secret of growing these .
The Professor tried the experiment in a plant-pot and succeeded : he was watched by one of his servants , who sold the knowledge to somebody , who began growing the things for sale , and then somebody watched him - and so the secret went on spreading till anybody can learn it and the things are grown and sold all over Croäxaxica .
We sell less and less every year .
And , if every inch of the kingdom could be turned to guggle-ooze grounds and all the produce were to find customers , there would n't be a quarter of the ancient income , at the price that 's got now . ''
Daffodil 's sympathy at the calamity which had overtaken the Royal and Matrimonial House was hearty , and her condolences gave Queen Chacharera - page : 172 roncaxa much satisfaction .
`` I 'll tell you something , my dear , '' she said by way of reward .
`` I know you can be trusted - I 've heard that of you from more than one .
Come here . ''
She led her to a tiny plot of ground with two chequers like those they had just left : but the weeds were bright scarlet and the water bluish-violet .
`` Taste them , '' she said .
Reluctantly Daffodil sipped some of the water out of the palm of her hand , and nibbled a bit of weed .
`` They taste very strong of themselves , '' she said .
`` That they do !
I could get the old price for them - and more too - and more than the old demand - if I only had a fortune to begin with .
It 's only to bring a canal from the Ancient Royal Wardrobe 's reservoir of lighting-water and mix it with what they grow in - and that reservoir is bottomless , so there is no fear of it 's not being enough .
We should have to make the workmen fill the canal from the brack-water reservoir , and to say nothing about using the other one , or else they would find out the secret in Croäxaxica and make a tunnel to get at the lighting-water .
But those two reservoirs are not far apart , and there are three labourer-servants I could trust - we could manage a secret conduit .
But , there !
It would cost more to get the canal cut than we shall ever have . ''
`` But how did the lighting-water get to these plants ? ''
inquired Daffodil .
`` Only by my carrying it secretly  '' said Her Majesty .
`` I thought perhaps something might be found by some accident some day to improve our guggle-gigs and give Grachidichika the market page : 173 again .
So I have tried one thing and another , by chance , for thirty years .
Nothing came of it , except sometimes killing the guggle-gigs - but , as they had so lost value and we 've always more than we can sell , that did n't matter .
And it gave an interest .
But at last this mixture has turned out right .
I never should have thought lighting-water could be good for anything to grow in .
But you see . ''
`` I wish I could think of some way for you to get the canal , '' said Daffodil .
`` There is no way .
It is the old story  to get wealth you must be wealthy . ''
As they walked on Daffodil asked the Queen whether it had taken her long to get used to Grachidichika .
`` No , '' she replied , `` it 's a sort of place you soon get used to .
You get dull at first , and then very soon you come not to care much about anything nor to miss anything .
You do n't seem to want a change  it does n't seem to matter . ''
Then she began to talk of her girlish days at home .
But Daffodil was so busy thinking that she only half heard , and presently she interrupted her with `` If I were you I would tell some rich person the secret , so that he might be willing to buy Grachidichika  and I would abdicate and sell it . ''
But Queen Chachareraroncaxa did not know the meaning of the word `` abdicate , '' and Daffodil had to explain .
She had scarcely begun when there was a strange interruption .
They had now come to the palace entrance , and , as they turned the corridor , something came flying at the Queen 's head and page : 174 hurled her to the ground .
As Daffodil rushed to her , the King sprang forward , chuckling , caught up the chair which had been his missile , and ran away .
The Queen lay stunned for a minute .
But , while Daffodil , supporting her head , was calling for help , she raised herself , quite revived and apparently unhurt .
`` I am used to it , '' she said .
`` You need n't mind .
He will do it .
Anybody he is fond of he plays tricks upon , and , as , of course , he is the fondest of me , I get the hardest bangs . ''
`` He should be whipped ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil indignantly .
She had been afraid the Queen was killed or dangerously hurt , and had not recovered her composure .
`` Of whom are you speaking , your Pre-eminence ? ''
said the Queen impressively .
And Daffodil thought it best to subside into a respectful silence .
`` His Matrimonial Majesty , the King Regnant of Grachidichika , my husband , is of a lively temperament , '' said Chachareraroncaxa with marked dignity .
`` He is , Your Matrimonial Majesty '' replied Daffodil .
They proceeded in silence to the Royal Private Drawing-room , where the Crown Princess was waiting , after a game of romps with her father .
But the Queen relaxed when Daffodil took leave , and dismissed her cordially .
She even gave her a kiss .
`` You are a chatty creature just like me , '' she said .
`` and you have quite cheered me up with your prattle .
- I wish you might often come and see me .
But you must come next time the Crown Princess can properly pay me a visit .
I am afraid that wo n't be till her next child is to be presented to us . ''
page : 175 `` Why ca n't we both come soon ? ''
said Daffodil .
`` It is impossible .
The relations between the two countries would get altered if communication were allowed to be easy .
And even the Crown Princess herself would be liable to attainder of high treason if she came here , except on the lawful State occasions .
It 's a long time to wait : but perhaps it 's as well it makes something to took forward to . ''
Daffodil went at once on her return to Croäxaxica to the Private Under-Princess .
The Private Under-Princess was allowed , as Ex-Dressmaker Plenipotentiary the privilege of selecting one or two special attendants from the Royal Wardrobe staff , and Daffodil wished her to ask for Seventy Seven And A Half .
It might be mischievous to have a gossip in the immediate service of the Royal Family , and it was clearly Daffodil 's duty to remove her , but she thought it probable that Croässaquagha would feel indifferent about an attendant 's reporting propensities , and that thus she might dispose of Seventy Seven And A Half , not only without injury to her , but to her advancement .
The Under Royal Wardrobe-maid would retain her place on the list and her right to rise in her turn , on promotions occurring higher up on the list , and would continue to draw her salary from the State , while her new position would confer on her special rank and privileges .
It proved , as Daffodil expected , that the Private Under-Princess saw no difficulty in acceding to her request .
`` Of course we must reprove her about the gossiping , and try and cure her of it , '' said Daffodil .
`` Only , I would rather wait a little , so that she may not perceive where I got my information .
I do n't page : 176 want to bring the Queen of Grachidichika into the matter . ''
`` Why try to cure her ? ''
replied Croässaquagha .
`` If she is with me , let her gossip .
True greatness likes to be gossiped about .
It has not to fear the loss of its brilliancy by being looked at in all its phases .
When , as I venture to hope is the case in my humble instance , greatness consists in one 's Self , not merely in rank or achievements , the more that is known about one 's Self the better . ''
`` Still , it wo n't be right of her to gossip about you , '' said Daffodil .
`` You shall tell her not , '' said Croässaquagha .
`` That will make you have done what you think right : and she will gossip about me all the more , for she will fancy my life has secrets . ''
As Daffodil lay in bed that night , she thought sorrowingly over what seemed to her the dreary imprisonment of the Queen of Grachidichika in her wailed-in dead-alive little kingdom .
She formed a plan for inventing some remarkable costume for the Crown Princess 's baby and getting the occasion pronounced one on which he ought to be presented again to their Matrimonial Majesties of Grachidichika , so that Queen Chachareraroncaxa might have more promptly than she expected the pleasure of the visit to which she was looking forward .
She little thought that Chachareraroncaxa was just then breathing her last .
The blow she received on the head , when the King threw the chair at her , had caused fatal injury , and that night , before it was well understood that she was ill , the Queen of Grachidichika was no more .
page : 177 CHAPTER XIV .
ABOUT a fortnight after the sad event recorded in the last chapter , the Crown Prince returned from a visit of condolence to the widowed King , looking very thoughtful .
He took off his condolence clothes in a hurry , and , the moment he was cheerfully dressed , he sent for the Head Royal Physician .
After that interview , he went to seek the Queen , his mother .
He found her in her Royal Private Garden , sitting alone with Prince Brekekex - the Royal Princesses and the Lords and Ladies in Waiting being engaged in practising swimming minuets in another part of the garden .
`` This just suits , '' said the Crown Prince : `` I wanted to talk with you both without listeners .
We must make haste .
Now the King of Grachidichika has not the Queen to attend to him , he is breaking fast .
And he frets so after her that it does him harm .
I have just seen the Head Royal Physician , and he says the throne will be vacant within three months . ''
`` So he told me yesterday on his return from Grachidichika , '' replied the Queen .
`` But why should we make haste ?
We do n't want the throne vacant .
And what could we do , if we did ? ''
page : 178 `` Is Brekekex to be the next king ? ''
`` Of course , '' said the Queen .
`` It will be terribly dull for him , but it ca n't be helped . ''
`` I 'd much rather not , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` I 'd rather he were n't , myself , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` I like him here for company .
And I thought of making him Prime Minister when I become King . ''
`` Prime Minister ! ''
gasped the Queen .
`` Why , Majestic Mother , I must restore the office , when it comes to my time , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` It 's all very well for my father , but you must remember that my wife , though she is perfection in her own quiet way , has not got your masculine energy , and I should have to do all the governing , myself .
If a king is to have the trouble of governing , I do n't see what use there is in being a king at all . ''
`` That is true , '' said the Queen with an approving smile .
`` I know I can always trust your penetrating insight and foresight , my dear son .
It did not occur to me , when I arranged that your father should abolish Prime Ministers for ever , that no other king of Croäxaxica would have a wife exactly like me .
Under the circumstances I do not blame your project . ''
`` But I should not like to be Prime Minister , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` I had much rather be King of Grachidichika than that .
I tell you that  I tell you flat  I will not work , Thought I will shirk .
Work mars one 's calm , thought makes one 's verses sinister : How can a Poet stoop to be Prime Minister ? ''
page : 179 `` Brekekex 's high-souled argument is irresistible , '' said the Queen .
`` And , besides , he must take the throne when it comes to him , because , even if it were Constitutional to let somebody that was not of the immediate Royal Family become of a higher rank than the King and Queen of Croäxaxica 's sons and daughters , there is nobody to inherit instead but the Duke of Happypool .
As there is at present only that one husband to be had for all your sisters , it is all very well to have betrothed Happypool 's baby to the Princess Royal for when it grows up  but the Duke has always been troublesome and insubordinate .
You remember that at one time he was absolutely under sentence of being swallowed for his encouragement of the Prime Minister , only the Royal Family would have had to go into mourning , as he is a kinsman , and it would have been so awkward for the Royal Family to be in mourning for a traitor , so he was pardoned .
He really can not be trusted to be King of Grachidichika .
If he were sulky about anything , he would be capable of illegally marrying his children to anybody , to stop our supplies . ''
`` Take one of my sisters , '' said Brekekex .
`` The female mind has so divine a grace , Whatever male minds find too dull and base Is just what our sweet sisters should desire , And in its joyful practice never tire . ''
`` You do n't always put such good sense as that in your verses , '' observed the Crown Prince .
This made Prince Brekekex angry .
`` You show your ignorance , '' he said .
`` Good sense has nothing to do with my verses : it is n't good sense but high truths you should talk about to a poet . ''
page : 180 `` Never mind , '' interposed Her Majesty .
`` Your brother only meant to express appreciation of your true and noble view of our tender feminine sphere .
But , as to your proposal  I do n't see how it could be carried out .
The treaty which founded the State Matrimonial provided for a King Regnant , not a Queen .
And a reigning Queen would be such a strange anomaly .
There can never have been one in the world .
I really could not consent to such an indelicate arrangement . ''
`` Nor I , '' said the Crown Prince .
So Prince Brekekex had to agree to devote himself for the welfare of the two Kingdoms and become King of Grachidichika .
But two great concessions were made to him .
It was agreed that , considering his close relationship to the King of Croäxaxica , he might be allowed a window-hole in the wall of his Kingdom , with a transparent fountain glazing , through which to peep into Croäxaxica .
This window , it was to be provided by a solemn treaty , would be built up on the accession of Brekekex 's successor .
And Brekekex was , by a secret clause in the treaty , to be empowered to pay unrecognised visits to the neighbour Kingdom .
About the latter clause there at first seemed to be difficulty past getting over , for the rule by which except on the Extraordinary ( and now , from the poverty of Grachidichika , impossible ) Event of a Royal State Visit , the Sovereigns and their wives could not be seen in each other 's country , even if they hid themselves by fancy names , had never been broken , and to disregard it might seriously disturb the relations between the two countries .
But Prince page : 181 Brekekex bethought him of a plan which removed all diplomatic inconvenience : he proposed that he should come to Croäxaxica , not merely incognito as the Royal Princely Bridal Pairs did during the period assigned to their visit to Grachidichika , but in disguise .
In ancient times Croäxaxica had possessed wandering troubadours , who sang and recited their own verses for hours together and thus were welcome everywhere and treated as honoured guests even in the Royal Palace : it was several hundred years since the last of these had died , but they were still mentioned in story books , so that all educated Croäxaxicans had heard of them .
As a troubadour then , under the name of Kekebrex the Croaker , Prince Brekekex - or rather King Brekekex , as he would be then - would unassumingly share the delights of his parents ' court and enrapture his native land with the poems achieved in the calm solitudes of his own Kingdom .
Nobody must be allowed to recognise him , and it must be customary frequently to speak in his presence of King Brekekex of Grachidichika and to refer to that monarch as far distant in his own capital .
If , at any time when he had gone into Croäxaxica , his Queen particularly wanted to speak to him about anything or to know if he was coming back to dinner , she was to be permitted to send a servant who must have the title of Secret Messenger , and he , on his side , might on like emergencies send into Grachidichika a personal follower of his own who must have the title of Trusty Henchman .
But the sending of these messengers was to be refrained from as much as possible .
By the time all this was arranged , Brekekex had page : 182 become cheerful .
`` I shall be every inch a king , '' he said , `` and yet twice as many inches a poet !
King Brekekex the greatest poet - Kekebrex the Croaker , the renowned Matrimonial King Regnant !
They 'll call me the Poet-King .
That 'll be it - Brekekex the Great , the Poet-King !
Oh !
oh !
oh ! ''
and he hopped about singing `` Poet King Brekekex !
King poet Brekekex !
What a mind multiplex !
Hullabaloo !
Kekebrex King and troubadour too !!! ''
`` Your remarks are very true and practical , '' said the Crown Prince , after waiting some time for his brother to leave off  `` but , as you have now made them several times , I do not conceive that you need state them over again for reconsideration .
Now we have settled about you , we have to make arrangements for providing a Queen of Grachidichika . ''
`` I do n't see that we are called on to do that , '' said the Queen .
`` You are well aware that a King of Grachidichika can marry no one but a daughter of the then reigning King of Croäxaxica .
Properly it should be the Princess Royal - and , of course , if necessary , we could change the betrothal and let it be Guachapeara who waits for Happypool 's baby instead of Zumbarzabulixine - but I do n't think it would be quite fair to any of your sisters to marry her now when King Grenoulcrawk has such a short time to live .
It would only be a few weeks before she had to go into the Workhouse for Failures from Grachidichika , as a Queen widow who leaves no children for marriage with Croäxaxica .
If Grenoulcrawk presses us for a wife , we have only to take page : 183 a sufficient time over the negotiations and they will drag on till it is too late for him . ''
`` I was not thinking of the present king , '' replied the Crown Prince .
`` I learn he is satisfied with his doll as the new Queen , calling her Zumbarzabulixine , as if she were our Princess Royal .
That removes diplomatic complications in that quarter .
It is Brekekex whose Queen it will be difficult to provide . ''
The Queen looked displeased .
`` I do not imagine that my son , Prince Brekekex , will find aught but ecstasy and gratitude wherever his choice may fall .
Difficulty is a strange word for the marriage of a son of the King and Queen of Croäxaxica . ''
`` Quite so , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` The parents of anybody Brekekex chose would be overjoyed , and so would she .
So far there is no difficulty whatever .
The only inconvenience is that , when he is a king , there will be no one for him to choose .
There is not one being in existence - nor even any parents of her in existence - to make him a wife when he is king . ''
`` Then I wo n't be king , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` Grachidichika ca n't be undertaken with no one to take the trouble off one 's hands .
Besides I should like a wife .
One needs a well-trained angel by one 's side The two halves of one 's ills to bear with pride , To laugh at all one 's jokes , shake at one 's rages , Praise , serve , admire one , and save servants ' wages . ''
`` Good sense again , '' muttered the Crown Prince .
But before Prince Brekekex could resent the com - page : 184 ment the Queen struck in .
`` Oh my far-seeing perfect statesman of a son ! ''
exclaimed she to the Crown Prince , `` How did you make this discovery ?
It had escaped myself .
You are right - only too right : Brekekex can not marry any one of the only persons eligible for wives of the King of Grachidichika - no , nor even all of them together .
They are all his sisters .
Poor dear fellow , what will he do in Grachidichika , an unprotected master of a house ? ''
Prince Brekekex wept .
He could not speak .
`` Just so , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` And besides , if he never marries , the Royal Matrimonial supply will be stopped for years and years .
It wo n't do .
He must marry while he is still a junior prince of Croäxaxica .
That will give him a wider choice . ''
`` Too wide , '' sighed Prince Brekekex .
`` True , '' said the Queen , `` She is very wide .
And I do n't think she will do even as well as waiting till somebody gets married and somebody gets born and grows up . ''
`` He will be king long before all that can happen , '' the Crown Prince replied .
`` Ah I forgot .
But the Duke of Happypool 's aunt Grufrana is so old , and her enormous fatness makes her so helpless . ''
`` And she is so cross , and so greedy , and so stupid , and so altogether disgusting ! ''
protested Brekekex , rousing from his despondency to more and more decision as he spoke .
`` And she is so lazy , and so extravagant , '' added the Queen .
`` She would never do for Grachidichika . ''
`` And she is deaf , and almost blind , '' said Prince page : 185 Brekekex .
`` She would not know one song of mine from another . ''
`` There is another important point , too , '' said the Queen : `` her husband is alive , although he has been bedridden ten years . ''
`` There is force in all these arguments , '' said the Crown Prince in a thoughtful tone .
`` And besides , '' said Brekekex , `` I wo n't marry her . ''
`` It 's awkward not , '' said the Queen , `` as there is no one else suitable .
But I really do n't see how you can . ''
`` I wo n't , '' replied the Prince resolutely .
`` And , when I am determined , I am determined . ''
Upon this it became evident to all three that nothing could be done .
Brekekex must go wifeless .
Day after day the discussion was resumed , and nothing fresh to say could be found .
`` Something may turn up , if we keep talking over the matter , '' said the Queen hopefully  and Brekekex found solace in writing poems on his melancholy plight  but the Crown Prince shook his head and asked what would become of Croäxaxica if the Royal Matrimonial Family of Grachidichika was to be an old bachelor .
The Regius Professor of Everything was taken into consultation , and shook his head too .
One day , as they were discoursing on the question for the sixth time since the morning , and the ninety-ninth time since the beginning of the discussions , the Crown Prince grew desperate .
`` There is one way out of it , '' said he .
`` Happypool must be King of Grachidichika . ''
`` He sha n't , '' said the Queen .
page : 186 `` He ca n't , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` How can I be a troubadour , if he has my throne ? ''
`` Our own Royal Family may become extinct if , in the present state of affairs , we have a King of the Matrimonial State who can never get married , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` What does the Professor say ? ''
they all asked eagerly .
`` I consider it a terrible crisis , '' replied the Regius Professor of Everything .
`` There ! ''
exclaimed each of the three triumphantly .
The Professor 's decision , however , although so satisfactory to each debater , did not remain final .
The Queen and the Crown Prince continued to differ as to the arrangement to be made , and Brekekex , leaving the argument to them , wept over the loss of his crown , or the loneliness of his livelong bachelorhood , according to which alternative was being brought forward .
All at once , Her Majesty sprang into the air and turned a summersault .
`` I have an idea , '' she explained when she came down .
Brekekex clasped his hands .
`` I am saved ! ''
he cried .
`` Oh , sublest mind that ever yet uncurled Its coils of diplomation to the world ! ''
Those lines came from his poem `` Greatness in the Base , '' where he described the Queen 's cleverness about Daffodil and Seventy Seven And A Half .
`` Stop ! ''
said the Queen , who was just going to speak .
`` Those admirable lines have suggested an addition to my idea .
Let me reflect . ''
page : 187 The plan Her Majesty presently revealed was intended to gain time .
`` It strikes me , '' she said , `` that the Duke of Happypool may have another baby some day , and it may be a girl .
Now , if we could manage that Brekekex should not be King before it was born , he could marry it , and , when he became King soon after , he could take it to Grachidichika to be brought up .
Well , Grenoulcrawk might perhaps be kept alive a little longer , if he had a wife to take the very greatest possible care of him - and , of course , she would do that , whoever she was , because she would have to be removed from the list of the Matrimonial Royal Family and sent to the Workhouse as soon as she let him die .
We must get him married at once . ''
`` Magnificent ! ''
burst from the lips of the Regius Professor .
But the two Princes looked disappointed .
`` Bringing up that baby will be trying , '' said Brekekex , in a pondering tone .
`` And it will be so many years before it can do any government . ''
`` It must inevitably take the baby some time to grow to be the mother of a Matrimonial Family , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` And , then , if Brekekex is to reserve the baby that you mean to have born before King Grenoulcrawk dies , and if Happypool does not have another daughter , there will be no wife ready for my eldest son when he is old enough to have one . ''
`` Oh , that is sure to come right , '' said the Queen .
`` And , if not , he will only have to wait a few years for a cousin .
She will be a much fitter match for a future King of Croäxaxica , as she will be daughter of a King .
And , you know , he would be able to marry page : 188 her at any time , even if he had become Crown Prince , or even King . ''
`` Well , '' said the Crown Prince , somewhat sombrely , `` it sounds conclusive , though somehow I do n't like it .
I suppose we had better consider it settled .
It 's rather hard on Zumbarzabulixine . ''
`` Wait a minute , '' replied the Queen .
`` Here is the beauty of my plan .
We 'll get King Grenoulcrawk to abdicate for three days in favour of Brekekex : he will , in the three days , as only a Junior Prince as he used to be , be able to marry somebody that is not our Princess Royal - nor even a Royal Princess at all .
After he is married , Brekekex can abdicate in his favour at once , so that there should be nothing unfair to poor Grenoulcrawk . ''
All declared that part of the plan admirable .
`` And , now , '' said the Queen , elated by their praises , `` listen to what our poet 's quotation has put into my head : the point is to find a wife for Grenoulcrawk - even counting him as a Younger Prince , I did not see who there could be he might legally marry - I thought we might have to decree somebody Royal for him , just for the time - it would n't matter so much for him , you know , if we could do it .
But it has flashed upon me that there is one person not of Royal Kin who can be a wife for a Younger Prince of Croäxaxica , so of course she can be for a Grachidichikan Prince .
Brekekex 's lines have made me think of the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
I believe it was enacted long ago that , when there was no other wife for a younger Prince of Croäxaxica , the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary should be eligible . ''
`` Splendid ! ''
exclaimed her hearers .
`` What talent !
page : 189 What memory of the laws !
What a power of combination ! ''
`` And I think , '' said the Queen , `` we can take the opportunity to make Guachapeara Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
She is getting on so fast that she is sure to acquire more genius than anybody has yet had , if we give her the opportunity of displaying it .
And there have been precedents for a Younger Royal Princess holding the office . ''
And thus the matter was settled .
The conference broke up , having agreed that the Queen should take steps at once for the temporary abdication of King Grenoulcrawk and his marriage with Daffodil .
page : 190 CHAPTER XV .
QUEEN RAUCACOƒXINE was too much pleased with her scheme for the settlement of the Grachidichikan difficulty to waste time in reconsidering it .
She set to work at once .
The first thing she did was to send for the Princess Guachapeara and tell her all about the Dressmaker Plenipotentiaryship .
Guachapeara was overjoyed .
Although she had , of course , been aware that , as soon as she had made progress enough to allow of attention being called to her selection of a tasteful career , her position as a Royal Artist would be of the most distinguished character , she had not been able to anticipate so marked an announcement to the world of her exceptional capacity as was now proposed .
She kissed her mother over and over again .
`` You dear magnificent darling ! ''
she said enthusiastically , `` What a thing it is to have a mother who can appreciate one !
I was beginning to think I should never learn to be an artist after all , because of Art being so stupid and wasting one 's time so after things that always turn out different from how one expected , but now I feel quite sure I shall get on .
Of course a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary always is a great artist . ''
page : 191 `` Quite so , '' said the Queen , fondly stroking her daughter 's cheek .
`` The greatest of living artists , must n't she be ? ''
continued the delighted young princess .
`` It is her privilege to be so - and in fact her duty , '' replied Her Majesty .
`` And , my dear Guachapeara , I hope , young as you are , that you will remember duty .
Of course I shall see that you have some one to take all trouble off your hands  but I shall expect you to have genius like the other great artists , your predecessors - or in fact rather more .
It is only to make up your mind that you will . ''
`` Oh yes , '' said Princess Guachapeara , '' I promise you that that shall be all right , '' and , clapping her hands in glee , she exclaimed `` Only think !
it was but yesterday that that horrid Lady Grufrana and the Duke of Happypool were agreeing it was ridiculous for me to be taking lessons from the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary - ' I was a born bungler like you ' - and now they 'll see that , instead of being a bungler like you , I have been able to be actually a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary when I am but just of age .
There never can have been a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary only just of age before .
As to Daffodil , one can see by her size that she must have come of age twenty years ago and gone on growing ever since . ''
But , while Guachapeara was running on thus triumphantly , the Queen was leaning back faint and gasping .
`` Oh !
What is the matter ! ''
cried Guachapeara , when , pausing and looking for an answer , she observed her mother 's condition .
But the Queen was unable to speak .
In a fright , the Princess splashed water over the sufferer , and then , screaming for help the while , set page : 192 to shaking her vigorously .
Under this treatment , the Queen recovered herself .
`` Hush !
hush ! ''
she said , as soon as she could command a voice , `` Call no one .
What has passed must never be revealed .
A BUNGLER LIKE ME !!!
Guachapeara , the awful words must be forgotten .
There is only one expiation possible for the crime of Happypool and his aunt - the Boa Constrictor .
And , if I allow this expiation to Happypool , your sister Zumbarzabulixine can not marry his son , and Brekekex can not marry his daughter when she gets born , and there wo n't ever again be a husband or a wife in the world for one of all the Royal Family .
But , remember , the crime of such words is unforgivable - forgiveness itself would be a crime .
Therefore I am not aware of them : you are not aware of them : nobody is aware of them : in fact they never were spoken .
Who repeated them to you ? ''
`` I overheard them myself , '' answered the Princess .
`` It was at the Lord Chamberlain 's pond party .
They thought no one was near them  but I happened to have swum under a floating sofa to fasten my head-rushes , and they came and sat on it . ''
`` Then bear in mind not to have heard them , '' said the Queen .
`` I will make a point of forgetting , '' said Guachapeara , obediently .
`` And mind , '' urged the Queen , to add yet more weight to her injunction , `` if you let this fearful secret pass your lips , you will not be a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
Everything depends on our arranging so that a wife can be born for Brekekex , and , if you stop her having a father , there is an end of it all . ''
page : 193 It may well be imagined that , in spite of her Majesty 's anxiety not to have to deal with the Duke of Happypool as a traitor , she was more than ever convinced of his disqualifications for the throne of Grachidichika , and that , even if the heir-apparent whose position had to be made sure had not been her own son , she would have been resolute in any measure that would prevent a necessity for his being set aside in favour of so evil-minded a rival .
The naive joy of Guachapeara confirmed her also in her choice of a wife for King Grenoulcrawk .
It was only by this promotion of Daffodil that the post of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary could well be at her disposal .
And , moreover , the obstacles in the way , if she were to try to select any other bride , were serious , for , except her own daughters and Lady Grufrana , who was married , there was no existing person besides Daffodil whom the law recognised as able to contract marriage with a member of either of the Reigning Houses .
The ambassador of Grachidichika , summoned to Queen Raucacoäxine 's presence , listened in bewilderment and kept agreeing to everything .
But , when at last he made out what was proposed , he expressed unlimited acquiescence in a scheme so admirably adapted to promote every one 's interests , and only suggested that , although the marriage was to be that of a Grachidichikan Junior Prince and not of a King of Grachidichika , his fee for ambassadorial attendance on the occasion ought to be what it would if the King could have remained King during the marriage days .
To this Her Majesty graciously consented .
The marriage , of course , was to be celebrated on the page : 194 simpler scale prescribed for that of a Younger Prince , and not as that of a Sovereign , and also , on the excuses of King Grenoulcrawk 's being in mourning for his Queen and of his infirm health and of the bride 's not being of Royal Kin , it was to be of the shortest and simplest kind allowable for a Junior Prince in an emergency , so as only to take three days and not to require the attendance of an official embassy from Croäxaxica .
Thus the alternate abdications of Grenoulcrawk and Brekekex - which were an awkward part of the transactions - would be over before anything about them was known in Croäxaxica , and would scarcely be heard of , and the peculiar circumstances of the marriage would not be forced on public attention .
The ambassador felt sure of King Grenoulcrawk 's co-operation , if the matter was put before him in an encouraging light , and undertook to get him through the proceedings in a sufficiently satisfactory manner .
So far all had gone in the smoothest possible way  but now the poor Queen was destined to meet with contradiction and grumbling on every side .
There was the King , to begin with : instead of simply approving her project and giving her instructions to do whatever she liked about it , he , in a wholly unprecedented way , insisted on considering the subject , and demurred .
There might have been Sovereigns who abdicated , either among the Croäxaxicans themselves or among the neighbouring nations in the almost pre-historic of the inimitable Croäxaxicans ' times dwelling above ground - at any rate such an event was admitted by abstruse writers as an abstract possibility in the scheme of government - but there page : 195 was no known instance of anything of the sort .
The King did not at all like introducing the notion in a practical shape .
`` Reflect , '' he said portentously : `` if a King abdicates , a King will have abdicated . ''
It was only by the most pertinacious entreaties and preventing his going to sleep that Raucacoäxine convinced him of the desirability of his consenting .
And , even after his consent had been won , his dissatisfaction was testified for many hours by voluminous snores - a sure sign of sulkiness in that usually sedate monarch .
Then the Crown Prince gave way to second thoughts , and became full of doubt and discontent .
It had occurred to him that , even if the Duke of Happypool had another daughter besides the one that was to be born for Brekekex , his eldest son , if he happened to have become Crown Prince by the time he was old enough to take a wife , could not marry her unless her father were King of Grachidichika .
At this the Queen went into a violent passion , and even threatened to have him charged with treason and conspiracy .
The Crown Prince , though he admitted that it was hard on his brother to suggest his being passed over to let the Duke of Happypool have the crown of Grachidichika , protested that he had a right to speak of such a thing in the interests of the Croäxaxican dynasty  and , as he did not know what good reason his mother had to be infuriated at the very name of Happypool , he could not understand how he had so greatly provoked her by what he had been saying , and he considered himself aggrieved .
He withdrew in dudgeon , and would not appear at court .
page : 196 The next trouble was with Prince Brekekex .
He too had been thinking over the scheme and had discovered that he did not like it .
He thought it very hard on Daffodil that she was to be married in a way which would make her very soon a prisoner in the Workhouse for Failures , and very hard on himself that he was to be thus permanently deprived of her services as his purveyor of rhymes .
And he urged these views so eloquently that the Queen burst into tears and , declaring that her own son , for whose sake she was undergoing so much labour and vexation , was accusing her of cruelty , ordered him to his own apartments under arrest .
Next the Regius Professor of Everything came with an anxious face .
After reflection and research , he had arrived at the conclusion that it was doubtful whether a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was legally eligible as a wife for any Grachidichikan Prince .
The enlargement of the list of persons with whom junior members of the Royal Family could incur marriage if persons of equally royal birth were not available had been made for the Croäxaxican Family only , it having been always held that the destiny of members of the Royal Matrimonial Family of Grachidichika was to provide the Royal Family of Croäxaxica with wives and husbands , and no other provision than their Workhouse having been thought necessary for those of them who failed to fulfil their destiny .
Her Majesty was highly displeased at the Professor 's statement , which she looked on as disrespectful to the Royal house of Croäxaxica .
`` If a person is equal by law to marrying a member of our Royal House , I should think she must be legal page : 197 enough for Grachidichika ! ''
she exclaimed indignantly .
The Professor , alarmed , began trying to explain that he had meant to explain that it was because of the inferiority of the Grachidichikan dynasty to the Croäxaxican that the obstacle he mentioned existed , but his nervousness confused him , and he only made the Queen more dissatisfied with the irreverent conceptions she understood him to be expressing .
And she ended by banishing him from the court and capital , with the assurance that , if he ventured to repeat such sentiments to any one whatever , the State Boa Constrictor should end his treasonable discourses .
The Head Royal Physician annoyed her almost as much .
He came , by the Crown Prince 's direction , to communicate his opinion on the possibility of King Grenoulcrawk 's living long enough for her plan for a wife for Prince Brekekex to be carried out .
Nothing but a miracle , he said , could keep the decrepit and enfeebled monarch alive long enough for the baby to be born and married to Prince Brekekex before his throne became vacant .
`` Sir , '' said the Queen - superb rebuke in her voice and mien - `` the interests at stake are those of two Kingdoms and My son .
If a miracle is necessary , there will be a miracle . ''
The Head Royal Physician felt very uneasy at having anything more to say after that , but he was still more afraid of not warning her Majesty of a danger to her plans which it might afterwards ruin him to have concealed from her .
He told her that King Grenoulcrawk , unable to understand the meaning of his temporary abdication , had been so unpleasantly agitated on the page : 198 ambassador 's mentioning it to him , that he had had a fit , and that there was much reason to fear that his bewilderment and the excitement and fatigue of the marriage solemnities might throw him into a sudden and fatal illness .
On this Her Majesty gave vent to an indignation which wavered in its cause between distrust of the Head Royal Physician 's veracity in his statements about King Grenoulcrawk 's condition and disgust at his incompetence and blundering in not having his Royal Patient in fitting health at so important a crisis .
She ordered him off at once to Grachidichika , there to remain by the King night and day .
In consequence of which when , that night , she found herself suffering from a headache caused by all these annoyances , there was no Head Royal Physician available in her need .
And , as if all this opposition was not enough to bear , the Queen was still further oppressed by the lamentations of her daughters over their loss of Daffodil .
The Princesses of all ages , and even including Guachapeara who had so much to gain by Daffodil 's departure , were full of the many ways in which they should miss her , and they could not reconcile themselves to her being , first by her exaltation to Queendom in Grachidichika , with its necessary isolation , and then by her inevitable degradation to namelessness in the Workhouse for Failures , wholly removed from their reach .
They had , indeed , no adverse arguments with which to tease the Queen : as the Princess Royal said , they could not be so selfish as to wish to see Daffodil prevented from receiving the extraordinary promotion intended for her and they did not grudge her the boon - nay they declared page : 199 her quite worthy of it , surprising as the rise of her fortunes seemed - but they could not help harping on their own grievances in the matter of her loss .
The Queen , who herself shared some of these feelings and looked on it as vexatious that she could not both make Daffodil King Grenoulcrawk 's Queen and caretaker and keep her to be useful in Croäxaxica , was so fretted by these lamentations that she had to avoid her daughters ' company .
In all these troubles her Majesty 's spirits were somewhat kept up by the amusement and pleasure with which she thought of the surprise she was going to give the unconscious Queen-elect .
She would not let Daffodil know anything about what was going on until all , even to the details of the wedding and the date and ceremonies for Daffodil 's own coronation and for the recrowning of Grenoulcrawk after his abdication was over , had been agreed by both sides and all the treaties and contracts were finally signed .
The negotiations were not allowed to take more than a day or two - time being so valuable - and therefore it was not very difficult to keep them a secret , even from the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary .
As soon as all was irrevocably settled , the Queen sent for the bride and , chuckling to herself over the shock of startled delight she would experience at the sudden news , told her the story of her greatness .
But what was her amazement when Daffodil , instead of going out of her senses with elation at the incredible honour bestowed upon her , flatly refused to be the King of Grachidichika 's wife .
`` I do n't mind Grachidichika much , and I do n't see that the Workhouse would be page : 200 inconvenient for a person that has n't been brought up to Croäxaxican luxuries , '' said Daffodil , when Her Majesty spoke against what she supposed to be her objections , `` but I would rather not marry that King : though , as it is such a great honour , it was very kind of you to think of it for me . ''
The Queen had no time for arguing , so she at once explained the important considerations , as to Prince Brekekex 's succession to the throne of Grachidichika and the matrimonial question , which necessitated Daffodil 's marriage to King Grenoulcrawk , supposing that such a statement would at once end all objection .
But , to her horror , Daffodil , after pausing to reflect , replied with a counter proposal that the law should be altered and that Prince Brekekex should be made able to marry anybody he and his parents liked , instead of having to wait for somebody to be born on purpose .
And , perceiving the Queen 's speechless consternation at such a suggestion , the misguided child endeavoured to justify the policy of it by the argument that perhaps the requisite baby might never come at all , or might die before it grew up .
Perhaps the Queen might have borne Daffodil 's conduct with more patience if she had not already been so grievously tried by the others : as it was , she was in no mood for controversy .
`` Be silent , '' she cried , `` and answer this moment .
Do you hear ? ''
`` Yes , Your Majesty , '' replied Daffodil , submissively , `` only I do not know what to answer to . ''
`` That is final , '' said the Queen .
And she left the room .
Daffodil , in some anxiety , but sure that , at all page : 201 events , she could not be compelled to marry King Grenoulcrawk in spite of herself , and hoping the Queen meant to renounce her project , returned to her own apartment .
It was getting on towards evening and , as it happened that there was no special engagement to tie her , she had been intending to go and dine with the Private Under-Princess .
But she considered that she should feel embarrassed in keeping from her friend the critical position in which she found herself  and she did not think it would be prudent to reveal it .
She feared , moreover , that , if she had to be in disgrace for refusing to yield to the Queen 's wish , Croässaquagha might , were she to be with her at this critical moment , be entangled in her misfortune .
So she remained at home by herself , feeling very lonely .
She was not afraid , but she felt that she should have been less as if she were going to be afraid if she had had somebody to whom she could talk about it .
All the evening she kept expecting some message from the Queen , or that something would happen , or somebody come .
But the hours went on and no notice was taken of her .
`` I should have liked to know whether I am to be in disgrace or not , '' she said to herself , at last  `` but it is too late now for there to be any chance of the Queen 's sending for me tonight .
I had better go to bed .
And I shall know all about it to-morrow .
I daresay it will all come right , like the other things that have happened to me here . ''
But in the middle of the night a sound at the entrance to her sleeping place awoke her , and she beheld the Officer in Command , with six soldiers ranged behind him .
`` Hush ! ''
said the Officer in page : 202 Command , in a great whisper which sounded like the sea on the shingles in a storm .
`` Hush-sh-sh !
be careful not to wake any one .
Get up , and come to prison . ''
Daffodil objected  but the Officer in Command showed her his warrant from the Queen , and explained to her that he should have to carry her away by force if she did not obey .
`` And we must be very quiet , '' said he  `` for the Queen does not want any one to know . ''
`` Oh , as to that , '' replied Daffodil , `` if the Queen chooses to be so disobliging as to have me waked out of my sleep and sent to prison without consulting me , I do n't see why I should oblige her by making no disturbance .
Besides , '' she added , with the dignity of a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , `` I require the assistance of some of my attendants . ''
`` Any one Your Majest - I mean Your Pre-eminence disturbs and makes aware of your being a prisoner will have to go to prison too , and , to insure silence , for life , '' said the Officer in Command .
He spoke with decision , but with a deference which was reassuring , though she did not like the slip by which he had nearly called her Your Majesty .
It looked as if he might be expecting her to become Queen of Grachidichika , in spite of her being sent to prison .
But she was determined nothing that could be done to her should frighten her into consenting to that .
As to going to prison , however , she saw it was best to yield with a good grace  so she told the Officer in Command she would get up at once and would give him no trouble .
`` You will tell me what is going to be done with page : 203 me , wo n't you ? ''
said the prisoner , as she accepted the arm of the Officer in Command and passed into the corridor which led from her apartments .
`` We can not talk till I have Your Maj - I mean Your Pre-eminence in safety , '' was all the answer .
The Lieutenant of the State Prison was waiting to receive her .
He hopped round three times , but did not speak .
Daffodil wished to return his salutation with equal courtesy to his own  but , when she began the third round , he stopped her by a deprecating gesture and another series of hops , exclaiming `` Nay , Your Maje - Pre-eminence , I can not presume to accept so much condescension . ''
When she had been escorted to her former rooms in the prison , the Officer in Command with respectful hops , took leave of her , adding significantly `` It will not be for long .
I am to be Your Majes - Your - Your - your escort on the occasion . ''
`` Oh , do stay a moment , '' cried Daffodil .
`` You know you were to tell me what is going to be done with me now I am here . ''
`` A Croäxaxican soldier is bound not to reveal his Sovereign 's secrets , '' replied the Officer in Command .
`` But , on this occasion , military honour does not forbid my revealing the exact truth .
I know nothing on the subject . ''
`` But do stop a moment , '' she said urgently .
`` Tell me , at any rate , why you keep almost calling me Your Majesty . ''
`` The respectful zeal of my tongue causes it to be tempted to the slip of giving you your rightful title too soon , '' he replied  `` that is all , Your M - Preeminence . ''
page : 204 `` But it is not my rightful title .
It never will be . ''
`` It will be , the day after to-morrow , '' said the Officer in Command .
With these words he withdrew before she could stop him again .
`` The day after to-morrow ? ''
said she to the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` What does he mean ? ''
`` That is the time fixed for your marriage , Your M - Pre-eminent Madam , '' answered the Lieutenant .
`` What foolish nonsense ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil .
`` The idea of fixing my marriage day when I have not the slightest intention of being married !
How can the Queen be so ridiculous ? ''
`` Permit me to remark , with the fearless loyalty of an inimitable Croäxaxican , that my Queen is not ridiculous , '' said the Lieutenant of the State Prison , with asperity .
`` And I must remind you that your intention can not make the slightest difference to your marriage . ''
`` It can prevent my marriage , '' said Daffodil doggedly .
`` I ask Your Maj - Your present Pre-eminence 's pardon , '' said the Lieutenant , with some difficulty checking a smile of amusement at her fancied independence : `` that is exactly what it can not . ''
`` I will resist for ever ! ''
she replied energetically .
`` That could make no practical difference , '' was the quiet answer .
`` And it would be a pity for it would start you badly in your relation to the Sovereigns of Croäxaxica , as well as , perhaps , to your husband , King Grenoulcrawk .
But I am transgressing  I was forbidden to discourse with Your Majest - Royal Bridality . ''
page : 205 `` Well , you had better let Her Majesty know my determination , '' said Daffodil , trying to keep up the appearance of a confidence that was beginning to desert her .
But the Lieutenant of the State Prison only replied by an irrepressible smile and the ceremonial hops preparatory to his departure .
`` Do n't go hopping at me as if I were a Queen , I tell you , '' she called out to him snappishly .
The Lieutenant of the State Prison stopped his hopping so suddenly that he almost lost his balance .
`` I obey Your Majesty , '' he said with courtly deference , and departed with an obedient celerity which made Daffodil ashamed of her rudeness .
And there was something about this prompt breaking of his salutation , even more than in the salutation itself , that struck into her heart the unwelcome conviction that she was stamped irrevocably Queen Consort of Grachidichika .
page : 206 CHAPTER XVI .
DAFFODIL went to bed in her prison that melancholy night , because there was nothing else to do and she thought it would be wise to try to keep herself strong and fresh for whatever events she might have to meet next day , but , as may easily be understood , excitement and apprehension kept her long waking and made her slumbers broken and feverish .
At length , however , she slept long enough to have a quiet dream and , for the first time since she had been in Croäxaxica , she dreamt of her former home .
She seemed to be swimming pleasantly in the river with the black dog and the white cat , who were telling her anecdotes of their infancy and contradicting each other 's stories .
Presently the river , of its own accord , altered its course and took them to the door of her parent 's house , where Keziah was sitting on the doorstep , shelling peas , in company with a girl in a dress of fish 's scales shining with rainbow colours in the sun , whom she introduced to Daffodil as one of the river-people young ladies come to spend the day .
Then she seemed to have gone upstairs and to be showing her father and mother a lovely green and lilac caterpillar and asking them page : 207 how long it would take to turn into a butterfly , and her father was nodding his head and saying `` It will depend on yourself . ''
A plashing in the water awoke her just then - it was the guard at the door of her apartment being relieved , and she knew the day was beginning .
But she felt pleased at having remembered in her sleep , and she was soothed : she lay still and tried to begin the dream again , and , though she did not succeed in that , she had a good refreshing sleep .
It was long past her usual hour of rising when she awoke again , but her sleep had done her so much good that it was not lost time .
Her dream too , which in a different sort of climate might have started in her mind a train of too vivid memories and longings , in dispiriting contrast with the realities of her present position , remained with her as a quieting pleasure , like a sweet tune lately listened to that keeps coming into one 's ears .
And it left her an odd encouragement : the observation `` It will depend on yourself , '' did not seem particularly practical and convincing , on reflection , as an account of the prospects of the caterpillar in the dream , and , alas !
was but little applicable to her own prospects awake , of which the alarming point was that they were not to be allowed to depend in the least on herself  and yet she found it coming over and over again into her mind and raising her spirits surprisingly .
She found herself singing it and whispering it , as if it were a charm to bring better luck .
`` I wonder why I keep repeating that , '' she said to herself , at last .
`` It 's just what is n't true  for it all depends on the Queen .
However , I must try page : 208 something , if it is only to keep from crying again as I did last night . ''
The only thing she could think of was a supplicating letter to the Queen , and she knew there was little hope from that .
But she asked the gaoler who took away her breakfast to carry a message requesting an interview with the Lieutenant of the State Prison , and , when that officer came , deferential as last night , she prevailed upon him to allow her writing material and to consent to request the Queen 's permission to have the missive delivered to her .
He did not yield to the wishes of his prisoner without hesitation  but she urged that his refusing her would be deciding on a matter concerning which the Queen had not expressed her intention , and the argument prevailed .
She gave much thought to the composition of her letter , in order to avoid saying anything which could hurt the Queen 's feelings or seem disloyal or irreverent to anybody or anything .
Remembering the conversation of the poor Queen of Grachidichika , it now struck her that she ought to have been more tender in her refusal of a suitor once a loss for Queen Raucacoäxine herself - who could not , therefore , but be sensitive about a disparaging rejection of him and his Crown .
She recognised , too , her indiscreetness in taking upon herself , on the spur of the moment , to propose changes in the legislation of the Kingdom , and then her rashness and offence against decorum in thrusting upon the Queen her volunteer arguments against Her cherished scheme for Her son 's marriage .
What she now urged was her own unsuitability to be the wife of a person page : 209 whose habits she did not understand , and to take the management of his household affairs and kingdom .
She ventured , however , to plead , with all the pathos she could , the unhappiness she should feel in a union for which she was so ill adapted , and to implore Her Majesty to spare her .
And she humbly suggested that , if it was considered that her being put in charge of the King of Grachidichika could prolong his life and serve Croäxaxica and that Royal House from which she had received so many favours , she should be allowed to be merely his governess or his nurse .
An hour or so after this appeal had been despatched , Daffodil was joyfully surprised by the announcement that Her Grandeur the Private Under-Princess was asking to see her , and had the Queen 's permission .
Of course she readily consented to receive her visitor .
Croässaquagha , it proved , had not come merely by the Queen 's permission , but by Her desire , although she was not to be considered as bearing any message from Her Majesty , who could on no account so far condescend to an offender who had not yet made unlimited submission .
`` I am bound to the strictest secrecy , '' said Croässaquagha .
`` Nobody else has been allowed to know what has become of you .
There was a great commotion when you were missed , but the Queen had it given out that she knew all about it and that it would be seen in a few days that you had gone to a wonderful advancement , and that , of course , has set curiosity at rest .
But she was so much pleased with your letter that she sent for me privately and confided your address to me that I might come to you about it . ''
page : 210 `` What is her answer ? ''
asked Daffodil , eagerly .
`` She does not make any answer at all .
She can not take any notice of you .
But I may tell you what I know .
She does not think badly of you , now she sees that it is timidity caused by a sense of your drawbacks from natural inferiority that has unsettled your mind and led you to the excess of hesitating about your obedience in the matter .
But she expects absolute compliance , and , as to your being governess or nurse instead of Queen , you can not possibly do what would be derogatory to the dignity of the office of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica , and the King of Grachidichika can not be put under the superintendence of any one less than his Queen .
Besides , the Head Royal Physician and the Ambassador have been hard at work bringing him to want to marry you , and he would get into an alarming state if he did not have his own way now he is bent on it .
So you will be married to-morrow . ''
Daffodil protested  but the Private Under-Princess explained to her that she had no escape : she would be taken to Grachidichika still a prisoner , secretly , at four in the morning , and the first and , as to law , sole essential , marriage ceremony would begin at once .
If necessary to keep her quiet , she would be manacled , and even gagged  but that would only be for peace 's sake , as no opposition she made would have the slightest effect in delaying the marriage , or in making it invalid .
In order to get it through quickly , not only was each of the nine days ' solemnisations due for a Prince 's marriage to be condensed and expedited so as to make it only the five minutes ' length usual on the last day of the nine , but as , by an arrange - page : 211 ment for which there were one or two precedents in the history of Grachidichika , the wedding days could be measured in an exceptional manner , instead of by the usual number of hours , the days to elapse during the marriage were to be each but of fifteen minutes - giving just comfortable time for the procession from and to the Royal Palace , and the marriage service , each day .
The marriage celebrations , including King Grenoulcrawk 's abdication at the commencement and Brekekex 's abdication at the end , would be completed before most people had finished getting up .
`` Then there is no escape ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil , bursting into tears .
But presently , while her friend was trying to soothe her by telling her of the coronation , which would take place a week after the marriage , publicly , and with parade enough to make up for the hurry and privacy of the marriage , a thought struck her which seemed at least to give promise of delay .
`` They 'll be forced to let me wait , '' she said , cheering up .
`` There is n't a white water-lily in flower , and not a bud that can come out big enough for me to get into , whatever is done to bring it on . ''
But Croässaquagha destroyed the hope as soon as it was spoken .
`` That does not affect your wedding .
The white lily has nothing to do with Grachidichikan alliances .
And , as you are not of the Croäxaxican Royal House , not only it is not necessary for the legality of your marriage to a member of the Grachidichikan House , but you are not allowed to assume it .
White flowers of any other sort are proper for your bridal dress  and the Queen has selected page : 212 some splendid campanulas .
to be ready for you tomorrow . ''
`` Is it all so settled as that ? ''
gasped Daffodil , her dismay now complete .
That this preparation should have been made impressed her with the feeling that she was indeed a bride .
`` All is settled past undoing , '' replied Croässaquagha .
`` And now cheer up , dear .
Let us plan your dress for your Soirée Of Honour after your coronation . ''
Daffodil preferred the consolation of complaining of her fate .
The only bit of brightness about her prospect was , she declared , that the horrid old idiot who was to be her husband would be sure very soon to throw a chair at her head and kill her , as he did poor Chachareraroncaxa , and she should be out of it all .
But Croässaquagha insisted against this discontented view .
She dwelt on the sublimity of being a Queen , on the undisturbed opportunities the Queen of Grachidichika could have for living with Art and her soul , on the wonderful wardrobe reported to possess such treasures even in its uncultured state , and of which Daffodil herself had given her a description that made her feel that an artist 's genius could feed on its fantastic combinations hour after hour and day after day .
`` Precautions could be taken , '' she said , `` against the King , your husband 's , getting at anything very heavy to throw in his fun .
And , besides , he is growing weaker so fast that he soon will not be apt to try anything fatiguing .
And surely your soaring spirit can not set a little hurt or annoyance from your husband against the ecstasies of pride as a Queen and composure as an artist which await you in Grachidichika . ''
page : 213 Daffodil sprang to her feet .
`` I have thought of something .
Do you really mean that you think it would be nice to be Queen of Grachidichika , Croässaquagha ? ''
`` Can you doubt it ?
To inferior natures the sacred solitude of Grachidichika might seem a little tedious , even amid the inspiring consciousness of one 's own Royalty , but to my rapt mind there would be , not solitude , but a countless crowd  for the solitude would have my genius for its populace .
Surely you too must feel that , for the untrammelled essence of the artist 's soul , there can be no higher destiny than to be Queen of Grachidichika . ''
`` I daresay you are right , '' said Daffodil : `` and so , since you would like it so much , why should n't you become Queen of Grachidichika ? ''
`` Daffodil !
What !
Have you indeed divined my secret yearning - or rather regret - for an impossibility ?
But it could never be .
I am not even legally eligible . ''
`` Why not , '' replied Daffodil , `` if I am ? ''
`` The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary is allowed in cases where there is no one of Royal blood possible for a wife , but she is the lowest admissible candidate .
And I am not Dressmaker Plenipotentiary . ''
`` But you have been  and that ought to do , '' returned Daffodil .
`` And , besides , '' she added thoughtfully `` I do n't see that they are keeping so very strictly to the rules .
There are the six Princesses being left out . ''
`` You must be very particular , if you call it breaking the rules not to insist on his marrying his six sisters , '' said Croässaquagha .
page : 214 `` Oh , I see , '' said Daffodil , enlightened .
`` You mean Prince Brekekex .
Would you like to marry him ? ''
`` Who would n't ? ''
said Croässaquagha , laughing .
`` Why , you look as thoughtful as if you were putting the question in earnest .
Of course I should like to marry Prince Brekekex , if it were possible : and so would you . ''
`` He is much nicer than that King Grenoulcrawk , certainly , '' said Daffodil .
`` A hundred times nicer , for anybody he quite suited .
But I am afraid it was only Grenoulcrawk that I thought we could manage with for you to be Queen of Grachidichika . ''
`` But that too is impossible , '' said Croässaquagha , mournfully .
`` I do n't think the Queen is so very particular about him , if she can only get the rules to seem to be kept , '' argued Daffodil  `` or else she would not be taking me for him and having all that abdicating to fit me in .
She could easily make out that your position was the same for him as if you were still Dressmaker Plenipotentiary - or she could make out something from your having the title of Princess - '' `` Under-Princess , '' interpolated Croässaquagha .
`` Well , he is a very under sort of King , '' said Daffodil .
`` I do n't know about that , '' said the Private Under-Princess , rather scandalised at Daffodil 's irreverence .
`` He is King Regnant of the Matrimonial State of Grachidichika  and his wife will be the greatest Queen in the world next to Queen Raucacoäxine . ''
`` Well , anyhow the Queen could easily find some page : 215 way of getting rid of your tiny bit of ineligibility , as it is so very tiny .
Why , she could let you abdicate the Private and the Under for the wedding , or he could abdicate himself into a Private Under Prince for the occasion . ''
`` I believe you are right as to the legal possibilities , '' said Croässaquagha , thoughtfully .
`` And do n't you think that the Queen would rather it were you than I , when she saw it could be ?
You see I am a foreigner and do n't understand the ways , and you would make such a much better Queen of Grachidichika .
And then she ca n't really like making me marry bound and gagged . ''
`` Yes , she would prefer it , I think , in itself , '' said Croässaquagha  `` but her heart is set now on Guachapeara becoming Dressmaker Plenipotentiary . ''
`` That 's easy , '' Daffodil replied cheerfully .
`` I 'll resign at once . ''
`` You can not .
I resigned for you  you can not for Guachapeara . ''
`` Why not ?
I 'd resign for anybody the Queen liked . ''
`` Even if you are willing to make such a sacrifice of your position and your fame , '' replied the Under-Princess , `` the Queen could not permit it .
It would be a scandal .
I am the only Dressmaker Plenipotentiary who ever vacated the office , except by death - natural death , or in the Boa Constrictor 's mouth for treason , as has happened thrice in the history of Croäxaxica .
Your unprecedented style of genius - a genius that can bear the clog of having to execute its conceptions for the vulgar eye to perceive - was fit reason for my unprecedented course .
page : 216 But it would be ridiculous for you to imitate my example for Guachapeara , and it would make her ridiculous - and the thing that no inimitable Croäxaxican can be allowed to be is to be ridiculous . ''
`` Then I will resign in your favour .
That will make you eligible for the marriage without any more trouble .
Then , as soon as you are married , the office will be vacant and Princess Guachapeara can have it . ''
`` It is impossible .
You do n't even yet understand the immutability with which the reverence of ages surrounds your office .
How can you resign it for me who have already surrendered it to you on the ground of your better fitness for it ?
No : as long as you exist , neither I nor Guachapeara can be Dressmaker Plenipotentiary - unless , of course , your elevation to the throne of Grachidichika removes you . ''
`` I seem terribly in the way , '' said Daffodil .
`` And I am in my own way worst of all . ''
`` I told you you could not alter anything , '' said Croässaquagha .
`` You had much better not fidget about it any more .
Fate has decreed you a high and soul-inspiring destiny : accept it , for you are worthy of it . ''
`` I feel quite sure the Queen and Guachapeara herself would n't think it made her ridiculous , '' said Daffodil returning to her theme after her momentary despair .
`` And I could have some name given me that would allow me to do all the inventing for her quietly and keep her from making blunders . ''
Croässaquagha gazed at her with surprise and admiration .
`` All obstacles disappear before your commanding intellect , your invincible will .
Yes , page : 217 this mighty scheme can be carried out , and I may be Queen of Grachidichika .
But let me think .
For one thing , can I consent to supplant yourself on the throne ? ''
`` I shall be so much obliged to you , if you will , '' said Daffodil .
Croässaquagha sat for a few minutes absorbed in thought .
Then she gave a sudden `` Oh ! ''
`` What is it ? ''
cried Daffodil .
`` Have you hurt yourself ? ''
`` The Workhouse ! ''
said Croässaquagha .
`` We were forgetting the Workhouse . ''
`` No we were n't '' said Daffodil .
`` We talked about that at the beginning , and I told you that was n't the part I minded . ''
`` You did , you did .
But in our picturings of the joys of the Queen of Grachidichika , even as the wife of Grenoulcrawk and not Brekekex , I had forgotten that the Workhouse for Failures awaited Grenoulcrawk 's wife , and that soon . ''
`` I should say the Workhouse was the best part of it . ''
`` I know you do , strange being .
The coarse fare , the mushrooms and the unflavoured water , you make your chosen diet in a palace .
You dispense with our luxuries  you - you even like work . ''
`` I like some of the work you say they do in the Workhouse for Failures , '' Daffodil said .
`` I should like to make the coloured waters , and I should not mind plaiting lattice-work .
I do n't think I should like teasing bog cotton , nor yet making mud - but anything would seem better than being with that Grenoulcrawk for a husband . ''
page : 218 `` I must believe you , though I can not understand you `` replied the Private Under-Princess .
`` For you , then , the workhouse has no terrors .
But for me , born in splendours , nursed in luxury , revered , beloved , admired , for me to endure the privations and drudgery of the poverty-stricken receptacle for failures , for me , ME , to be classed as a failure - '' she paused horror-struck , then , clasping her hands , she exclaimed .
`` Daffodil , for pity 's sake do not give the Queen a hint even of the scheme you have entertained .
She would jump at the notion .
Nothing could save me . ''
`` Could n't I say you would n't have the King at all if you were to have to go to the Workhouse after , and that the Queen must consider herself bound in honour not to act upon my plan at all unless she would accept the condition and get you abdicated , or something , out of that rule ? ''
was Daffodil 's next suggestion .
But Croässaquagha felt no confidence in the Queen 's considering herself bound by any such stipulation , and was in a great fright .
`` If she once gets a glimmering of your plan , she will insist on it , whatever becomes of me .
It would suit her so capitally  because you could be kept to do all Guachapeara 's inventing for her and make her famous . ''
`` I must think of something else , '' sighed Daffodil , wearily .
She would not give the answer Croässaquagha was to ask for the Queen as to her behaviour on the morrow .
`` I wo n't say what I 'll do , till I have had a good while to think by myself , '' she declared resolutely .
`` And , if that answer does make page : 219 the Queen more angry , I ca n't help it .
She can not possibly punish me worse than by marrying me the way she is going to do . ''
She consented , however , to send a respectful message to the effect that she would be prepared to state her intention later , if Her Majesty required her to do so .
`` And I do hope your answer will be that you will go and be married quietly , '' said the Private Under-Princess , as she took leave , `` You see it does not in the least depend upon you whether you are married or not , but it does depend upon you whether it will be done comfortably for you or not . ''
The words sounded disagreeably true .
Daffodil thought for hours , and at the end they only seemed truer .
She resolved to go quietly .
In the evening , a muffled figure entered unannounced .
It was the Queen .
`` Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , '' she said in solemn tones , `` I myself , your Queen , give you a latest opportunity of a return to loyalty and obedience .
You are to be married to-morrow .
Do you go to Grachidichika willingly and thankfully , or do I send you there in shackles ? ''
`` I ca n't go willingly and thankfully , please Your Majesty , '' replied Daffodil , `` because I do so very much hate it .
But , if you wo n't be merciful and let me off , I will go without resistance . ''
`` And smilingly ? ''
asked the Queen , still with some severity in her tone , though evidently beginning to be appeased .
`` I will smile , since your Majesty desires it '' said Daffodil .
page : 220 `` You are a darling ! ''
said the Queen , and she gave her a kiss .
`` I would rather Your Majesty did not do that , '' said Daffodil  `` because I should certainly thwart your wish in this matter if I could . ''
`` You ca n't , '' said the Queen .
`` And all I want of you is that you sha n't make any tiresome fuss .
You promise ? ''
`` Yes '' said Daffodil .
`` Since it is of no use to make a fuss , I wo n't make one . ''
`` Then I still say you are a darling , '' said the Queen , highly pleased , and she kissed her again .
She was now in such good humour that she sat down and entered into conversation , describing pathetically all the troubles she had had while bringing about this marriage .
Matters were now all comfortably settled .
The Regius Professor of Everything , in terrible grief at having forfeited the Queen 's favour , had shut himself up with all his books and with a stack of water-cresses and a ton of mussels to sharpen his wits , determined not to stir out until he had discovered something to assist her in her policy .
The result was that he went , after only three days , to the Crown Prince , able to point out to him that , if the Duke of Happypool were to be made King of Grachidichika , his daughter , as daughter of a reigning King , would not be able to marry the Crown Prince 's eldest son , if the Crown Prince was still Crown Prince when his eldest son was ready for a wife - which was more likely than the opposite contingency , as King Logaplop gave , happily , every promise of living into a hale old age .
The Crown Prince , impressed by this important aspect of page : 221 the case , and glad to have an opportunity of ending the coolness between himself and his mother , went to her and communicated the Professor 's statement , expressing himself willing to withdraw every suggestion of the Duke of Happypool 's being made King Grenoulcrawk 's successor , under existing circumstances , and wholly convinced of the wisdom of Her Majesty 's scheme .
The Queen had received her son 's return to her councils with joy , and the Regius Professor of Everything gained a higher place in her favour than ever .
The Head Royal Physician also had thoroughly atoned for his error : the zeal and skill with which he had calmed King Grenoulcrawk 's feverish fractiousness and assisted the ambassador to make him , not only content to marry Daffodil , but fretting for her arrival , had earned Her Majesty 's highest satisfaction .
The Princesses had been won to forget their dislike to the loss of their favourite companion and helper by its being decided that , as the bridegroom , though he had to be unkinged for just the time of the wedding , was really a King , it would not be unseemly that they should add lustre to the bride 's position by being of her wedding party .
They had left off crying , and were impatient for the eventful morning .
Prince Brekekex alone remained uncheerful .
He approved , indeed , of the Queen 's scheme , as the only practical way to meet so many difficulties  but he was grieved at Daffodil 's unwillingness .
In spite of its being very disagreeable to him to contemplate her permanent absence in Grachidichika and the Workhouse , he would have taken things pleasantly , like everybody else , if the bride had felt the natural pleasure of her position , page : 222 but , now it appeared as if her reluctance were so much in earnest that she must be forced to her wedding like a criminal to execution , he seemed so full of hesitation and compunction that it was feared that , if she persevered in her obstinacy , he might give trouble at the last moment and even have to have his signature put to the abdicating document by force .
`` But now , '' said the Queen , `` all will go delightfully , and I shall not have the vexation of forcing anybody to do anything they object to .
You are really a darling , and I am quite sorry to part with you .
If there were any other way of managing things , I would not do it even now . ''
Daffodil thought of that plan about Croässaquagha which she knew would please the Queen so well , and bit her lip hard not to cry .
But , although she could not free herself from her hated fate by the only means which seemed sure of success , she made one more attempt by a fervent supplication to the Queen to let her off the marriage .
She moved the Queen to tears .
`` I am really very sorry for you , '' said Her Majesty tenderly  `` since you feel your leaving our Court with this sincerity , I wish I had any other person who could fill your place .
But you see what unspeakably important interests depend on your becoming Queen of Grachidichika .
There , now , go to bed early , and get up to-morrow a happy fond smiling bride , as you promised . ''
`` Your Majesty , I only promised to smile , '' said Daffodil .
`` Quite so , '' said the Queen graciously .
`` I am very much pleased with you .
Good-night , your Matri - page : 223 monial Majesty . ''
And off she went , in the height of affability .
Daffodil took Queen Raucacoäxine 's advice and went to bed early  she remembered .
that she was to leave the prison at four , and she wished to be as fresh in mind and body as possible .
`` Whatever is to happen to me , '' she thought , `` I had better keep myself able to do the best I can . ''
She was awakened next morning still earlier than she had expected .
The Queen had ordered that she should secretly be conducted to the Palace .
Her Majesty received her herself .
`` Is n't this nice for you ? ''
she said to her .
`` I did n't like your starting from the prison - and there might be a talk about it if it got known - and , now you are in the proper frame of mind for a bride , you can be dressed in my own room , and start from the Palace with the Royal Party . ''
`` I had rather go this way than bound and gagged , '' replied Daffodil brightly .
And she set about her wedding toilette with alacrity , and thanked the Head Royal Dresspicker and the Head Royal Dressmaker for the pains they must have taken to prepare such a pretty and well-sized bridal costume .
The Queen presented her with a magnificent tiara of toadstools , and there were bracelets and necklaces as wedding presents from every member of the Royal Family and from the Private Under-Princess , whose great wealth had enabled her to send jewels which the Queen herself could scarcely match , and from the Regius Professor and the Head Royal Physician .
Daffodil felt pleased at so much kindness .
page : 224 As the procession , with as much quiet and secrecy as its stateliness allowed , started for Grachidichika , Daffodil could not but observe that she was still closely guarded and that , although everything was done to conceal the fact under the semblance of a reverent attendance upon her , a close watch over her was kept .
However , as she had not dreamed for a moment of breaking her word , she felt no disappointment at these indications of the impossibility of her escape .
She had the honour of being escorted by the Crown Prince , and with him she chatted so agreeably that he was moved to exclaim `` I am really so sorry we are to lose you .
Our Court will be quite dull without you . ''
Prince Brekekex , escorting the Crown Princess , noted the bride 's demeanour , and brightened with her brightness .
`` It is so nice to find you so pleased , '' he took an opportunity of saying to her as they stopped without the Kingdom of Grachidichika , at the tunnel 's mouth , to wait for King Grenoulcrawk , who was to sign his abdication there .
`` I should n't have liked to do my part this morning , if you had been vexed at the marriage still : but it 's all quite enjoyable now . ''
`` And , as you would have to be made to do your part by force , if you refused , I would rather you did it comfortably , '' said Daffodil .
`` It 's the best plan , '' said Prince Brekekex , `` and I am glad you think so .
You remember my lines The valiant heart will never once obey , For , when it must , ` That 's what I will ' ` twill say , Thus always can be having its own way . ''
page : 225 `` That 's just it , '' answered the bride of King Grenoulcrawk .
As she spoke , King Grenoulcrawk 's head appeared peeping out of the tunnel , then disappeared with a jerk , as if he had been pulled back .
Next moment the whole of him was seen , with his arms leaning on the Ambassador and the Head Royal Physician , who seemed much more anxious to continue their support than he to accept it - the fact being that they were afraid of his bouncing into the canal , now they had brought him so temptingly near that opportunity for playing them a trick .
`` Pray make haste , Prince Brekekex , '' cried the Head Royal Physician , there being no time for ceremony  and Brekekex sprang , at one leap , over the heads of the bride and her Royal Bridesmaids , to the edge of the landing-place .
There the King poked into his hand a deed , which Brekekex signed , and which the King was , with some difficulty , got to make a show of signing by just touching the letters of his name .
`` I signed it last night for you , '' he kept declaring , `` and it ca n't have worn out so soon . ''
However , he did what was wanted , and again poked the document into Brekekex 's hand .
Brekekex , thereupon , jumped out of the water , and , the moment he was ashore , on a whisper from the Ambassador , snatched off Grenoulcrawk 's crown and put it on his own head , dragged the sceptre from under Grenoulcrawk 's arm , took the ball which the Head Royal Physician had twitched out of Grenoulcrawk 's pocket ready for him , and ran off into Grachidichika before the dethroned monarch could make an effort to stop him .
page : 226 It is doubtful whether Grenoulcrawk understood the process he had gone through , but at any rate his feeble faculties were unable to comprehend the propriety of somebody else using his crown , sceptre , and ball , and ( and of this he thought still more ) preceding him in the procession .
But , while he was stamping and scolding , the Head Royal Physician , with great presence of mind , exclaimed , as if something unexpected had happened at that moment , `` Hullo !
Here 's the bride !
What an extraordinary creature !
Is n't she lovelily funny ? ''
And , the bridegroom 's attention being thus diverted from his grievance , matters became pleasant again .
The wedding party now landed solemnly , and Daffodil was led to her bridegroom , who received her with enthusiastic delight , turning summersaults and cutting capers in her honour until he was out of breath and could barely totter .
As soon as he was able to lead the procession , it started for the palace whence the ceremonial march to the wedding was to begin .
Etiquette did not allow of his conducting his bride on the way to his Palace  the appearance , hand in hand , of the Royal Bridal Pair , which is a marked portion of the wedding formalities , would have been premature at present , and the Crown Princess of Croäxaxica , the highest lady present , was the proper person for him to escort .
The bride followed with the Crown Prince , surrounded by the Royal Princesses who had condescended to be her bridesmaids .
Grenoulcrawk , though he submitted to this arrangement , was so eager to have the wedding begin and to be able to walk with the wife whom he declared `` just made for page : 227 him , she suited him so well , '' that , as soon as he recovered from his previous exertions , he first tried walking backwards to see her as they followed him , and then , finding that inconvenient , set off running to get to the Palace as fast as possible , pulling his daughter along with him , and compelling the whole company to break out of their dignified pace and scamper along not to lose sight of him .
When they arrived in the Great Throne Hall , they found Brekekex seated on the throne in state , as King of Grachidichika , with nobody with him but the Speaker of the House of Commons , who had been put there to attend on the new monarch .
Only two of the most trusted of the inhabitants had been allowed to know what was going on , and they had to be at the cathedral , ready to receive the Patriarch of Croäxaxica , who had come with the wedding party , and to act as beadles .
There was no permanent Cathedral in Grachidichika , the Royal chapel adjoining the Great Throne Room being more than large enough to accommodate all the inhabitants of the Kingdom , but , for high ceremonials , it was customary to raise in the grounds a temporary building called Cathedral , Hall , or Court , as the occasion required , in order to give space for a procession , and , though the haste and the secrecy of the present event made it impossible to have a construction of the customary size and dignity , it was indispensable to have something to represent the marriage Cathedral , as the bridal procession to it was in itself part of the marriage ceremony .
The assembling of the wedding party in the Great Throne Hall was a matter of necessary etiquette , but it was not intended page : 228 to lose any time in the customary compliments and marshallings .
The wisdom of curtailing this part of the proceedings was the more apparent that Grenoulcrawk manifested considerable perturbation at the sight of the occupier of his throne .
In great haste the bride 's arm was placed in the bridegroom 's by the Crown Prince , and the pair were run and pushed up to the front of the throne to make their reverences to the King of Grachidichika .
`` I greet my dear Royal Kinsfolk and subjects now ratifying their marriage contract .
Come back to me presently husband and wife , '' said Brekekex , in the formula prescribed for such occasions .
If he had been going to the wedding he would have had to say `` I will greet you presently husband and wife , '' instead of `` Come back to me . ''
It had been decided , however , that , although he did not like losing the wedding , he had better remain on the throne , so as to establish distinctly the fact that he , not Grenoulcrawk , had been King of Grachidichika during the marriage of Grenoulcrawk and the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica .
The word `` wife '' was still on Brekekex 's lips , when Daffodil found herself again hustled and dragged forward on Grenoulcrawk 's arm .
Grenoulcrawk , himself , showed a momentary wish to resist .
`` He 's in my throne , '' he grumbled .
`` And he 's got my crown and things , '' but a `` Hold your bride fast , Your Majesty , for fear she should run away , '' from the Head Royal Physician , in a loud whisper of pretended alarm , distracted his attention satisfactorily while the pair were being got out of the Throne Room .
The rest of the party followed as rapidly as their necessary page : 229 salutations to the King on the throne allowed - and such very diminished salutations had never been known before .
Brekekex , though he knew that the irreverence was accidental , and though he was scarcely really a King , was not able to help feeling a little annoyed .
But a consolatory thought struck him .
`` I shall make them all salute me with the full State honours , very slowly , after the marriage , before I abdicate , '' said he to the Speaker when he found himself again alone with that solemn representative of the Grachidichikan nation .
Grenoulcrawk became sedate and cheerful as the procession advanced from the Palace .
He walked looking at Daffodil , and seemed to find enjoyment in her company .
He began conversation , telling her he had not understood why it was n't the Princess Royal of Croäxaxica that was insisting on marrying him , instead of only her , but that he now saw she had been quite right to insist , as he was very much pleased with her and quite agreed with his State advisers that it would not have been proper that any one but himself should have her , since there was not , he understood , any other such a frog as herself in the world .
And he went so far as to stroke her face and call her his fine big doll .
`` If you do that again , I 'll slap you , '' cried Daffodil .
`` That will be fun , '' answered her bridegroom .
`` But we must n't begin to have a game of romps yet  because we must keep quiet till they have done getting us married .
But come along , we 'll go quicker , and then all the fuss will be over sooner and we can do what we like by ourselves .
Hooray ! ''
and he began to prance along double quick .
page : 230 Daffodil felt her heart sink at this exhilaration in her bridegroom .
She had had leisure in the last two or three minutes , in spite of his chatter , to feel that the marriage ceremony had really begun , and she knew that a minute or two more must bring her to the spot for its irrevocable completion .
Although several repetitions of the wedding forms were indispensable for decorum , the first celebration would be final in its binding effect , so that she was even now in the crisis of her fate .
In all probability , thought she , they would find it necessary to hurry and hustle Grenoulcrawk through the ritual in the Cathedral , and she would find herself married before she could make out what was passing .
She wanted all her composure now .
And she especially wanted her bridegroom to be in the cheery quiet from which her threat had aroused him .
With a horrible anxiety in her mind lest she should be too late in getting him calm enough for the attention she required , she set to work to bring him back to a more placid enjoyment of his position .
He relaxed his pace , the idea of romping left him , and he began to chat sedately again .
The rude little edifice , half cellar , half wigwam , which was to be their marriage Cathedral stood a dozen paces in front of them .
There was no time to be lost .
`` Do look at my funny nose-knob , '' said Daffodil .
Grenoulcrawk gazed at the protuberance , he stopped to gaze better , and turned to face her .
On the moment , she moved to go on , and trod with all her might on his feet !
With a loud howl , the injured bridegroom sprang over the ground , ten feet at a time , and plunged into page : 231 the nearest guggle-ooze beds .
In vain was he pursued , in vain was he even overtaken , go near the bride he would not .
His agitation whenever he was brought near her became so tremendous that the Head Royal Physician , although in agonies of apprehension lest Queen Raucacoäxine should misapprehend his motives , was forced to inform the Crown Prince that , if the attempt to reconcile the enraged and terrified bridegroom was persisted in , his life would be the price , as he had already had three fits , besides wearing himself faint with screaming .
And , whenever Grenoulcrawk was not faint or in a fit , he was using his skill in throwing all sorts of heavy things at the wedding party , more especially at the Crown Prince .
The Crown Prince agreed that they must go as fast as they could , taking the unlucky bride with them .
In the hurry to leave Grachidichika , Brekekex was almost forgotten .
Daffodil remembered him when she caught sight of Grenoulcrawk running slily to the Palace with the Patriarch 's seat from the Cathedral on his head .
Pointing him out with a cry of warning to those around her , she ran to the Palace , and , as the rest , though quicker runners than she , were slower in perceiving the need for haste , she reached the Throne Hall first .
Just as she was telling Brekekex why he must come away at once , Grenoulcrawk rushed in , shouting `` Now I 'll have my throne and crown and things , '' and was about to hurl his missile .
But , suddenly , seeing Daffodil , he gave a shriek of alarm , and fled .
Brekekex , on his side , lost no time , before shouting `` I abdicate , I abdicate . ''
He dashed the crown , the page : 232 sceptre , and the ball on the floor , and , rushing to the Speaker , threw into his lap the deed of abdication he had signed , ready for the proper moment , to pass the time while he was sitting on the throne with nothing to do .
Then , hand in hand with Daffodil , whom he felt to be a sure protector against King Grenoulcrawk , he ran to the road out of Grachidichika , and met the contingent of the discomfited wedding party who had had the courage and energy to come to seek him - chiefly consisting of his youngest sisters , whose childish rashness experience had not yet controlled .
`` We must hasten to inform Her Majesty of the surprising change of mind of the King of Grachidichika , '' said the Crown Prince , with resentful dignity .
And thereupon he took to his heels , and , everybody following his example , the wedding party speedily arrived in Croäxaxica .
page : 233 CHAPTER XVII .
THE wedding party returned to Queen Raucacoäxine in much trepidation .
No one could feel sure that she would not be angry with him , or with her , for not having done something to prevent the catastrophe or to retrieve it , and there was in every one 's mind both vexation at Daffodil for her , as they considered , clumsy misadventure , and friendly apprehension , on her account , of the form Her Majesty 's indignation might take .
But , to the general surprise , Her Majesty , though terribly disappointed at the rupture of the marriage on which so much depended and which she had planned so carefully in every detail that it had seemed impossible anything could hinder it , showed no indignation at all - excepting indeed against King Grenoulcrawk , whose perfidy in refusing to fulfil his engagement would , she said , be properly punished by an armed invasion of his territory , if it were not that his deposition was undesirable while Prince Brekekex was unmarried .
She even showed displeasure when blame was thrown on Daffodil : she did not see , she said , that treading on a person who got himself under your feet was an offence page : 234 against the law of nations , or against decorum , or even against natural grace and elegance .
In fact it was evident that it would be just a lady of the highest refinement and dignity who would tumble over Grenoulcrawk .
All her hearers , except Daffodil , were considerably perplexed by this view of the case  but they thought it consolatory .
And it may well be imagined that Daffodil was greatly relieved by Her Majesty 's favourable expressions .
But , unhappily , Her Majesty 's leniency towards the culprit could not remove the serious political consequences of the act .
Who was now to take wifely charge of King Grenoulcrawk and prolong his life by her guidance , obedience , amusingness , scoldings , so that he might not fulfil his apparent destiny and follow his former Queen before Brekekex 's intended wife had got born ?
Attempts were made to bring the injured monarch to think with equanimity of continuing the marriage ceremony which had been so woefully disturbed : but , as Queen Raucacoäxine had too surely foreboded to her counsellors , while directing them to try all endeavours imaginable to prevail upon him , all endeavours failed .
The results were even harmful : King Grenoulcrawk had been all the better in health and serenity for the excitement he had undergone  instead of injuring him , as had naturally been apprehended , it seemed to have acted as a stimulating tonic to his mental and bodily faculties , and he became better than he had been since he had begun to miss his wife .
But the alarm raised in his mind by the proposal of bringing him again in contact with the being who had crushed his toes , and the fatigue of under - page : 235 going so many arguments and persuasions , soon exhausted and enfeebled him , and he would do nothing but weep and moan over his lost Chachareraroncaxa , his dear old Queen that would n't have let them bring him any wretch to tread on him .
It was evident that all thought of making Daffodil Grenoulcrawk 's Queen must be abandoned , and that he must be reassured on that head as soon as possible .
The resolution was fortunately taken in time , and the sufferer , when he became really convinced that he was to see Daffodil no more , began to revive .
And now the desperate idea of sacrificing the Princess Royal of Croäxaxica to the Workhouse for Failures began to press on the Queen 's mind .
She even went so far as to have the suggestion of this alliance made to Grenoulcrawk .
But Grenoulcrawk , who had had his doll given back to him and who , in her society , was recovering somewhat of his natural gaiety , felt the shock of a proposal for yet another marriage so severely that he collapsed and was with difficulty recovered .
The Head Royal Physician had no choice but to tell Queen Raucacoäxine that any further effort to prolong the King of Grachidichika 's life by providing him with a consort would make an end of him .
The Head Royal Physician had fortunately so thoroughly satisfied Raucacoäxine by his recent services that she felt no anger against him at this grievous communication , and merely listened with the calm of despair .
The King of Croäxaxica , himself , was aroused by the state of affairs .
He said `` If Brekekex ca n't get married before King Grenoulcrawk requires a page : 236 successor , we shall have to let Happypool be King of Grachidichika . ''
`` Never ! ''
exclaimed Queen Raucacoäxine , clasping her hands .
One night the Private Under-Princess requested an interview with the Queen , alone .
She looked grave and embarrassed .
`` Your Majesty , '' she faltered , `` my beloved and venerated Queen , I have something to break to you - something terrible . ''
`` Go on , '' said the Queen , gasping but courageous .
`` I am distressed that it is my voice that has to tell you a harsh and irrepressible truth , '' Croässaquagha said apologetically .
`` But loyalty forbids my keeping anything disagreeable from Your Majesty .
And , lowly though I be , I love the Royal Family .
And the soul of genius abhors keeping a secret . ''
`` You are quite right , my dear Private Under-Princess , '' replied the Queen  `` secrets kept from me are disagreeable .
Go on , reveal the worst . ''
`` Your Majesty , my attendant , Seventy Seven And A Half , one of our Under Royal Wardrobe-maids , is a great gossip . ''
`` That is terrible , '' said the Queen .
`` But I can bear it . ''
`` But Your Majesty - '' `` Never mind the particulars , '' interrupted the Queen .
`` My head and heart are weary already with particulars .
This Grachidichikan difficulty is interminable .
I trust your general statement on the subject : the only question is how to deal with the offender .
I am informed that there arc two vacancies on the Grachidichikan Household staff : why should we not recommend her for one ? ''
page : 237 `` But , Your Majesty , '' said the Private Under-Princess , `` That is not all .
It is something quite different I have to say . ''
`` Then why did you say that ? ''
said the Queen .
`` Your Majesty knows , '' said Croässaquagha , going on with her story , `` how little likely my mind is to seek tittle-tattle for its food .
I do not permit Seventy Seven And A Half to break my repose with the results of her widespread researches into domestic events .
But this morning she touched on a subject which aroused my attention , and , as a duty to my Sovereigns and country , I invited information .
I learned that , although betrothed to an attendant of the King of Grachidichika , she has lately , for want of his society , permitted the attentions of a servant of the Duke of Happypool . ''
`` She shall be dismissed at once , without a character , '' said the Queen .
`` What business has an Under Royal Wardrobe-maid to keep company with a person of that disgusting kind ? ''
`` Of course I reproved her , Your Majesty .
But - '' `` Oh do n't tell me any more about the unworthy creature , '' broke in the Queen .
`` Write me out an order to the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to dismiss her , and I 'll sign it at once . ''
`` But , Your Majesty , I have not come to the secret , '' said the Private Under-Princess .
`` If you know any worse of her , she must be fit for hanging , '' said the Queen .
`` The companion of her holiday hours , '' resumed the Private Under-Princess , `` is the oldest and most confidential servant of the Happypool family - one page : 238 who looks on the Duke as a son and would sacrifice anything to the advancement of his interests , which he feels to be his own .
Of course he is trusted with every secret of the house , great or small , and Seventy Seven And A Half may be relied on for having accurate information . ''
`` Ah ! ''
said the Queen `` I wo n't dismiss her .
It 'll serve Happypool right to have all his private affairs gossiped about , and I am not bound to dismiss a valuable servant to protect him from a little annoyance . ''
Croässaquagha continued , `` Struck by what she said , I at once gave her leave to go to meadow-sweet this afternoon at the Duke 's with her admirer - an entertainment not unfamiliar to her - and to bring him to supper in my house - an entertainment , I have reason to believe , not unfamiliar to him .
The result is that I have just learned from Seventy Seven And A Half the treachery I come to reveal .
Madam , that baby you meant to be born - the wife for Prince Brekekex - something has happened to her .
Her existence had been nipped before you had begun to intend her to exist . ''
She paused : but the Queen was speechless with curiosity and surprise .
The narrator continued `` At the time of the death of Queen Chachareraroncaxa , Madam , the Duke of Happypool perceived , like yourself , the difficulties in the way of Prince Brekekex 's succession .
He resolved that , if he should have a daughter , he would hide her away till King Grenoulcrawk died and thus keep himself a good chance of being called to the throne , from Prince Brekekex 's page : 239 not being able to get a wife in time .
So when she was born - '' `` What ! ''
exclaimed Raucacoäxine `` born !
The baby I was thinking of really born already ! ''
`` The day before yesterday , '' said the Private Under-Princess .
`` And I thought we should have months to wait ! ''
cried the Queen in a transport of joy .
And she rushed into the adjacent room in which she had left her two sons , her two eldest daughters , the Professor of Everything , and the Head Royal Physician , who had all of them , according to the present melancholy custom , been talking over everything with her when the Private Under-Princess arrived .
`` Triumph !
Victory !
Success ! ''
shouted Her Majesty .
`` Hear , hear the news .
Happypool 's second child was born the day before yesterday in a mystery .
Brekekex 's wife is at hand already ! ''
The acclamations with which this communication was received were perfectly riotous .
Only , Brekekex added regretfully , `` I wish she could have been born a little more grown up .
A baby seems a difficult sort of wife to manage . ''
`` Never mind .
It will grow up nicely by and by in Grachidichika , '' said the Queen encouragingly .
`` The thing is to marry it at once and be safe , whatever happens to Grenoulcrawk .
But I think we must only have quite a quiet wedding now .
And then we can have some grand celebration in a few years ' time when she is older . ''
They discussed these wedding arrangements for a while , and then Her Majesty , whose good humour at the unexpected possession of a bride at once for page : 240 Prince Brekekex had kept resentment at its father 's intention of hiding it out of her mind , bethought herself of mentioning the treachery which he had intended .
`` There is nothing for it , however , '' she said , `` but to seem not to understand anything but that he wanted to give us a pleasant surprise  for the only other alternative would be to punish his treason by the Boa Constrictor , and then Brekekex could not marry the baby after all , and Zumbarzabulixine would have to give up her husband that is growing up for her , and none could be born for Guachapeara and the others . ''
Meanwhile the Private Under-Princess had been left alone in the room in which she had had an interview with the Queen .
She waited for some time expecting that Her Majesty would return to her , or that she should be called .
At last , finding that she was forgotten , and feeling the necessity of putting Her Majesty in possession of all the facts before any course of action was irrevocably decided , she appeared , unsummoned , among the rejoicing party .
`` Forgive my intrusion , Your Majesty , '' she said .
`` But my story is not done . ''
`` Good gracious ! ''
said the Queen .
`` Well , do get on with it .
You had got to the Duke of Happypool 's daughter being born the day before yesterday . ''
`` I had , Your Majesty .
And here comes the fatal part of the narrative .
When she was born , it turned out that she was a son . ''
One mighty groan arose simultaneously and filled the air with a roar .
It was some time before any of Croässaquagha 's hearers could speak .
page : 241 `` The infant traitor shall pay for his crime with his life , '' said the Queen , at last .
`` Why , no , that wo n't do , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` We shall want him for a husband . ''
`` Yes , to be sure he will be of some use , '' said the Queen , brightening up a little .
`` Appalling as this catastrophe is , there is comfort in that . ''
`` My story has to be concluded , '' said the Private Under-Princess , `` May I go on ? ''
`` For goodness sake , go on and come to the end , '' replied Her Majesty .
`` She has ceased to live , '' said the Private Under-Princess .
`` Whether because she found she was a son instead of the daughter required by Your Majesty , Prince Brekekex , Croäxaxica , and Grachidichika , or whether from constitutional moroseness , she did nothing but cry .
The nurse imprudently gave her mussels to quiet her  they disagreed with her , and , in fact , choked her . ''
`` But , if it was not a daughter after all , why has Happypool gone on making a secret of it ? ''
asked the Queen .
`` Brekekex could n't have it for his wife if it was a boy and died . ''
`` He thinks , as he might incur suspicion for the concealment that has been practised , that , the child being dead , he may as well keep the whole matter secret still , '' answered Croässaquagha .
`` And also he is desirous of your continuing to lose time in waiting for his daughter for Prince Brekekex . ''
`` My bride is dead , My throne has fled , I 'll go to bed . ''
said poor Brekekex ruefully .
Verse soothed his feelings .
page : 242 `` Stop , '' said the Queen .
`` Nobody can go to bed now .
We must devise something to baffle that atrocious conspirator . ''
But nobody could devise anything to get Brekekex a wife , which was the great point .
They were at last about to break up their midnight council in despair , when Croässaquagha said timidly , but with resolution , `` Let it be allowed to my insignificance to give vent to a daring proposal which has been in my mind . ''
`` Pray do , '' said everybody , with enthusiasm .
`` Your Majesty , illustrious Princes and Princesses , and Regius Professor of Everything , and Royal Head Physician , '' said the Private Under-Princess , `` My weak mind has been inspired with the scheme that can make Prince Brekekex 's future crown secure and give him a Queen to take with him to Grachidichika when he gets it .
But , ere I speak , let me hear from the Head Royal Physician whether I have understood him rightly that King Grenoulcrawk can not live till another baby is born for Prince Brekekex in place of the one who has gone wrong . ''
`` I can only repeat what I have already had the honour of regretfully stating to Her Majesty so many times this evening , '' said the Head Royal Physician .
`` It is wholly impossible . ''
`` Then , hear me , all , '' said Croässaquagha , and became silent .
Everybody felt sure she was going to say something , but could not think what it could be .
`` Let Prince Brekekex marry Daffodil , the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica . ''
There was a pause .
The proposal was so sudden page : 243 that all needed time to recover from the shock .
Then `` He ca n't . ''
`` He can . ''
`` It is within the law . ''
`` Such a thing was never heard of ! ''
`` Too bold a step . ''
`` Not a bad idea , '' went buzzing about backwards and forwards .
`` Shall I retire ? ''
asked Croässaquagha , who thought she might be an intruder on the council .
`` No  stay and help us to consult , '' answered the Queen .
`` Your suggestion is altogether so remarkable that one does not know what to make of it all at once .
Has any one anything to say ? ''
`` It 's a come-down for Brekekex , in his position , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` But , as Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , she seems to be legally eligible , when one comes to think of it .
And , then , she 's ready at once .
It 's queer  but we might do it . ''
`` It 's queer , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` But I 've been making up my mind that I should like it .
She and I are very congenial . ''
`` It is queer , '' said the Princess Royal .
`` But she is stylish-looking and striking in her way , though she is so unfortunately plain .
And , if Brekekex likes it and there is no other marriage he can make , I do n't see why he should n't do it . ''
`` It is n't so very very queer , when you come to think of it , '' said the Princess Guachapeara .
`` A Dressmaker Plenipotentiary is somebody .
As , at the very best , Brekekex could only have a Happypool wife , not a Royal Princess , I do n't see why Daffodil should n't be counted good enough , now he can get no one else . ''
`` Technically speaking , she is eligible , there being no one else , '' said the Regius Professor of Everything .
page : 244 `` There are points in favour of this sole candidate 's being chosen as a future Queen for Prince Brekekex , as well as points against it , '' said the Head Royal Physician .
`` Well , '' said Her Majesty , `` you all argue powerfully in favour of this unequal marriage for Brekekex , and I do n't like to stand against such earnest persuasion .
Still , are n't we rather straining the law to let her in ?
It can only have been for such a very junior Prince that it was intended that a person with no Royal Blood , - even so high a person as a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary - should be eligible . ''
`` That is true , Your Majesty , '' said the Regius Professor of Everything , not discerning that the Queen was willing to have her objection removed .
`` It was for the tenth son of the eighth son of a reigning King that the law was made , and there has been no second instance of a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary not of Royal Blood being admitted into the Royal Family , by Marriage . ''
`` Perhaps you have found second instances of Happypools being allowed to manage to become Kings for want of wives for the proper Prince , '' replied Her Majesty witheringly .
The Professor resumed his speech .
`` But , if I may express my belief of the view which will be taken of this matter by the nation , the world , and the writers of Croäxaxican history , the present circumstances render the proposed bride , not merely eligible , but exceptionally eligible for promotion to be the consort of His Royal Highness .
She is in fact indispensable . ''
On this the Queen began to see so many diffi - page : 245 culties and grave objections that to decide in favour of the marriage seemed growing impossible .
It was Croässaquagha who brought back the discussion to firm ground .
`` One argument has been overlooked by every one , '' she remarked .
`` The marriage of the present Dressmaker Plenipotentiary to Prince Brekekex , even if it were not held sufficient warrant for her resigning her office now , would require her doing so ere long when she became Queen of Grachidichika . ''
`` It will be quite proper for her to resign now , on her marriage , '' said the Queen eagerly .
`` An excellent notion !
And she can invent all the dresses without any one knowing and do lots of things in secret instead of Guachapeara , until Guachapeara has got quite used to having great ideas . ''
`` That would be nice for her ! ''
exclaimed Guachapeara enthusiastically .
`` I sha n't let her always be doing Guachapeara 's work , however , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` I shall want her to help me , you know . ''
`` But you must not be selfish and stand in the way of your sister 's getting a genius '' remonstrated the Queen .
`` That 's true , '' replied Brekekex .
`` And I do n't mind some sacrifice for a good purpose .
The frog whose soul preserves heroic mood Will ne'er refuse to let his wife do good . ''
`` And she will have more time a great deal to help you than she has now , for she wo n't be sitting in the Plenipotentiary Chair of State , nor giving audiences to any one .
She will only get ready ideas for Guachapeara privately at odd moments , '' said the Queen .
`` And , now that 's settled , '' she continued , page : 246 addressing everybody in general , `` the next thing we ought to decide before we go to bed is whether the marriage must be a compressed one or whether we can have it at full length . ''
`` That seems to depend altogether on King Grenoulcrawk , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` What does the Head Royal Physician say ? ''
`` I think the full nine days ' wedding without compression of days feasible in King Grenoulcrawk 's present state , '' replied the Head Royal Physician .
`` He is likely to go on as he is for some weeks if nothing disturbs him again , although the least chance may end him suddenly .
Unless an unexpected emergency arrives , the nine days will be able each to have its full length and every ceremony due to the exalted bridegroom .
But , for fear of an unexpected emergency , I would urge that the wedding , however long it lasts , should begin at the earliest possible moment . ''
`` And that depends only on the white water-lilies , '' said Her Majesty .
`` So we shall not be forced to lose much time . ''
`` There are some capital buds just in a state to be made suit , '' Guachapeara observed , with the authority of her technical instruction .
`` But the full-blown flowers are past use just now .
I am afraid it must take a week before there can be a wedding dress . ''
Guachapeara 's verdict on the dress-growing possibilities might reasonably be considered final , so it was at once decided that Prince Brekekex and Daffodil should be married that day week .
This left but scant time for the preparations for an event of such great public importance  but every moment of page : 247 delay was fraught with the danger of Brekekex 's becoming King before his marriage .
The Lord Chamberlain was sent for , late as it was  the King , who had long gone to bed , was waked up to give his consent - which he did with surprising alacrity , saying before he fell asleep again `` It 's the only way , and I was wondering Raucacoäxine did n't think of it '' - and , the King 's consent having warranted immediate action , the Lord Chamberlain received instructions to start the rejoicings on the Prince 's betrothal at once .
Heralds were to be sent out at earliest day , with music and flags , to announce all over Croäxaxica the happy news and invite all loyal citizens to be overjoyed and to show it .
There were to be waterworks in the evening , and there was to be a Court Ball - only , the Lord Chamberlain was to see that all the guests invited to the Court Ball were made to understand that they were not to come .
There was not time to prepare for such an entertainment , if people came to it  and so it could only take place in that manner .
There were not to be other festivities for the wedding : but , to make up to Prince Brekekex for that , and on the ground of his being heir-apparent to the throne of Grachidichika , the marriage festivities - and the honeymoon festivities too , if , which seemed impossible , King Grenoulcrawk should live long enough for those to take place in Croäxaxica - were to be on almost the same scale as those for a Crown Prince of Croäxaxica .
But Brekekex , who had at first joined with even more glee than the others in the discussion on the coming season of splendours and stately revels , had page : 248 grown silent as the talk went on , and became pale and thoughtful .
It was only when the Queen , in high good humour , cried `` Come , come , we have settled everything and talked enough , and now we must really break up and go to bed and dream about the fine time coming , '' that he roused from his absorbed musing .
`` It ca n't be , it ca n't , '' he cried .
`` I strive in vain .
I can not marry the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary . ''
`` What do you mean ?
Not marry after all this !
And when the Lord Chamberlain has gone , and , no doubt , has given the necessary orders for to-morrow !
Do n't be so ridiculous , '' said the Queen angrily .
`` We have no time for nonsense . ''
`` It is n't nonsense .
It 's woeful , fatal earnest , '' said Brekekex ruefully .
`` Do listen .
Do you think I can possibly marry without making the offer in one of the most beautiful love poems that was ever written ?
Could I , now , without ignominy ? ''
`` Certainly not , '' said the Queen : `` but what difficulty is there in that ?
You must sit up to-night and write it .
It 's a pity to lose your sleep , but it ca n't be helped . ''
`` But I ca n't make the poem and leave her out of it , '' said Brekekex .
`` Of course not : put her in .
As we accept her for your wife it is only decent to waive her inferiority and treat her exactly as you would a bride of Royal Blood .
Put her into the poem . ''
`` But there is n't a rhyme for Dressmaker Plenipotentiary !
And it wo n't go into blank verse ! ''
said , or rather groaned , Prince Brekekex , in his despair .
page : 249 `` This is fearful ! ''
cried Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` Are all our plans to be overthrown !
Is Happypool to be king ! ''
She wrung her hands .
Everybody gasped , groaned , or said `` Good gracious ! ''
Presently the Queen recovered herself .
She rose with dignity , and addressed Prince Brekekex .
`` Go from my presence , unworthy son , '' she said .
And Prince Brekekex fled .
But , while the Queen , the Crown Prince , the Princesses Zumbarzabulixine and Guachapeara , the Private Under-Princess , the Regius Professor of Everything , and the Head Royal Physician , were still gloomily repining over the sudden collapse of the marriage scheme , Prince Brekekex reappeared radiant .
`` I have done it ! ''
he cried , `` I have done it !
My marriage is sure , and my genius is proved greater than ever !
Hullaboloo !
Kekebrex King and troubadour too ! ''
`` Well , but what have you done ? ''
asked everybody eagerly .
`` Listen to how I shall bring her in , '' said Brekekex .
`` It will be at the end of the poem : just listen ! ''
and he recited - `` If Kekebrex , first of troubadours , Has stolen , ` mong many , that heart of yours , Which is a way his poetry has , It shall be paid you by great King Brekekex , Who , ere that , Rex , must marry .
To-day , still a Prince , I address you as My Dressmaker Plen-ipoten-tiary . ''
The rapture with which this successful effort was received may be imagined .
`` Ah , '' said Brekekex , page : 250 when the applause had subsided , `` you are kind to praise me so .
But I can not but own that I do feel I have indeed achieved something .
No other poet who ever lived could have made her come into the poem .
The rest of it will be easy you know - about her loving me and my being a poet and a King : but to have got her into rhyme ! ''
`` How did so splendid a thought flash upon you ? ''
asked Croässaquagha admiringly .
`` Ah ! ''
said he `` It is n't always one knows the very moment of one 's inspirations  but I do this time .
I went to consult her herself , without letting her know what it was for .
I made the servants that waked her up merely tell her I begged to see her on important and urgent business , and , when she came down , I just asked her how she thought one could get Dressmaker Plenipotentiary into a poem , if one ever happened to want to do it .
She thought it was for my tragedy in decimalets , and said I need n't have a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary in it , as the rhyme was impossible .
I argued the point with her , and then she said , ` Cut it up into syllables , and rhyme to any of them that suit . '
She said ` Poison the Dressmaker Plen - : ' that was the specimen she gave of what she meant .
And all at once , on nothing but that trifling hint , I felt what I was going to do , and I wished her good-night as fast as possible that I might get by myself to work out my conception . ''
`` That is how genius seizes on some insignificant circumstance and , starting from it , springs to its distant goal , '' said Croässaquagha .
`` Is n't it ? ''
said Brekekex sympathisingly .
page : 251 All obstacles having now been removed , the little council could separate rejoicing in the prospect of a speedy and final settlement of the Grachidichikan question .
And , next morning , while Daffodil , all unconscious of the purpose for which her assistance had been given , was still quietly sleeping , the heralds had begun to inform Croäxaxica of her betrothal .
page : 252 CHAPTER XVIII .
ACCUSTOMED as Daffodil had become to meeting with deference and submission , she nevertheless was struck by a something especially reverential in the bearing of her attendants and all who approached her on the morning after that late sitting in the Queen 's private rooms .
There was a tendency too to begin addressing her as `` Your Royal Highness '' - stopping short in the middle to correct the title to her real one - much as the Officer in Command and the Lieutenant of the State Prison had kept tripping themselves up with `` Your Majesty . ''
And she perceived that she was regarded with curiosity , as if something unusual was expected in her words and looks .
But , as she could divine no possible new cause for the symptoms , she readily concluded that they were due to her having so recently nearly been Queen of Grachidichika , and that either they had existed before and , from her mind having been full of all that had happened , she had been unobservant , or , what was still more likely , that , as the Grachidichikan affair had been carefully kept a secret , reports about it had only just begun to spread .
Satisfied with this explanation , she thought no more page : 253 about the matter , merely taking pains to look supernaturally grave at any one who began to give her a more exalted title than her own : by which demeanour she hoped to have it understood that it was not allowable to profess any knowledge of what had passed .
She felt tired , from having been routed up in the night to discuss rhymes with Brekekex , and , as there was nothing particular to call for her presence at the Plenipotentiary Department , she resolved not to occupy her Chair of State that morning .
She would take a book to a favourite corner in her wardrobe and have a holiday hour or two to herself .
So she was soon absorbed in the adventures of some youthful inimitable Croäxaxicans who distinguished themselves at school in various customary ways , good and bad .
She was in delightful suspense about the results of two heroes having played truant to pick guggle-gigs and having got the naughtiest and most agreeable of their sisters to slip away from her governess and come too , when the letter from Prince Brekekex was brought her .
It amused her very much .
`` I did not know that they sent Valentines here , '' said she to herself .
`` And this is really a very good one : it seems to me better than his serious poetry .
And what a trick to play me !
waking me up in the night on urgent business , and the business was to make me show him how to write a Valentine to myself !
It 's an April fool and a Valentine all in one . ''
And , after a good laugh , she went on with the adventures of the truants .
She had not read far , when she was informed that the Princess Guachapeara had come to see her , and page : 254 Guachapeara , instead of remaining in the Plenipotentiary 's Grand Reception Saloon , entered the wardrobe by herself , as Daffodil was about to hasten from it to go to her .
`` This is not strict etiquette , '' said Guachapeara , laughingly .
`` I ought n't to come to you : but I have come , you see . ''
`` It is not the first time , however , that you have been in my wardrobe , though it is the first time you have run in this way , '' said Daffodil in like tone .
She thought her visitor had referred only to the unceremonious entrance into her private retreat , and never dreamed that the etiquette broken was that which required that she , as a Royal Prince 's New-Betrothed , should receive no visitors until the Queen herself had honoured her by a visit of ceremony - a visit which the Betrothed must immediately return .
`` The Queen herself wished me to come , for fear you should not understand all about this evening .
You know about the waterworks ? ''
`` I had not heard of them , Your Royal Highness , '' answered Daffodil .
`` I suppose Her Majesty does not want any remarkable novelty .
I do n't feel sure I could manage anything all at once just now  but I can try . ''
`` Oh , never mind .
Of course there is n't time  everything is in such a hurry .
The Queen says you are to mind and put on , besides your fillet of office and your star , the diadem she gave you and all the other jewellery .
The dress you are to wear will be brought you : it 's one of the occasions when everything every one wears is fixed , so you can leave it all to the officials in your department .
There 's a ball too : but no one is to go to it . ''
page : 255 `` Then what is the use of having a ball ? ''
asked Daffodil , surprised .
`` Only for etiquette , '' replied Guachapeara .
`` By the way , have you had Brekekex 's letter ?
What did you think when you got it ? ''
`` Yes , I 've had it , '' said Daffodil .
`` It 's capital . ''
`` You must n't let it turn your head , '' said the lively Guachapeara .
`` I can understand a joke , '' was Daffodil 's laughing reply .
`` I am staying too long , '' said the Princess .
`` Now , be sure you quite understand .
The Queen has so much to think of that you wo n't hear anything of her at all all day , not till just before the waterworks .
And you must be ready .
You 'll come to the Palace , and then we go out to the waterworks , all of us together . ''
`` I do n't understand , '' said Daffodil .
`` Did you say Her Majesty will want me at the Palace ? ''
`` Just in time to go to the waterworks with the Royal Party : yes . ''
`` I will be sure to be in time , '' said Daffodil , still not aware that her appearance was to be in any other capacity than that in which she had so frequently attended the Royal Party in public .
`` I have n't a doubt you will , '' said the Princess .
`` Good-bye till then , '' and away she flopped , humming , `` My Dressmaker Pleni-poten-iary . ''
As soon as Princess Guachapeara had left her , Daffodil went to consult her officers as to what page : 256 preparations it might be the duty of the department to make for the attendance of the Royal Family and the Court at the evening 's display .
But the Head Secretary Spinster informed her , as Guachapeara had done , that this was an occasion on which what every one should wear was prescribed .
`` What is the occasion ? ''
asked Daffodil .
The Head Secretary Spinster looked puzzled .
at the inquiry .
`` The waterworks , I mean , Pre-eminent Madam , '' she replied .
`` The ball , for which otherwise we should have been expected to introduce something special , is merely nominal , as you are aware . ''
Daffodil soon went back to her book .
She found it so interesting that she was still reading it at dinner time , and later she allowed herself , before she laid it aside , to be reminded several times that she would have little time to dress .
When she at last entered her dressing-room she found , instead of the simple costume which had never before been considered inappropriate for her on the highest occasion , a bodice consisting of a rainbow-coloured flower something like a sweet pea with its butterfly petals sticking out like wings , a skirt made of an enormously wide and many-leaved peony , and leggings and shoulder frills of an immense quantity of the down of a plant with pale blue seeds , the seeds making on the soft down frills a heading which looked like turquoise beads .
`` I ca n't wear these things , '' said Daffodil , `` Though the frilling is certainly lovely , and I wish I had known of there being that sort before .
Just run quickly and get me a heather-bell .
Any colour  I have n't left time for choice . ''
page : 257 `` Your Pre-eminence can not possibly wear anything else this evening .
And oh , dear Pre-eminent Madam , do allow us to make haste .
The Queen may summon you at any moment , '' pleaded her attendants , in extreme anxiety .
`` But I can put on my usual sort of dress in half the time , '' said Daffodil .
`` Oh , do please let us dress you , '' was the urgent reply .
`` Consider , Your Roy - Pre-eminence , it is we that will be blamed , and perhaps dismissed or degraded , if you are in something wrong , or if you are ready too late . ''
`` Well , '' said Daffodil regretfully , `` if it is my business to wear these things to-night , I do n't want to get you into trouble by not doing it .
And we 'll make haste . ''
There was need for haste .
At that moment a servant rushed breathless into the room to say the Queen was actually entering the outer corridor .
`` The Queen come for me herself ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil .
`` She would be sure to do that , '' answered the Head Attendant : but there was no time for talking and explaining .
Daffodil 's toilet was made at racing speed - not a moment to stop and take breath !
Her maids held and handed what was wanted , and got the things on her with such precision and speed that what had seemed impossible was done and , although she could not receive Her Majesty at the outer entrance , as she should have done , she was got into the Grand Reception Room just in time to meet her at its portal .
Daffodil presented a magnificent and courtly appearance in her brilliant costume , in spite of her peony skirt being shorter than had been page : 258 desired for her - a deficiency which was the result of there having been no time for the Royal Dress-growers to develop a peony adapted to her special requirements .
She wore , behind her jewelled fillet of office , the superb tiara the Queen had given her for her marriage with King Grenoulcrawk : she wore too , Croässaquagha 's necklace and all the other splendid ornaments which had been her wedding presents .
No one could have worn such jewels without appearing beautiful and aristocratic , and all who saw Daffodil in her costly raiment and rich and rare adornments that evening had to admit that , however wanting in regularity and symmetry her features and form might be , she had striking attractiveness and looked born to be the wife of a Croäxaxican Prince .
To Daffodil 's amazement , she found that Her Majesty was escorted by the Crown Prince and attended by her whole State Suite .
`` There , '' said Her Majesty , `` now I 've come .
It 's most unfortunate that we have no time for doing things properly .
But still we do them , and that is the great thing .
I have come .
Now I am going back , and of course you and your suite must come at once to return my visit .
Oh , by the way , I 'll kiss you and you may kiss me .
There , that 's done .
Come as fast as you can , because it 's quite time for the waterworks to be going on , '' and she twirled round , and scurried off on the Crown Prince 's arm .
He had no time to say anything .
Daffodil did as she was told , and , joining her Suite of Honour , whom she found already waiting for her in her ante-chamber , hastened to the Palace , arriving a couple of minutes after Her Majesty 's return .
page : 259 `` That will do , as we are so short of time '' said the Queen , the moment Daffodil entered her presence .
`` You have come .
Now we must hurry to the great gardens for the waterworks : our entry will lose its imposing effect if people get too tired of waiting .
Of course , you can only walk in your proper place behind the Royal Princesses .
The King , himself , will be present , and , of course , will walk with me : that leaves the Crown Prince for the Crown Princess , and Prince Brekekex must , of course , escort the Princess Royal . ''
She turned to get the King , who was in an arm-chair behind her , and then led off the procession .
On being marshalled to the seat assigned to her on the Royal Platform , Daffodil perceived that the arrangement of places was not as she had found customary .
At such public spectacles she had hitherto seen the Crown Prince next to the throne of the Queen , the Crown Princess to that of the King , next to her Prince Brekekex , and next to the Crown Prince the Princess Royal  the other Princesses being ranged at each side according to the precedence of their ages , and Daffodil 's own station as Dressmaker Plenipotentiary being next to the youngest Royal Princess , with her chair on a lower level .
This time , the King had the Crown Princess beside him as usual , but it was Prince Brekekex who sat by the Queen .
The Crown Prince was beside his wife , next to him came the Princess Royal , then the Princess Guachapeara and every one of the Royal Princesses , and there was no room left on that side for Daffodil .
A chair was vacant beside Prince Brekekex , a chair like his and on the same page : 260 level , and to this the Lord Chamberlain escorted her .
`` I do n't sit by the Princess Boghowla , to-night then , '' she remarked , half questioningly .
`` No , Your Pre-eminence , '' said the Lord Chamberlain with a broad , though courtly , grin .
`` It looks as if I were promoted to being a Royal Princess myself , '' she said , smiling at her little joke , as she was about to ascend to her chair on the topmost row .
`` Your Pre-eminence will observe that all the Royal Princesses are on the other side , which obviates that appearance , '' replied the Lord Chamberlain , as he handed her up .
Daffodil was just sitting down when the King and Queen rose arm in arm , the Crown Prince and Princess , also arm in arm , and all the Princesses rising with them .
Brekekex , perceiving Daffodil 's momentary inattention , put his arm through hers and jerked her to her feet with a promptitude for which she was grateful , as she felt that the offence of sitting while the Royal Family had risen to greet the inimitable Croäxaxican public would have been one of grievous discourtesy and disloyalty .
The King , having made his appearance in public , had done all that he felt could be required of him , and he had no sooner risen and smiled at his subjects than he began to go , followed by his sons , who , however , returned and resumed their seats long before the roars of applause that had answered the greeting of the Royal Family were over sufficiently for the singing of the national song to begin .
It was not till the piano part of the national song page : 261 had at length arrived that there was possibility of any one making an audible remark to his neighbour - so tumultuous had been the din of loyalty .
Then Prince Brekekex turned to Daffodil and asked `` Did you get my poem ? ''
`` Yes , '' said she with cheerful promptitude .
`` I was quite delighted .
It 's one of the best Valentines I ever saw . ''
`` I thought you would admire it , '' said Prince Brekekex , much gratified .
But he added on afterthoughts , a little reproachfully , `` What I was going to ask was , do n't you think it deserved an answer ? ''
`` It did n't strike me that you would want it answered , '' she said .
`` We do n't often answer Valentines in my country : we 're not always supposed to know who sends them - even when there is a name put in them , it is sometimes somebody else 's , you see .
And I do n't know if I can answer in verse .
However I 'll try , if Your Royal Highness wishes . ''
`` I think it will be nicer if you do , '' replied Brekekex .
`` We can publish the correspondence , you know , if it is in poetry .
I 'll help you .
But what did you mean about somebody else putting in my name ?
I put it in myself , and yours too . ''
`` Yes , I saw that , '' she answered .
And a burst of the song after the soft bit stopped conversation effectually .
At the next opportunity of being heard , Brekekex , who had been thinking over it , asked her `` What is a Valentine ? ''
`` In my country letters in verse of the kind you wrote , are called that , '' she said .
`` But they are only sent on Valentine day . ''
page : 262 `` What a very inconvenient arrangement , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` But no doubt for a member of the Royal Family a Valentine day is made on purpose , if he is in need of it . ''
The shooting up into the air of a thousand golden jets stopped Daffodil 's answer on her lips .
The waterworks had begun .
One beautiful and fantastic combination of shining water followed another in rapid succession .
Daffodil was quite carried away with her delight .
She could scarcely wait , according to etiquette , for the Queen to lead the applause , and she and Prince Brekekex clapped their hands with a vigour which won them enthusiastic popularity .
The spectacle was coming near its conclusion - as was made evident by the display of more striking devices , each excelling its predecessor in splendour - when , in the midst of a network of quivering pools of every imaginable colour , there appeared LONG LIVE PRINCE BREKEKEX , THE FUTURE KING OF GRACHIDICHIKA , at which everybody , and especially Brekekex and Daffodil , applauded louder than ever .
When it seemed time for this waterwork to fade out or change into another , it remained steady and some silver streams stole gently underneath the letters and presently formed themselves into AND HIS BRIDE .
`` The baby has been born ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil .
For she thought it would be odd to have such an inscription in honour of a person who did not exist .
page : 263 `` Yes .
And I am glad things have turned out as they have , '' said Prince Brekekex .
But Daffodil was not in the least aware he was paying her a compliment , and gave all her attention to applauding .
The next display was formed of outlines of flowers of every imaginable tint .
There was an empty space in the middle , and in that there slowly shaped itself , traced in silver and green waters , a water-lily amid its leaves  and then there sprang up above the water-lily HAIL TO THE DRESSMAKER PLENIPOTENTIARY .
At this Daffodil was startled and alarmed .
`` Oh dear ! ''
she said .
`` Is some promotion going to happen to me ?
I know there 's something horrid coming . ''
`` No , no , '' said Brekekex , hurriedly .
`` Nothing of the sort .
But make haste and applaud to thank the people .
I 'll help you . ''
This display went out so suddenly that the people who were cheering were left with their mouths open in their surprise .
And then there burst out , in dazzling light , streams that went darting and flashing about and all at once zigzagged themselves into a border inclosing the following inscription - IN GRACHIDICHIKA BY AND BY LONG LIVE KING BREKEKEX AND QUEEN DAFFODIL Daffodil sprang to her feet .
`` No !
no !
no !
It 's a mistake !
A mistake ! ''
she shouted and screamed .
But the cheering drowned her words and she was supposed to be , like Prince Brekekex , vociferating her satisfaction .
page : 264 She had tried again , however , when the applause wore a little faint .
This time some one heard her , and sprang to whisper in her ear `` Hush , for your life 's sake !
If there is a mistake , say nothing in public . ''
It was Croässaquagha , who had been sitting behind her , and of whose arrival after the waterworks had begun she had not been aware .
`` Wo n't it be too late afterwards ? ''
said Daffodil .
But Croässaquagha had resumed her seat .
Daffodil had but little time to reflect  already the combination of names which had alarmed her was paling out .
In a moment a shining sea-green flood swept over the whole , and from that there rose rainbow-coloured and flame-coloured serpents which wreathed themselves into LONG LIVE THE CROWN PRINCE AND PRINCESS and then into LONG LIVE one member of the Royal Family after another , winding up with LONG LIVE OUR UNPARALLELED KING AND QUEEN .
THE INIMITABLE CROƒXAXICANS SALUTE KING LOGAPLOP AND QUEEN RAUCACOƒXINE , which was the signal for everybody to sing the Croäxaxican national song again .
What reflection was possible , however , showed that Croässaquagha 's warning was well timed and wise .
Now that matters had gone so far as Daffodil had unwittingly allowed them to do , her creating a public disturbance could not but make them worse .
It had been arranged that , in order to enable Prince Brekekex to lead out his affianced bride in the sight of the people , and yet to prevent the page : 265 impropriety of Daffodil 's seeming to take precedence of the Royal Princesses , Prince Brekekex should leave before the Royal party took its departure in official order .
He therefore rose at the cessation of the National song , and , whispering to Daffodil `` We are to go now , with our own suites , '' offered her his arm .
`` I will come now , not to make a confusion , '' said Daffodil .
`` But I would rather not take your arm , if you please . ''
`` Very well , '' said Brekekex .
`` I like the other way best , myself , and we have our choice , '' and he took her hand before she saw what the other way meant , and turned briskly round to make his salutation to the Queen , drawing her with him .
Thus hand in hand they made their obeisance , amid deafening shouts from the people , and then their attendants surrounded them and they withdrew together - still hand in hand for all that the observers knew , although Daffodil had dragged herself away , to which Brekekex made no objection , as they could not conveniently descend from the lofty platform linked together .
Directly they had got away from the assemblage , Daffodil began `` I do n't understand what has been going on , but I am afraid I am in some scrape , and I hope Your Royal Highness will be kind enough to help me out of it . ''
`` Certainly , my dear , '' replied Brekekex with affectionate promptitude .
`` I 'm your natural protector now .
And you may call me Brekekex when we are conversing in an unceremonious manner . ''
`` Will you tell me what the meaning of my name page : 266 being in the waterworks is ? ''
she asked , eager to get to the matter in her mind .
`` Stop a minute , '' said Brekekex .
`` I must think of a rhyme .
Oh , this 'll do .
I perceive your pardonable pride , With your name so blazoned far and wide , But , whatever honours may befall , I consider you deserve them all , Being bride to Brekekex And likewise to Kekebrex . ''
`` Nothing of the kind , '' said Daffodil .
`` I am not your bride .
I can scarcely believe you mean it in earnest , but if you do - '' `` Fear not , I 'll keep the word I speak , And marry you this or next week , '' interrupted Brekekex .
`` Do listen to me , '' she said anxiously .
`` I hear the shou ting for the Queen 's coming away , and I want to tell you before I speak to her that it would be quite nonsense for you to talk in earnest about marrying me .
You see , I am a human being and I could n't think of marrying a frog , even if I were grown up . ''
`` I have waived all consideration of your race , '' said Brekekex .
`` Forget what your unworth may be , My choice has made you fit for me . ''
Daffodil heard the steps of the Royal procession approaching .
`` Well , '' she said hurriedly , `` There 's no time to argue .
I wo n't marry you - and if you have any kindness in your nature you 'll help me not - and if you do n't I 'll never find another rhyme for you ! ''
and she rushed on to get to the Palace by herself .
page : 267 Brekekex stood in stupefaction , his attendants , much surprised by his sudden halt , of which they could not divine the cause , standing similarly motionless behind him , while Daffodil 's swiftly followed her .
`` What has happened ? ''
asked Her Majesty , coming up before her son had recovered himself enough to stir .
`` I ca n't imagine , '' answered Prince Brekekex in a pensive tone , and , mechanically , he fell into his regulation place in the procession .
Arrived in her own drawing-room , the Queen said briskly to Brekekex `` We were to have found you and your betrothed bride waiting for us at the supper table .
Lead her there at once .
I am hungry and I wish to be able to go there without more loss of time . ''
On this Daffodil advanced .
She had had two or three minutes to think over what she must say , and was ready .
`` May it please Your Majesty , there is some misunderstanding about my being his Royal Highness 's betrothed bride .
I never knew that it was thought possible to confer that dignity on a foreigner like me , and I really could not undertake the position . ''
`` Very proper humility , '' said the Queen approvingly .
`` And I am pleased with your gratitude .
But , as I want my supper , you need n't do it any more .
Now go off quickly with the Prince . ''
`` Your Majesty has not understood me , '' said Daffodil firmly .
`` I can not marry Prince Brekekex . ''
`` What !!! ''
cried the Queen .
Amazement and consternation was on every countenance .
There was silence .
page : 268 `` You .
Despise .
His .
Royal .
Highness .
Of .
Croäxaxica .
Prince .
Brekekex .
My .
Son !!!!!!!! '' said the Queen , with a full stop after each word , so emphatic was her utterance .
`` Your Majesty , I think him , besides his being a great Royal Prince , one of the very cleverest and nicest people that there possibly can ever have been in Croäxaxica , '' said Daffodil .
`` But I am not a Croäxaxican , and I could n't ever change myself enough to get on with a Croäxaxican husband . ''
`` If we tolerate your imperfections , it suffices , '' said the Queen .
`` And I am not old enough to marry anybody , '' pleaded Daffodil .
`` I do n't know exactly how old I am now , because I have n't been able to make out when my birthdays would have been , but I was ten when I came and I ca n't have been here more than two years , at any rate . ''
`` You are arguing for arguing 's sake , '' said the Queen very severely .
`` At ten years old you were grown up like everybody else , and there wo n't be much difference in you till you are a hundred .
What can it matter how old you are ? ''
`` But , even if I were old enough according to the ways in my country , I could n't possibly get married so .
My father and mother have n't given me leave . ''
`` How can they , when it is quite impossible for you ever to get near them again ? ''
cried Her Majesty pettishly .
`` Pray do not go on with such preposterous objections . ''
`` But if I ca n't get to them , I ought not to do what I know they would disapprove , '' Daffodil replied .
page : 269 `` On reflection , '' said the Queen `` I think your hesitation as to acting without your mother 's commands - and of your father 's with hers - though amusing under the circumstances , very creditable to you , '' and she gave a glance at the Crown Prince , who sometimes wanted his own way .
`` But , '' she continued , `` you may set your mind at rest .
All you have to do is to attend to me as if I were your mother .
And there can be no doubt that your parents would be overjoyed at the incredible honour proposed for you . ''
`` Prince Brekekex , '' said Daffodil , `` help me .
I know you are not so mean as to want a person to have to marry you when she ca n't and wo n't . ''
`` It was n't I that thought of it , '' said Brekekex , ruefully .
`` And you know very well we ca n't help it now .
Why are you so disagreeable to me when I 'm so kind to you , - going to marry you , even ?
I do n't think , after that , you ought to turn round in a pet and say you wo n't find any more rhymes . ''
`` Do not argue , Brekekex , '' said the Queen : `` it is supper time . ''
She rose majestically and , advancing to Daffodil , took her hand .
`` You stand abashed before the immensity of your good fortune and scarcely dare receive it , '' she said .
`` It is well .
But you have now shown humility enough : more would be disobedience .
I accept you as my daughter-in-law .
Aspire to be as nearly worthy of me as your unfortunate birth out of Croäxaxica permits .
Wear your future crown with diligence .
Go to the supper-room as fast as you can . ''
But Daffodil remained fixed in her resolve .
page : 270 Respectfully yet firmly she looked the Queen in the face and renewed her protest .
`` May it please Your Majesty , I am not going to marry . ''
Queen Raucacoäxine could be implacable in necessary punishment when despotism and duty required it , but she was not cruel in her inclination .
And she had a liking for Daffodil .
She turned pale with emotion .
Addressing the culprit in a subdued and solemn voice , she said `` I can not believe you mistress of yourself in speaking so absurdly .
You seem to have had some silly lover 's quarrel with Brekekex about rhymes .
To-morrow you will have forgotten it and will look with horror on your rashness of to-night .
As I wish to spare you , I decide that nothing that has happened in the last half-hour has happened .
But , lest you should not be aware of the full extent of the danger you have been incurring , know that , if you were to act treasonably in this matter , nothing could save you from death .
The betrothal has been announced in the most public manner possible  the King , himself , has made his appearance to sanction it , just as if you had been of a Royal House  the nation has concurred  Prince Brekekex has been harmonious with you in public , and has appeared to share your own enthusiastically shown satisfaction .
If you could contemplate drawing back , it would be an outrage to Croäxaxica and the Royal Family which it would be a danger to the whole world not to punish .
And it would make Prince Brekekex ridiculous to have a person going about who had jilted him .
Prince Brekekex can not be made ridiculous . ''
`` No : that would never do , '' said Prince Brekekex .
page : 271 The Queen resumed `` It would also make Princess Guachapeara ridiculous if the office of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary were not to become vacant for her after it has become a matter of general news and congratulation that she is to have it .
Princess Guachapeara can not be made ridiculous . ''
`` No : that could not be permitted to be possible , '' said Princess Guachapeara .
`` Now you quite see how it is , '' continued the Queen .
`` Your marriage to the Prince , derogatory as it is to him , as you so keenly feel , was agreed on for reasons of public expediency and is absolutely necessary for this country and for the allied country of Grachidichika .
Your resistance would , under any circumstances , have been treasonable : after the solemn acts of this evening it would be - I do n't know what it would be ! ''
`` No , indeed ! ''
groaned , sighed , or gasped , everybody , as the Queen paused struck dumb by the force of her idea .
Daffodil gazed helplessly around her .
`` Now you understand , '' said the Queen .
`` And , as I should be very much annoyed by your being put to death , you must be careful for the future not to show any of these spoiled child 's whims .
Go to supper . ''
`` Does Your Majesty mean that I should be put to death just for not wanting to be married ? ''
Daffodil asked , trying to be firm , but with a faltering voice .
The Queen replied very gravely , `` A person intended for Grenoulcrawk , King of Grachidichika , could have been saved from her disobedience and married to him no matter how .
No such mercy page : 272 could be extended to a person exhibiting an impertinent hesitation to marry the son of the King and Queen of Croäxaxica : the nation , the world , will be spectators of the wedding , or eager hearers of all its details .
However much I might wish to indulge your caprices , I could not permit you to appear at the ceremonies in handcuffs and a gag , nor to disturb the proceedings by being married against your will .
You must not indulge any hope of that . ''
`` May I go home and think ? ''
asked Daffodil .
`` There is nothing for you to think about , '' said the Queen , getting somewhat out of temper when she found that her clemency and her eloquence had not yet completely won Daffodil 's submission .
`` Nothing of any sort for you to think about .
However , you can go : we do n't want you with us spoiling the betrothal supper with your tiresome ways . ''
And , turning to the Crown Prince , she said `` Lead me in to supper .
We can go in proper order now the difficulty about the bride is got over . ''
As the Royal Party began to move , Brekekex escorting the Princess Royal , Daffodil rushed forward and threw herself on her knees before the Queen .
`` Oh , do , do , do let me off marrying '' she implored .
But the Queen pushed her away .
`` Brekekex or the Boa Constrictor ! ''
she cried in a wrathful voice , and bounded on .
All the others bounded after her , not venturing a word or a look , and Daffodil , yet kneeling , was left alone .
page : 273 CHAPTER XIX .
CROƒSSAQUAGHA was with Daffodil betimes next morning , once more sent by the Queen .
With every argument and persuasion she could think of she tried to convince the bride of Prince Brekekex and future Queen of Grachidichika of her exalted happiness , or at least to win her compliance .
She more easily impressed her with the terrible danger of disobedience , and Daffodil resolved to obey the orders brought her from Her Majesty to betray no hesitation to those around her .
As to consent , she was not asked for that , the Queen felt too sure of her final readiness to need it , and desired to avoid calling forth a perverse answer now .
Croässaquagha told Daffodil that she would now have , as her companions and guardian attendants , according to the etiquette for a Prince 's betrothed bride , three ancient females of rank , of whom one must be blind , one deaf , and one discreet .
`` What shall I do with them ? ''
said Daffodil , aghast .
`` I can never manage to keep talking to them all day . ''
`` You will be talking to Prince Brekekex , '' said Croässaquagha .
`` And , even when he is not with you , page : 274 you need not talk to them unless you like .
But they must always be with you when you receive any visit , and when you go out . ''
`` Then I shall be nothing but a prisoner ! ''
sighed Daffodil .
She had seen no possibility of escaping from her marriage by flight , but still she did not like to feel that , if there had been a possibility , the constant presence of these unwelcome companions would have barred her from it .
`` Oh no , '' said Croässaquagha `` no one would think of calling you a prisoner .
You need not be afraid of that .
Only , as it is not etiquette for you to be seen at all in public at present , you can not go outside the enclosure of your own apartments and the Royal Wardrobe and Plenipotentiary premises .
But how can that harm you for a week ? ''
`` I do n't see that it can , '' said Daffodil in a doleful voice  `` since there is nowhere I could run away to , at any rate . ''
Croässaquagha could by no means understand her friend 's repinings , so she found herself forced not quite to believe them .
She went away laughing a little to herself over the sudden change of feeling Daffodil would experience if she could be taken at her word and excused from the marriage .
`` She is Fortune 's spoilt child , '' she thought : `` and she needs to fret a little at her best luck , to be satisfied . ''
The old ladies arrived , solemn and ceremonious , and entered upon their term of service to the betrothed bride .
Soon after them came Prince Brekekex to spend a few hours in complimentary conversation , according to the established rule for engaged persons in Croäxaxica .
The three Ancient Females page : 275 of Rank - The Royal Superintendents Of His Highness 's And Her Future Highness 's Courtship , as their title was on this occasion - should , according to the rule decreed when the office was created in bygone years , have always been in a triangle exactly seven paces from the betrothed bride 's right foot , wherever she might be , while these conversations were going on  but this had been found so difficult to perform quite exactly that , after a few hundred years , an addition to the rule was made and it was provided that wherever any one of the Royal Superintendents of Courtship was should be Counted seven paces from the bride 's right foot , and in process of time it had become customary for them , by way of politeness , to keep far enough distant for even the two that were not the deaf one to be unable to hear what was said .
For this Daffodil felt thankful , as it enabled her , during the long interviews she had to have with Prince Brekekex every day , to use all her arguments and persuasions against his marrying her when it would make her miserable .
The difficulty in her expostulations was that she had all the while , in order that the Royal Superintendents Of Courtship might not suspect what she was saying , to keep up a cheerful manner very different from her talk .
At first it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to make Brekekex understand that she could be anything but the happiest and proudest bride in the world , if their marriage took place .
He could not believe her reluctance was for her own sake  he thought it was for his , because she was so much beneath him in rank and stamped by the peculiarity of her appearance as not of the inimitable Croäxaxi - page : 276 can race .
And sometimes he thought it was assumed in order to tease him or to make him think more of her - and that notion used to make her angry .
When , at last , he did begin to perceive that , strange as it was , she really preferred not to marry him , she still did not seem to have gained much : for , though he said he was sorry to be the cause of any annoyance to her , he could see no possibility of altering the arrangement - there was no one else for him to marry .
Once , when she was very unhappy , she got him so far as to express a wish that he could give up the crown of Grachidichika and be only the troubadour Kekebrex who had sacrificed a throne for his lady-love 's freedom : but he added an explanation of his being entirely unable to do so , as , if he committed such an act of High Treason as to refuse to carry out the marriage after all that had taken place , he should run as much danger as she herself if she were to disobey .
The Queen , the Crown Prince and Princess , the Royal Princesses , and all the great State functionaries , paid Daffodil formal visits .
Sometimes she was on the point of breaking into entreaties or protests , but Prince Brekekex , as well as Croässaquagha , had so urged upon her the impossibility which the Queen herself had pointed out to her of her escaping the doom for traitors , if she displayed her opposition in any way which could lead to its being noised about , that , for her life 's sake , she accepted in silence the references to her approaching marriage made in the ceremonial visits , although she felt that her apparent consent now would make her defence still more difficult if she had to go to trial for resistance at last .
page : 277 So all went on smoothly .
Even Croässaquagha thought her unwillingness quite passed away  for the state and formality with which the betrothed bride had now to be approached made private confidences impossible .
Prince Brekekex , the only person who knew how hard it was to keep Daffodil from the danger of remonstrances , was careful not to tell what could harm her .
But the wedding did not take place on the appointed day .
And many days passed and still there had to be postponement .
Something was amiss with the bridal lilies : each bud that at night was ready to open out , white and radiant , for a Royal Bride 's wearing the next morning , was next morning still closed and was limp and withered and yellow , so that it could by no means be used .
No care could avail : the lilies were never left unwatched a moment  every art , every precaution , was used  but always the same extraordinary disappointment ensued .
At last the Head Royal Physician formed a theory which offered hope .
Her Pre-eminence , the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , was , he said , in the habit of herself every evening inspecting the wedding lilies , as was the duty of her office and , under the circumstances , her natural desire : now , gentle and caressing as her touch might be , it struck him that the feverish fire , which the profundity and wide range of his medical studies enabled him to diagnosticate as permanent in her , must be prejudicial to the sensitive and cold nature of so delicate a flower .
He would advise that Her future Royal Highness should not again handle one of the buds about to open .
page : 278 The Queen , much impressed by this opinion , conveyed it herself to Daffodil .
`` The Princess Guachapeara , your future sister-in-law , and shortly to be Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , shall test the flowers for Your Pre-eminence and future Royal Highness , '' she said .
`` And Your Pre-eminence and future Royal Highness will stand beside her as she does it , so that you can be held to perform that function of your office by her hands . ''
`` But , Your Majesty , '' said Daffodil , snatching at what seemed to her a chance of escaping from both the marriage and the Boa Constrictor , `` If I must not even touch the .
flower , how can I possibly wear it and get married ? ''
This view of the case fell like a thunderbolt on the hearers .
A simultaneous groan arose , and the Queen 's expression of countenance was such that the one of the Ancient Females Of Rank who was deaf could not refrain from exclaiming `` Extraordinary !
Quite unheard of ! ''
although properly she ought to have waited for the Queen to speak first .
`` It is too true ! ''
gasped the Queen .
`` Unhappy unhappy girl , were you born to be disappointed !
First King Grenoulcrawk , and now a greater bridegroom , both escape you in the very moment of your triumph !
And oh Grachidichika !
Oh My Brekekex ! ''
And she wept aloud .
But in this agitating crisis , while almost everybody was either weeping or rushing about to show a desire to do something to relieve Her Majesty 's anxiety , the Regius Professor of Everything , who was that day one of those who had the honour of attending Her Majesty in her visit , remained quiet , page : 279 and thought .
He had felt a little jealousy at the good fortune of the Head Royal Physician in offering such valuable advice , and now it flashed on him as an inspiration that he might be able to find some great expedient too .
He had to think unusually fast  but by concentrating his mind he managed it .
The confusion subsided after some minutes , and Her Majesty , having regained her self-possession , concluded the interview with the customary formalities .
But , instead of saying as usual `` Good morning , my daughter-in-law that will be soon , '' she said `` Good morning , my daughter-in-law that was to will be soon and that I do n't know what we are to do with . ''
Just then the Regius Professor had got his mind quite clear .
He came forward in haste .
`` Your Majesty , Your Majesty , I have something to say . ''
`` Then go somewhere and say it , '' replied Her Majesty , who felt too much disturbed for conversation .
The Professor lingered , and , when Her Majesty had passed on , said hurriedly to Daffodil `` Do not be uneasy .
I must wait to tell Her Majesty another time , but I have found out how you can manage .
You must be cased in wet mud , and the wet mud must be covered thickly with the green leaves of the water-lilies , and then the lily can be put on you without your scorching it by contact . ''
`` What is that ? ''
said the Queen catching some of the words , and turning back .
The Professor was only too glad to set forth his plan at once .
Its feasibility was evident , and the Queen was overjoyed .
Daffodil did endeavour to show objections to it , but she could bring none page : 280 stronger than the bulky figure she should present and her own dislike to mud , and those could have no weight .
`` Some people are never contented , '' said the Queen  and that was all the notice she took of Daffodil 's observations .
Speaking in a loud clear voice , that those around might hear , she said `` Regius Professor of Everything , you have deserved well .
Your penetration and sagacity have removed a grave State difficulty .
I have conferred on the Head Royal Physician , in reward for the service he has rendered in this matter , the right of wearing at the wedding a white star to be called the Star of the Royal Water Lily .
I confer on you the like high reward . ''
Without waiting for the delighted Professor to conclude the out-pouring of his gratitude , she said to Daffodil `` Good morning my daughter-in-law that will be soon , '' and hastened away to tell the Princess Guachapeara to prepare to act that evening as Daffodil 's proxy in testing any lily bud that promised speedy unclosing .
It was a terrible blow to Daffodil to be forbidden to touch the lilies .
She knew that the warmth of her hand had done them no harm , but , for all that , the Head Royal Physician 's advice was likely to provide her with a wedding dress .
She had every evening dexterously inserted some of her tiny needles into the poor flowers ' delicate stems .
The pricks were so fine that no trace of them was observable , but the needles were lodged within and the lilies were not able to bear this treatment and perished away in a few hours .
Now , the lilies would live .
page : 281 `` It will depend on yourself , '' the words her father had said to her in her dream in the prison , again began repeating themselves in her head  although , by this time , she could only half remember her dream about her home above the river when she tried .
`` It is all very well for something to keep saying ` It will depend on yourself , ' '' said she  `` but the only thing that seems to depend on myself now is whether I will be given to the State Boa Constrictor or not .
And decidedly I will .
I will not marry a frog . ''
The expression aloud and in an emphatic manner of her indignant resolve somehow consoled her , and she began to entertain a more hopeful and contriving spirit .
Prince Brekekex arrived just as she had devised a stratagem .
Brekekex was radiant with satisfaction .
His face looked orange with its glow .
`` Is n't it nice ? ''
said he , `` I think we are quite sure to be married to-morrow , this time .
Guachapeara says she feels confident she can make at least one lily be fit by the morning .
And oh my sweet Ex-Pleni 's pride , Dressed as Brekekex 's bride , And with his own self at her side !
Ex-Pleni does , do n't you think , in the poetry , though it is n't quite accurate .
It comes in like a pet name , you see .
I ca n't make the whole of Ex-Dressmaker Plenipotentiary fit in . ''
`` Would you save my life , if you could ? ''
replied Daffodil .
`` Certainly , '' he said with decision .
`` I shall always make a point of it . ''
page : 282 `` I thought you would be generous enough for what I want , '' said Daffodil fervently .
Brekekex was much gratified .
`` It comes of my being a poet , '' he said with modest deprecation .
`` Poets have high-strung souls , you know .
If it were n't for that , I daresay I should n't be more generous than other people - I mean than people that are n't any more generous than I should be if I were n't generous . ''
`` Then , now I will trust my life to you , '' said Daffodil .
`` Quite so , '' said Prince Brekekex , approvingly .
He thought she was talking of their marriage .
`` But , '' added he as an afterthought , `` do n't you think , now you want to make love , we ought to say the things in poetry ? ''
She had been paying only half attention to what he said , for her mind was dwelling on what she was going to say .
She felt it would be of no use to beat about the bush  she would speak out and take her risk .
She told him how she had served the lilies .
Brekekex listened first in bewilderment and then in consternation : the bare possibility of such a crime had never entered Croäxaxican mind .
`` Terrible ! ''
he gasped , when she had done speaking , and `` Terrible !
Terrible ! ''
he slowly gasped a dozen times , while she anxiously waited for him to have thought of something further to say .
`` Are you ready for me to tell you what I want you to do , Your Royal Highness ? ''
said she at last .
`` It is not necessary , '' he answered , recovering himself , `` I see your drift .
If I were to tell what page : 283 you have told me , you would be put to death : you ask me to save your life by not telling .
I will do it .
I will save your life . ''
`` Unfortunately there is more than that , '' said Daffodil .
And she proceeded to unfold a scheme which would have set Prince Brekekex turning summersaults with amazement and terror , if she had not spoken in such a matter-of-course way that he felt as if surprise must be unreasonable .
Daffodil 's notion was that he should claim that , if she was officially regarded as betrothed to him , he and not Guachapeara was her due representative , and especially as it was in the capacity of wedding-clothes for his wife that the lilies were to be inspected , so that he had a direct personal interest in the matter .
Brekekex readily accepted that view of the case .
`` To be sure , '' said he .
`` You are quite right , My reasoner bright And politician recondite , Guachapeara ca n't be Dressmaker Plenipotentiary till you are not .
And you ca n't be not till you are married above it , or out of existence .
So she has no status as to your wedding-dress .
And , as to her taking my position as your representative , I can not allow anybody to take any of my positions .
Obviously I am your appropriate representative in everything . ''
Daffodil 's notion was , moreover , that , if Brekekex represented her , he should , like her , run needles into the lilies .
She would show him how upon other flowers , and he had better practise it for an hour or so now , in order to do it deftly and unperceived page : 284 when the time of inspection came that evening .
To his remonstrances as to the deed itself , she opposed the merit of its saving her life .
To his protests that he could not be expected to destroy what was indispensable to his marriage , she replied by convincing assurances that she would resist the marriage if there were fifty wedding lilies ready for her .
`` I promise you I will never marry you , '' she said .
`` And you know I never break my promise . ''
`` Never mind : I can manage that for you , '' said Brekekex encouragingly .
`` The person a person makes a promise to always has the power to release a person from the promise : and I will release you . ''
`` But I promised it to somebody , or something , besides you . ''
`` That wo n't matter .
Whoever it is is sure to release you if Prince Brekekex desires it . ''
`` But I do n't know who it is .
It 's somebody or something , that keeps saying inside my bead ` It depends on yourself . '
Whoever it is seems a long way off .
I do n't know where . ''
`` That is perplexing , '' said Brekekex thoughtfully .
`` I am afraid , then , you wo n't be able to get yourself released by to-morrow . ''
After that it took but little more persuasion to get him to undertake to prevent the blooming of the fatal wedding-dress  for he had a tender heart and did not want Daffodil to perish .
Daffodil herself , however , presently began to hesitate .
`` I do not know if I ought to let you do it , after all , '' she said .
`` I believe I ought to take my page : 285 own risk and put none on you .
I was forgetting that harm might come of it to you . ''
`` Dreadful harm , if you delay being ready to marry me too long , '' said Prince Brekekex .
`` It 's a fearful risk for me .
Of course , if you went to the State Boa Constrictor it would be all right at once : the Private Under-Princess could be created Dressmaker Plenipotentiary again the moment you were let down to him , and be eligible .
But , as long as you exist I ca n't get married unless it 's to you .
And Grenoulcrawk may die at any moment .
Oh Brekekex !
Oh threatened wight !
What doom may fall on thee to-night !
Thy noble brow robbed of its crown For want of Daffodil 's wedding-gown ! ''
`` Dear !
dear ! ''
said Daffodil .
`` It does seem very hard on you and Croässaquagha .
I wish I could be got out of the way pleasantly for everybody .
But I ca n't be expected to like being swallowed by a boa constrictor , even now you have shown me the use there would be in it .
I am really very sorry for you about it , though .
But the risk I was feeling afraid about for you was n't about what you say , but about what might happen to you if you got found out . ''
`` That depends on whether the Queen would forgive me , and whether the offence could be hushed up from all the world , '' answered Prince Brekekex .
`` I do n't think she would forgive me till it was much too late - not till after my execution . ''
`` Then , do n't touch the lilies .
Pray do n't , '' said Daffodil earnestly .
`` But I am not in the least afraid of being found page : 286 out .
No one would dream of such a thing being done , even if they saw I was doing it , '' said Brekekex .
`` Of course I would not be so foolish as to undertake it if I were not sure of that . ''
Daffodil 's plan was carried out .
The lilies went on withering , although her hand no longer touched them .
There was much marvel , and a suspicion arose that there was something supernatural at work - a suspicion which was the more noised abroad that the Croäxaxicans do not believe in anything supernatural .
What added to the appearance of some extraordinary interposition in the fate of the lilies on which the marriage of the Heir Apparent to the Grachidichikan throne depended , was the convenient continuance in life of King Grenoulcrawk .
There was no moment at which he might not be just about to give the last faint gasp , but yet he continued to breathe on .
The Head Royal Physician was very proud of him : but this time the Head Royal Physician overrated his science .
What was really keeping the old King strong enough to be alive was , not the potency of the Head Royal Physician 's medicines , but that of Queen Chachareraroncaxa 's scarlet guggle-gigs .
Some of these had accidentally been served to the King among the usual kind of guggle-gigs and he had relished them so much that he would eat nothing else , and would drink nothing but the ooze in which they grew .
The plants had lost much of their scarlet hue and the richness it betokened , now that the waterings with the impregnating lighting water had ceased , but they still retained some of the value they owed to it , and the ooze still had some mixture page : 287 of the former fluid .
Such as they were , and scanty as was their quantity , and still scantier as was the wasting invalid 's power of using them , the new guggle-gigs with which the late Queen would fain have enriched his kingdom had in them a strengthening virtue which was now protracting his life in so unexpected and opportune a manner .
Meanwhile the Court of Croäxaxica - nay the whole nation , for ere long the crisis was publicly understood - the whole nation , except Prince Brekekex - passed , with the promise and the blighting of the lilies , from sanguine joy every evening to despair every morning .
The general conclusion , however , was that , as Grenoulcrawk had so surprisingly lived on , he would go on renewing the surprise until the mysterious malady of the lilies had been overcome : for it could not be supposed that destiny intended to frustrate so indispensable an arrangement for the fortunes of a Prince of Croäxaxica as was now in question .
As to poor Brekekex , he went on ruefully with his task .
He spent part of every day in trying to make Daffodil see that the time had come for her to let her wedding-dress flower be unhurt and wear it next morning .
`` You 'll put our marriage off too long , and then , when you 've lost the crown , you 'll be sorry , '' he used to warn her tragically .
And once or twice he went so far as to declare that he would not use the needles any longer .
But he felt too much afraid she really would resist the marriage if she were thwarted in her fancy for delay , or whatever the fancy might be that stood in the way of her glad acceptance : he always did use the needles page : 288 again , though declaring it was for the last time  for he did not like to risk the alternative of her being put to death for High Treason and contumacy .
His was indeed a melancholy position .
Yet he grew daily more confident of a happy issue to his period of anxiety .
The protraction of King Grenoulcrawk 's life struck him also as so manifestly designed for his benefit that it must needs continue as long as he required it .
In spite of Daffodil 's present unaccountable vagary , he could feel no doubt of the secret joy of her heart at the prospect of being his wife and Queen of the second state in the world  and she was showing him a daily increasing affection which assured him that it could not be long now before the constraint she had been putting on herself must break down and she would be at his feet rejoicing .
`` If it were not for the anxiety about King Grenoulcrawk , '' he said to Daffodil , `` I should not disapprove of time being given you to grow to your new position .
You are developing in intellect and heart  you evidently appreciate me more every day . ''
`` It is quite true that I do appreciate you more every day , '' she replied : `` you are so good to me . ''
Quoth Prince Brekekex `` Oh what a happiness fallen to you , A King for your husband !
And liking him too !
Wait and you 'll see How pleased you will be .
Monarch and poet , and marrying you !
But , you know , wait is only poetical for make haste . ''
page : 289 CHAPTER XX .
ONE evening , as Prince Brekekex and Daffodil , with the Princess Guachapeara in her capacity of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary designate , the Regius Professor of Everything , the Head Royal Physician , the high functionaries of the Plenipotentiary Department , and the proper suite of attendants , were advancing to the Royal Wedding-Lily bed , Brekekex gave a horrible cry and threw himself on the ground .
At this dire spectacle every one , struck with horror , threw up his or her hands in a gesture of despair , and gazed heart-broken - every one , that is , except Daffodil , who was busy trying to find out what was the matter .
`` I am murdered , '' groaned Brekekex .
`` Where ?
Oh where ? ''
cried Daffodil , vainly looking for signs of a wound .
`` Oh , Head Royal Physician , do come and do something . ''
Thus summoned , the Head Royal Physician roused himself from his grief and advanced with slow and thoughtful steps , pondering over what could be the matter with the unfortunate Prince .
`` It is his foot , '' said Daffodil .
`` Oh look what has run into it ! ''
and she drew out the thing of page : 290 which she spoke .
The Head Royal Physician took it from her , as she held it out , and examined it intently .
Meanwhile Brekekex lay not daring to move lest he should have been seriously hurt .
`` I am afraid he must be in pain , '' said Daffodil .
`` Shall I bathe his foot and put wet moss round it ?
I think it would take away a bad prick . ''
`` Do nothing , '' said the Head Royal Physician imperatively .
`` Pre-eminent Madam , the case is too serious for temporising measures .
My skill is unparalleled , you will say  shall I tell you the simple secret of that unparalleled skill ?
It lies in this - I never act in ignorance .
Ignorance is to be acquainted with the effect but not with the cause : I deal with the cause , I wrest its secret from it  I know .
You have the history of my scientific supremacy . ''
`` Would you like to look at his foot ? ''
said Daffodil .
`` I may find it desirable to do so eventually , '' said the Head Royal Physician , in a gravely dignified manner which he intended to convey to her a little rebuke .
It seemed to him that she was trying to hurry him , and , although her present exalted position made it impossible to resent anything she was pleased to do or say , he thought it would have been more appropriate if she had kept her mind in a more deferential attitude towards science as represented by him - more especially as even her approaching connection with Royalty could not wholly do away with the distinction between a merely human brain and that of any frog , let alone the most scientifically medical of frogs .
After he had stared fixedly for some time , the page : 291 Princess Guachapeara interrupted him .
`` We have been forgetting to send to Her Majesty , '' she said .
`` Someone must go to her at once .
How can it be broken to her ? ''
`` Let me save him first , Your Royal Highness .
The shock to her will be so much less under those circumstances , '' was the anxious reply  for the Head Royal Physician was not at ease when having to exercise his art under Her Majesty 's peremptory supervision .
He made haste .
`` The cause , '' said he , `` the cause .
It is here in my hand .
I hold it .
And it is - it is - it - is - it - is - it - Drat the thing , what in the world is it ? ''
The amazing and sudden explosion with which the Head Royal Physician concluded his opinion startled his hearers out of what little possession of their faculties the awful accident to the Prince had left them .
Brekekex himself , still lying rigid on the ground , lest moving should hurt him anywhere , gave an appalling shriek as he heard his fate in the medical verdict : Guachapeara wrung her hands , and screamed in echo to her brother .
Sobs were sobbing , and groans were groaning , and doleful voices were lamenting the early end of the beautiful and brilliant Poet Prince , the darling of Croäxaxica , the hope of Grachidichika .
`` An irreparable loss ! ''
sighed the Regius Professor of Everything .
`` Irreparable , indeed , '' they sighed in chorus .
`` I do n't believe there is any harm done you at all , '' said Daffodil , encouragingly , to Brekekex .
`` Do n't you really ? ''
he replied , brightening up .
page : 292 But then his hopeful moment passed .
`` Oh ! ''
he moaned .
`` How can you tell ?
You do n't know what the cause is . ''
`` Regius Professor of Everything , '' said Daffodil , `` do n't you think , if you were to look at the thing , you might perhaps find it is something you know about somehow . ''
The Professor dried his tears .
`` Assuredly I might , '' said he with much satisfaction .
`` I will not say that nothing is unknown to me , but it would be strange if there really were anything that had escaped my researches  I will proceed to identify this strange product of nature or art which has baffled even the stupendous learning of our widely gifted Head Royal Physician . ''
But the Head Royal Physician did not put the article in question into the hand the Professor held out for it .
`` There are matters of science and research , '' he said , `` in which I have to admit that I am but second to our enormous minded and preternaturally learned Regius Professor of Everything .
But in a medical question he himself must admit that not even his astounding ability can be accepted as second to mine . ''
`` That 's just what I mean , '' said Daffodil : `` you know the medical things better than any one in Croäxaxica : this whatever-it-is does n't seem a very medical thing , as it has only done harm , and besides your not knowing it looks as if it could n't be  so most likely it 's an unmedical thing , and the Regius Professor should give his opinion . ''
`` From that perspicacious point of view , I wholly agree with Your Pre-eminence , '' said the Head Royal page : 293 Physician .
`` I trust my all but omniscient comrade in learning will pardon my having intruded on his province .
He will no doubt be able to identify this object , belonging as it does to the field of his special researches . ''
The Regius Professor of Everything turned the object over and over , amid breathless silence .
He had to try very hard not to look puzzled .
At last he thought he must needs say something or he should be taken to know no more about the matter than the Head Royal Physician .
`` It is a relic from the pre-historic period .
The purpose for which it was designed was - was - Ah !
the purpose for which it was designed was that of a secret weapon ( which is why it is , as a weapon , of such an epitomised size ) and also for various purposes of utility . ''
`` Oh !
Let me have it a moment , '' said Daffodil suddenly .
The Professor handed her the subject of his unfinished lecture .
With a rough leaf she wiped the rust from its stem  she could see its head quite bright still in the tiny tuft of spongy moss in which it had got imbedded .
`` It is a pin , '' she said .
In spite of the serious nature of the occasion , her hearers , even Brekekex himself , could not but burst into a shout of laughter at this statement .
The comparison between the stout inch-long spoke she held so fearlessly and the minute pearly threads they knew as pins was too absurd .
She had to explain that the use of this implement for securing their clothes really was a practice of human beings .
As to how this particular specimen of human work - page : 294 manship got to Croäxaxica , she remembered having dropped the pin with which she had fastened to her dress the mysterious flower that had brought her to the country : evidently a runlet had drifted it from the dressing-room near at hand , where it had entered the floor , to the spot where it had struck into Prince Brekekex 's foot .
`` Strange ! ''
said the Regius Professor of Everything , thoughtfully .
`` Strange indeed is it to find in familiar use among the scarcely known race of human beings an implement unmistakably the invention of the Croäxaxicans of the pre-historic time .
There is the germ of a treatise in this instance of the still surviving influence above water of our ancient Croäxaxican civilisation . ''
`` Now I have thoroughly informed myself on the cause of His Royal Highness 's accident , '' said the Head Royal Physician , `` his recovery is well-nigh assured . ''
`` Her present Pre-eminence , the future Queen of Grachidichika , has just been assuring me that human pins , in spite of their look , are not deadly , '' said Brekekex , who was now sitting up and looking cheerful .
`` Not if the case is treated with promptitude , and by some exceptionally highly qualified practitioner , '' replied the Head Royal Physician .
`` I am sure Your Highness honours me by feeling safe in my hands . ''
`` Hullabaloo ! ''
cried the delighted convalescent , springing to his feet , `` Hullabaloo !
How do you do , Brekekex Rex and troubadour too ?
I shall be well , As the doctor can tell , Hopping and swimming and leaping anew . ''
`` Lie down , lie down , Your Royal Highness , '' cried the alarmed physician .
`` I would n't undertake to say what may happen if you recover so suddenly .
The reaction after such a crisis may - may do anything .
Pray be more gradual . ''
`` And I do feel a headache , '' said Brekekex , lying down flat again .
After a careful examination , the Head Royal Physician pronounced that it would be safe to remove the patient to bed in his own apartment , and he was carried away on a couch .
`` He shall recover , trust me , Royal Ladies , '' said the Head Royal Physician , consolingly , to the betrothed bride and the sister , as he went off with his charge .
And now Daffodil knew that a crisis in her fortunes had come .
Brekekex was taken away as an invalid  she herself might not touch the wedding lilies .
`` I must be your proxy for the inspection of the lilies , this time , of course , Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , '' said the Princess Guachapeara .
`` I am sorry I can not consent to that , '' replied Daffodil .
`` But you ca n't help it , '' exclaimed the amazed Guachapeara .
`` There is no other suitable person . ''
`` Prince Brekekex refused to consent to your doing it before , on the ground that you were not the most suitable person , '' said Daffodil firmly .
`` He made a great mistake , '' returned Guachapeara .
`` And , at all events , I must be the proper person to do it , now he ca n't . ''
page : 296 `` As you will , '' said Daffodil .
`` Only , I must make a protest . ''
And in a loud slow voice she went on `` I ask everybody present to take note that I protest against the Princess Guachapeara 's representing me this evening for the inspection of the lilies , and that , if any of the lilies she has inspected are brought me to-morrow , I will say they are illegal after my protest and will refuse to put one of them on . ''
`` Well , now you have protested , I shall proceed to perform the ceremony which belongs to me , '' said Guachapeara .
`` I am Dressmaker Plenipotentiary designate , and by that right I shall represent the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , in Prince Brekekex 's absence , and inspect the lilies . ''
Daffodil said no more .
Her hope , in fact , was that Guachapeara would perform the inspection and so enable her to reject her wedding-dress on the morrow on grounds that would not be High Treasonous .
But Guachapeara hesitated , as she stood by the lilies with her hand already stretched out to reach one .
Supposing the Queen were to disapprove of her acting without special instructions , and were to punish her by not letting her become Dressmaker Plenipotentiary on Daffodil 's vacating the office at her marriage ?
On the other hand it was so evident to her that she was the proper person  and did not her dignity require her to go on ?
She looked round for some responsible adviser to urge her to do so .
`` You think it is my duty to do it , '' she said to the Regius Professor of Everything .
But the Professor , having no suspicion of Daffodil 's secret wishes , did not know how to answer as the page : 297 one great lady required without displeasing the other .
He was seized with a fit of coughing which compelled him to withdraw into the background till it was over , and then he advanced promptly and said `` Your Royal Highness having directed me to make a suggestion , I venture to suggest that it would add to the importance of whatever steps may be taken , or not taken , at this critical juncture by Your Royal Highness and by Her Pre-eminence in conjunction with Your Royal Highness , if a message from Her Majesty enhanced the occasion . ''
A murmur of approval followed the Professor 's words , and Guachapeara herself was impressed with their wisdom .
`` Your suggestion is most judicious , '' she said .
`` It repeats my own idea .
I should be unwilling to take any decisive step before communicating with my Majestic Mother , '' and she at once despatched the Professor as her messenger .
The suspense in which all awaited the Queen 's reply was ended in a surprisingly short time .
Her Majesty herself bounded in among them `` Everybody who holds any authority or office holds it as My deputy - at least I mean the King 's , but it 's all the same - The Dressmaker Plenipotentiary 's a deputy of Me , so of course I can make a deputy of her just as I please .
I nominate the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary designate to be the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary 's proxy .
Get on , Guachapeara , it 's almost past dinner-time . ''
Having thus delivered herself , all in one breath , Her Majesty sat down to recover , as well she might need to do after the haste she had made .
And Guachapeara proceeded without delay with her im - page : 298 portant function .
Daffodil was silent : to renew her protest was useless , for now , if the wedding-dress were brought her to-morrow , to make objection to it as illegally inspected would be just as much High Treason as flatly refusing to be married - and would be untruthful besides , since she could not but feel that , after the Queen 's express nomination , Guachapeara 's proxyhood would be unimpeachable before the law .
`` Not that it makes any difference whether the lilies are inspected or not , '' said the Queen , as Guachapeara withdrew her hand from the last of the opening buds .
`` If they are only going to wither off , they can do that just as well without inspection . ''
`` But the right person should do things , when they are so important , '' said Guachapeara .
`` Of course : and that is why I rushed here directly I heard of the difficulty .
I should have thought myself of the question that would arise , but that I was so agitated about Brekekex .
Where is Daffodil ?
I have n't spoken to her . ''
Daffodil advanced , with some secret trepidation .
`` You were very judicious , dear , to be so careful that no suspicion of illegality should incapacitate your wedding-dress , if it happened to blow for to-morrow , '' said Her Majesty .
`` I am pleased to find you so acute and so prudent .
Why , you have become quite a Croäxaxican already .
And I am pleased with you too , Guachapeara .
It was natural that one of your soaring ambition and enterprise should be eager to fulfil the duty fallen to you : your eagerness proves your competence .
The wisdom with which you page : 299 checked your zeal on the first suggestion that my orders had not been asked shows that you are exceptional among deep and far-sighted thinkers - that you are indeed my daughter .
Now come to dinner . ''
She bounded to the canal and made the shortest cut to the Royal apartments , and Guachapeara followed her .
But the Queen promptly perceived the mistake .
`` Go back at once , '' she said .
`` I am not in State  I am , as the Queen , not here at all  so I can go away how I please and make haste .
But you are here officially , on a State ceremony .
I am shocked that you should so forget your dignity as to come bounding and swimming by yourself in this way . ''
So Guachapeara returned , crestfallen for a moment at the scolding , but not loth to bear her part as so principal a personage in the ceremonial to the last moment of it .
With stately mien , she took her place in the procession and , after having duly escorted Daffodil to her quarters , went in a sort of triumph to her own , where , as she dismissed the long retinue at the portal , they raised a shout of `` Glory to the future Dressmaker Plenipotentiary !
May she always adorn her official performances as she has to-day ! ''
`` Thanks , thanks , my friends and subalterns : I will , '' responded the young Princess , much moved .
Fresh plaudits rang forth at this .
`` She will , she will , '' they all said to each other , `` I know she will . ''
`` I will , '' said Guachapeara again .
`` My faithful friends and subalterns , believe this that , throughout my public career , I will ever be worthy of my private self . ''
page : 300 With a gracious consideration for their feelings , she allowed the cheers which replied to this declaration to continue some minutes before she waved her hand in the customary signal of dismissal of their attendance on her .
And even then she said `` I am forced to go , because I am late for dinner , but I do n't want to cut short your enjoyment of your enthusiasm : you may stay and cheer a bit longer , if you like . ''
I need not say that the retinue availed themselves of the privilege thus accorded , and remained hurrahing till they were too hoarse and exhausted to raise a sound more .
Meanwhile Daffodil was preparing her courage , as best she could , for what might come on the morrow .
This time the great white wedding lilies , unharmed , would open and be ready for the bride .
The only chance of delay she could see was that Brekekex might become really ill  and she thought that improbable and tried not to wish it .
Poor Brekekex had behaved so kindly and faithfully to her that she would not even think of sickness and suffering for him as desirable for her own safety .
`` If anything happens to-morrow morning , awake me at once , however early , '' she gave orders , as she withdrew betimes to her sleeping-room , to be alone .
`` We will bear your commands in mind , Your Pre-eminence , '' was the deferential reply .
`` But Your Pre-eminence need not fear that anything will happen to His Royal Highness , your betrothed husband .
Your Pre-eminence is not being deceived : the accounts given to every one are the same as the report sent in answer to your own inquiry , and the page : 301 Head Royal Physician declares without reserve that the condition of His Royal Highness is most encouraging . ''
`` I am sure of that , '' said Daffodil .
`` I am sure we need not be in the least anxious about the Prince 's health . ''
But , after she had gone into her room , they all pitied her smilingly for being so superfluously anxious about her betrothed bridegroom .
It showed how fond she was of him , they said , and she would make a devoted wife .
It could not occur to any one that the something that might happen which was weighing on Daffodil 's mind was the event for which all Croäxaxica was hoping in desperation , the blooming of the lilies which would usher in her marriage day .
page : 302 CHAPTER XXI .
VERY early next morning Daffodil was awakened by loud splashings .
She had sat up late and , when she went to bed at last , she was both strengthened in heart for the morrow and thoroughly weary  so she slept sound , and she did not hear the softer noises with which her attendants had been trying to arouse her .
The moment she knew she was being called , she remembered what the news they would tell her must be .
`` Pre-eminent Madam , '' said the head of the Upper Royal Wardrobe Maids , entering her room in obedience to her `` Come in . ''
`` The Head Royal Dresspicker and the Head Royal Dressmaker and the Head Royal Secretary Spinster have come in haste with delightful news . ''
`` The lilies have blown , I suppose , '' said Daffodil quietly .
`` To perfection ! ''
was the reply .
`` Then I will get up at once , '' was all Daffodil 's comment .
And the Head Royal Dresspicker thought to herself that , although it was very grand and Royal to repress all signs of excitement at so infinitely joyful a moment , such strong constraint must surely be bad for the health .
page : 303 Daffodil made haste , for she learned that the officials of her staff who had come to give her the instant information of the event they expected to surprise her as them , and to rejoice her still more than them , must not delay making their report of it to Her Majesty .
`` Is it not proper that the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary herself should make such an announcement to Her Majesty ? ''
she asked them .
This was a puzzle to them .
The three Ancient Females of Rank had to be consulted , and the discussion became long and intricate .
Certainly the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary had always gone at the head of her staff to report on a Royal Wedding morning that the lilies were ready for Her Majesty 's selection , and a failure to do so would have been a most irreverent piece of neglect .
On the other hand it was unheard of and inconceivable that a Royal bride should go out Un-Royal-bridally on her wedding morning , for any purpose whatever .
The Head Royal Secretary Spinster thought of a way out of the dilemma : she proposed that the deputation , instead of going to place the Princess Guachapeara at their head as Her Pre-eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary 's deputy , which they had at first supposed must necessarily be the course , should go preliminarily , headed only by the Head Royal Secretary Spinster and her colleagues , the Head Royal Dressmaker and the Head Royal Dresspicker , and receive Her Majesty 's instructions as to whether it must be the Princess or Her Pre-eminence who should undertake the duty of making the announcement to Her Majesty .
It would be quite easy , said the page : 304 Secretary Spinster , for the deputation to be considered not to have seen Her Majesty or told her anything till their second appearance in attendance on their proper head for the occasion .
This scheme gained everybody 's approval but Daffodil 's own .
`` Since you can not tell me what I am required to do , '' she said , respectfully , but firmly , to the three Ancient Females of Rank `` I shall take the right of my office and go to Her Majesty . ''
They wished to hinder her , and her own officials opposed her resolution so urgently that they almost passed the bounds of subordinacy  but she said `` I have decided what to do .
I wish to see the Queen , for reasons of my own  going to her on this errand is my duty as Dressmaker Plenipotentiary and therefore I shall not be doing wrong .
But , if she thinks it wrong , I shall take care she knows I did it against what all of you advised . ''
`` Well , after all , Her Majesty will not blame anything Your Royal Highness-that-is just-going-to-be does to-day , '' said the discreet Ancient Female of Rank .
`` And we can not make you observe a rule , if you positively wo n't - even if there were a rule for the case , '' said the blind one .
`` Exceedingly suitable , '' said the deaf one , seeing that her colleagues were agreed about something .
So much time had been lost in the discussion that , before Daffodil and her train arrived , the news , which had flown from lip to lip throughout the Plenipotentiary Department , had been brought to the Queen and the Princesses with their morning dresses , by their Royal Lady 's - maids , and the Queen had sent page : 305 it to Prince Brekekex with her inquiries after his health .
Just as Daffodil with her retinue had been ushered into Her Majesty 's presence , the messenger who had returned from Prince Brekekex entered the room .
`` Never mind speaking , Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , '' cried the Queen , who was all in a flurry and hurry .
`` I take your report as made  and I order it to be supposed that you have been the person who brought me the first information , as you ought to have been - though what excuse you can have for not coming sooner I do n't see - By the way , I mean that you had no business to come .
A Royal Bride out on the very morning !!!
Where 's Guachapeara ? ''
`` Here , '' said that Princess , who had just entered the room .
`` And I think it a great shame I was not sent for to take my proper place and make the report , when it 's I that have got the lilies to blow at all .
I think I ought - '' `` All right , '' said the Queen , cutting her short .
`` It shall be you that have reported .
Daffodil ca n't be supposed to be here .
Hold your tongue , and let me get on with this wedding . ''
`` May it please Your Majesty , '' began Daffodil , trying to get in what she had come to say , `` I came because - '' `` Never mind , I told you , '' interrupted the Queen .
`` You 've said it all - at least your deputy is considered to have said it all , for I have told her to hold her tongue .
The message from Brekekex is what I want to hear . ''
The message was a thunderstroke .
Prince Brekekex said he was no better than he was last night , page : 306 and reminded his Royal Mother that the Head Royal Physician had prescribed that he should be ill in bed for several days .
`` But I never dreamed that the Head Royal Physician was n't to hurry the cure and get him well at once for a sudden emergency like this ! ''
exclaimed Her disconsolate Majesty .
It appeared that the Head Royal Physician , who had sat by Prince Brekekex 's bed all night , had been summoned by breathless messengers to King Grenoulcrawk a little before the Queen 's message arrived , and that he had begged the Prince not to be too alarmed during his absence , as nothing particular would happen if he kept his eyes shut and never stirred .
Daffodil , on hearing the message from her betrothed , had made up her mind to omit what she had come to say , and to remain a silent observer of what was passing .
But the Queen turned to her with `` You can give some counsel here .
You know the nature of the dreadful thing which stuck in my son 's poor foot : tell me , would there be any danger in his recovering quickly ? ''
How Daffodil wished she could have said there was !
`` If it is the same with him as with us , there could not be any danger in that , '' she had to reply .
`` How soon do people that have had such an accident get over it in your tribe ? ''
asked the Queen .
And Daffodil could only say `` Usually in two or three minutes . ''
`` Then there must be some mistake , '' said the Queen `` Of course , if such inferior doctors as yours page : 307 must be can cure you of a pin-thrust that quickly , our Head Royal Physician could do it in a quarter of a breath .
However , the Head Royal Physician must be told to come to me at once . ''
The Head Royal Physician happened to be at that moment at the entrance of the Palace , to request an audience .
He came before Her Majesty pallid and tremulous .
The cause of his disquiet was soon told : King Grenoulcrawk could not outlive the day .
He could take no food , not even his favourite guggle-gigs - the Head Royal Physician 's potent medicines seemed at last to have lost all influence upon him .
A numbness was creeping over his body by degrees and had already made him more than half dead .
At the first shock of this news , Queen Raucacoäxine was frantic .
She sprang into the air , she sprang down again and shook the Head Royal Physician , she threw herself into her seat so hard that she knocked off the back of it , and , lying tumbled there anyhow , she wept at the top of her voice .
`` Go for all the Royal Family , '' she gurgled out through her sobs .
And all her attendants , and all Daffodil 's retinue , rushed off in obedience to the command .
`` Take Happypool to the Boa Constrictor , '' she cried .
But only Daffodil , Guachapeara , and the Head Royal Physician , were left with her , and none of them felt able to carry out the order .
The Queen grew calmer , and Princess Guachapeara began to soothe her .
Meanwhile Daffodil contrived to write a brief note and to make the Head Royal Physician understand that he must deliver it secretly to Prince page : 308 Brekekex .
He was very willing to oblige her , and saw no reason for disliking taking the bride 's little confidential missive to the Royal Bridegroom .
`` Dear me ! ''
said the Queen , all at once .
`` When I come to think of it , I do n't see what you have all been making such a trouble of , after all . ''
And , as Guachapeara had not left off her attentions , she turned on her rather snappishly .
`` Do be quiet , Guachapeara , I do wish you would learn the proper self-control for one so near the throne . ''
And on this , while the aggrieved Guachapeara was murmuring half audibly `` I need to learn self-control !
As if it were n't I who made the lilies blow when no one else could ! ''
she took Daffodil 's hand kindly , and said `` Leave off fretting , daughter-in-law that-will-be soon : the Head Royal Physician can keep King Grenoulcrawk alive long enough for us to have several weddings by counting the hours days , quite enough weddings for necessary form .
We can do them in the private quick way : and that will be quite right , out of respect to Grenoulcrawk .
And then , as Brekekex will have become King and a King needs more weddings than a King 's second son , we can begin the course of grand public weddings we have been waiting to have .
You have removed all the real difficulty , yourself , you dear sensible creature-quite a Croäxaxican ! ''
`` I remove it , Your Majesty ! ''
said Daffodil in a tone of perplexity .
`` To be sure - Telling me about Brekekex 's getting well , dear .
Head Royal Physician , Her Royal Highness that 's just going to be and present Pre-eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary informs me that the page : 309 proper medical treatment among her nation is that people should get well of pin-thrusts in two or three minutes .
Of course , in that case , any Croäxaxican doctor could cure the thing in half the time , or less , and you yourself can do it in an instant .
I am so glad she was clever enough to know . ''
`` The light thrown on the case by Her Royal Highness that is just going to be and Present Pre-eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , from her native knowledge of the weapon of her nation , is invaluable to a physician , '' replied the Head Royal Physician .
`` That is , to any physician of the wholly exceptional skill which can discern its invaluableness . ''
`` Go and cure him , then , '' said Her Majesty .
`` But I was going to say that , while so strongly recognising the invaluableness of the light that has just been given me , I see something which needs caution .
Has Your Majesty overlooked the all-important fact that the persons spoken of may not have been Royal ? ''
On being interrogated , Daffodil stated that she believed it was the same with Royal People , but admitted that the people she had known recover from pin-thrusts had not been Royal .
`` It can not be contended for a moment that a Royal Person 's illness , from whatever cause , is not more important than any other sort of person 's illness , '' said the Head Royal Physician .
`` Of course no one could be so nonsensical as to contend that , '' said the Queen , impatiently .
`` Do get on . ''
`` I was merely going to add that Royal Persons ' page : 310 illnesses , being so important , must naturally be longer in proportion than other persons ' illnesses , and that we can not assume that a Royal Prince , and above all a Royal Prince of Croäxaxica , can recover as quickly as - '' `` Oh dear !
oh dear ! ''
broke in the Queen .
`` Of course not , no  he 'll have to be ill I do n't know how long .
What shall we do ? ''
`` I will do my best , '' said the Head Royal Physician .
`` Run to him as fast as you can , '' said the Queen .
`` Stop , stop a moment , '' she cried , calling him back in the middle of the bound away with which he was obeying her emphatic dismissal , `` An idea has struck me .
Tell him to feel as un-Royal as ever he can . ''
`` Splendid ! ''
cried the doctor .
`` With that hint , the last difficulty in the path of science is removed .
His Royal Highness shall recover within an hour . ''
`` Rush off , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine , and he rushed , and nearly knocked down the Crown Prince and Princess who were entering together .
One by one , following close upon each other , came the Princesses , and then the King himself .
`` It is just as well you have all come , '' said the Queen , `` because it gathers us altogether to begin the wedding as soon as Brekekex is cured .
But I have n't anything to consult about now .
What we have to do is quite plain and easy , '' and she told them about King Grenoulcrawk 's condition , and what she meant to have done .
All agreed that there could be no obstacle to carrying out the Queen 's plan , and that it exactly page : 311 met the difficulty .
`` But why does n't Daffodil speak ? ''
asked the Crown Prince .
`` Dear thing , she 's so glad , it makes her shy , '' said the Princess Royal .
At that moment there was a loud sound of feet and of something heavy being carried , and Brekekex was brought in on his bed .
His eyes were shut , and he lay as stiff as stone .
`` What does this mean ?
Why are you brought here thus ? ''
asked the astonished Queen .
`` You made me come , '' said Brekekex in an aggrieved tone .
`` And , of course , after the doctor 's telling me not to stir and not to open my eyes , this is the only way I could come . ''
The Queen 's order `` Go for the Royal Family '' had been so scrupulously obeyed by some of her faithful servants that they had summoned even the invalid Prince , and had met all his remonstrances with the emphatic reply `` We had Her Majesty 's own direct command . ''
The Head Royal Physician had encountered his patient on the way , and now stood beside him very uncomfortable .
He had delivered Daffodil 's note : these were its contents - `` My dear Royal Highness `` I promise and declare that I will not marry you .
So you can be quite sure that , if there is to be no other way than that or my being given to the Boa Constrictor , I shall be given to the Boa Constrictor .
Perhaps you will be kind enough not to get well fast .
Only , then you will not be King of Grachidichika .
At any rate , I thank you very much for your great kindness already .
`` Your extremely obliged Daffodil . ''
page : 312 On reading this communication , Brekekex , deeply moved at the thought of the fate his betrothed bride 's obstinacy would bring upon her , explained to the Head Royal Physician that he must on no account proceed with his cure , revealing to him , under a solemn pledge of secrecy , the necessity of delaying the possibility of the wedding by any plausible obstacle .
It was no safe moment or place for conversation : only a few hurried words from the Prince , with the natural assents from his hearer , could pass between them  then the bearers of the couch had to be told to proceed from the antechamber in which this brief interview had taken place into the corridor leading to Her Majesty 's private apartments close at hand .
And the Head Royal Physician , with his brain in a whirl , had to consider in the very presence the appalling difficulties of his position .
He wanted to keep Daffodil alive , he wanted to comply with the wishes of Prince Brekekex .
On the other hand , dared he fail to obey the Queen ?
Could he risk the ruin of his court favour , his professional fame , his fortune ?
Ordered to cure a patient forthwith , he must , at any time , risk at least a temporary disgrace if he expressed inability to fulfil the Royal mandate : but with such a patient , at such a juncture , to express any inability !
And what if Grachidichika were lost to the reigning branch of Croäxaxica and the Queen were to ascribe the loss to his incompetency !!!
Then again came the consideration that , if he did prove his competency , he should be the cause of Daffodil 's death - a prospect very unpleasant to his kindly heart - and that Prince Brekekex would never forgive him .
Nobody , not page : 313 even Daffodil and Brekekex , felt so wretched as the Head Royal Physician just then .
Her Majesty explained to Prince Brekekex the arrangement on which she had resolved for the ceremonies of the day .
`` We shall begin with a simple wedding , '' she said , `` in order to start the sooner  but , if we get on pretty quickly now , we can safely come to one with the very full state ceremonials for a second Prince by this afternoon .
Then we will wait a week for mourning , and then go on with the weddings on the ceremonial for a King .
I shall feel proud to have my second son 's wedding a King 's : I do n't believe any reigning Queen has had that yet . ''
`` Oh ! ''
cried Brekekex , springing from his couch , in his exultation , `` a King 's wedding ! ''
`` You see , '' said the Queen , `` you will be thoroughly married this morning for all legal purposes , to make your accession safe before poor old Grenoulcrawk quite ends : and , as the ceremonies you have a right to as second Prince will not be ended and his death will interrupt them , you must continue them  and , of course , they must be promoted into a King 's ceremonies , as you will be a reigning King when you do continue them . ''
`` It 's grand ! ''
cried Brekekex .
`` King and Queen !
Crowns on their head !
Oh !
what a scene , A King to be wed !!! ''
In his delight , he had overlooked the obstacle as to the bride .
It suddenly occurred to his mind as page : 314 he ended his verse , and , running to her , he seized both her hands , exclaiming `` Oh Daffodil , you ca n't help giving in now you have heard that plan ! ''
`` You know that my mind is made up past changing , '' she answered very gravely .
Then Brekekex perceived that he had , in his excitement , almost published the secret of Daffodil 's contumacy .
So , with great presence of mind , before any one had had time to think what he and Daffodil had been saying could mean , he sprang back to his couch and , lying down fiat again with his eyes closed , said `` What a pity though , that the Head Royal Physician can not possibly cure me for today . ''
`` WHAT ? ''
screamed the Queen .
`` He ca n't , '' said Brekekex .
`` I 'm a difficult case . ''
`` SIR !!! ''
said the Queen to the Head Royal Physician .
The climax of eloquence had been reached .
There was silence and a shiver of expectation .
The Head Royal Physician opened his mouth several times , but could not speak .
And then presently an event took place .
King Logaplop aroused himself , gazed slowly round , and said `` Do it by proxy . ''
`` By proxy ?
Oh yes , '' said the Queen .
`` Some of you go and fetch a doctor to cure Prince Brekekex by proxy . ''
The Head Royal Physician gave a cry of despair .
`` Oh !
Your Majesty ! ''
he burst forth `` It is n't because it 's a difficult case .
I like difficult cases , I do them best - it 's because it 's too easy - I mean it is n't because of anything .
A proxy ca n't cure him .
page : 315 And any proxy for me must be an ignorant fool .
I 'll cure him at once - I mean I would if he were different - I mean if the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary were different - Oh !
I mean I am dangerously ill myself , of a most infectious illness and - '' `` Leave the room instantly , '' shrieked the Queen and all her children in a panic , and the unhappy frog turned and fled .
The King said `` I meant marry him by proxy , '' and resumed his repose .
They all gazed at each other , under the shock of a new idea of such magnitude .
`` Can it be done ?
Is there a precedent ? ''
said the Queen to the Crown Prince .
`` I am wondering if there is '' he replied , with an exhaustive air .
The Regius Professor of Everything was sent for and interrogated .
Alas !
there was no precedent .
But meanwhile Her Majesty had , in arguing on the subject with Brekekex , who took the anti-proxy view , convinced herself that the marriage by proxy would just meet the case .
`` The King 's having himself suggested the method gives it the authority of a precedent , '' she declared .
`` And it 's only to begin with : of course Brekekex will take his place with his wife in the great celebrations afterwards .
But the thing is to get the marriage formally completed to-day .
Now , as to who could be proxy - Prince Brekekex sees a difficulty , Regius Professor , as the Crown Prince would derogate if he took the position for his junior , and as we can not accept Happypool , and the Prince thinks no one else could be made appropriate - your researches page : 316 will , no doubt , have shown you what would have been done in such a case , if there had been one . ''
The Regius Professor of Everything ventured to suggest that the Ambassador for Grachidichika should be selected for the honour .
`` Very good , '' said the Queen and Crown Prince : and the Crown Princess and the Royal Princesses all echoed `` Very good . ''
The Professor was delighted at his success .
But Brekekex jumped up and said hotly `` I wo n't have it .
He is n't married himself  and he may make out he has married her in earnest and claim the Kingdom of Grachidichika for himself in right of her . ''
`` But she has no right to it , '' said the Crown Prince .
`` That 's nonsense , '' said Brekekex .
`` Have n't I got to marry her to be able to get it ?
So of course he can say if he has married her he must have it . ''
`` There is an awkwardness .
certainly , '' said the Queen .
Just then Ranacuajha , who had become somewhat interested in the wedding question , remarked musingly to the Princess Royal , who sat next her , `` I am sorry Daffodil has to marry the Ambassador instead of Prince Brekekex .
My mother , the Queen of Grachidichika always said he was more of a stuffed dummy than the Speaker .
If I were Daffodil , I would rather marry the Speaker . ''
Her Majesty bounded with delight .
`` The Crown Princess has made a most judicious suggestion , '' she said enthusiastically .
`` The selection , for a proxy , of the highest Grachidichikan official , a personage at once so exalted and so unobtrusive , is perfect in its page : 317 appropriateness and its security from all embarrassments .
That settles everything . ''
`` But I do n't like it , '' said Brekekex .
`` My dear boy , do n't make silly difficulties .
If you ca n't go to your wedding yourself , of course some one must go for you .
Some sort of bridegroom is necessary for any wedding . ''
`` Well , if the wedding has to be , whether I 'm at it or not , I 'd rather go to it . ''
Daffodil came forward before a reply could be made .
She saw that her fate was sealed , and she was now afraid that the misdemeanours of Brekekex on her behalf should be revealed by his accidental disclosures .
`` Your Majesty , '' she said with as steady a voice as she could command , `` I have to say that I can not consent to be married . ''
`` Oh ! ''
said the Queen petulantly , `` I have not time to be teased with that nonsense now .
You know you always said it .
You said it about Grenoulcrawk . ''
`` And I did not marry him : I trod on his toe , '' replied Daffodil .
`` On purpose ? ''
cried the Queen , aghast .
`` It was the only way , '' Daffodil said apologetically , while everybody listened in stupefaction .
The Queen reflected .
`` You see , that was High Treason , '' she said .
`` And I do n't know what to do .
Having you executed would be so very inconvenient . ''
`` She ought to be executed for annoying my father , the King of Grachidichika , on purpose , '' said the Crown Princess .
But every one else said `` It would be so inconvenient . ''
page : 318 `` I must order you to have done it by an unfortunate accident , quite unintentionally , '' Her Majesty decided .
`` That settles that part of it .
And , you know , the Speaker will not so much mind his toes . ''
`` I wo n't have the Speaker .
I 'll go myself if anybody does , '' put in Prince Brekekex .
`` Not if she wants to tread on your toes , '' said her Majesty positively .
`` I sha n't mind .
And she wo n't .
Would you now , Daffodil ? ''
`` No , '' said Daffodil  `` I would n't do that .
I should n't like to hurt your toes for no use . ''
`` Then it is settled , '' said Her Majesty .
`` Now make haste everybody  the wedding must begin as soon as possible . ''
`` There can be no wedding for me  indeed , indeed , Your Majesty , '' said Daffodil .
The Queen commanded , threatened , argued , at last even besought .
Then she told Brekekex to try his influence , and he tried .
Then she told all the Royal Family , one by one , to try their influence , and they tried .
Even the King tried , saying first `` I command it , '' and then , when it appeared that even that would not suffice , `` I request it . ''
Croässaquagha was sent for and anxiously used her utmost powers of persuasion .
`` It will be for you , dear , '' said Daffodil , as Croässaquagha pictured the happiness of the wife of Brekekex , King of Grachidichika .
`` But I shall be wretched if you go to the Boa Constrictor '' replied Croässaquagha , weeping .
But Daffodil would not yield .
At last the Queen took a supreme resolution .
page : 319 `` This can not go on , '' she said .
`` The crown of Grachidichika may be lost to us while Daffodil wastes the day in hesitation .
She must come to a decision . ''
`` Oh do , DO , Daffodil ! ''
went forth in a chorus .
`` Listen to me , '' said the Queen .
`` The Royal Family needs her , Croäxaxica and Grachidichika need her .
The having to put her to death would be horribly disagreeable - '' `` Horribly ! ''
murmured everybody aloud , except Daffodil , who only said it to herself .
`` And '' continued the Queen , raising her voice to drown the interruption , `` the public scandal would be intolerable .
To have it known that the bride of a Prince of our own Royal Family has had to be executed just before the wedding !
And for such an act of High Treason !
To refuse to marry My son , Prince Brekekex !!!
What an example to go forth to the country !!! ''
`` If we give up Grachidichika for Brekekex , so that he can go on without marrying till there is some one eligible born ? ''
suggested the Crown Prince .
`` I wo n't mind doing that , '' said Brekekex , who was in tears over Daffodil 's impending fate .
`` It 's of no use , '' Queen Raucacoäxine replied .
`` The public scandal - THE ATROCIOUS REFUSAL - would be just the same .
And Happypool would be King of Grachidichika !!! ''
`` Ah yes !
it 's no use , '' the Crown Prince assented regretfully .
`` I was overlooking at the moment that she ca n't be let live and have done what she would have done .
It would sap the foundations of the monarchy .
Why , it might come to it that a Dress - page : 320 maker Plenipotentiary might refuse a second son of my own some day . ''
`` Quite so , '' said Her Majesty .
`` And now , perhaps you will let me tell you what I have resolved on - a portentous measure , but the crisis is portentous .
Royal Princes and Princesses , you shall bow yourselves to supplicate her , you shall kneel to her - I will kneel - the .
King will kneel . ''
`` I wo n't , '' said the King .
`` Oh please , do n't , anybody , take so much trouble , '' exclaimed Daffodil .
But the Queen was busy whispering to the King , and did not heed her .
And presently the King gave a groan of consent and , immediately leaving his seat with his most imposing air , went right up to Daffodil and arranged himself gravely in the kneeling posture of the Croäxaxicans .
`` Kneel all - Quick ! ''
cried the Queen , as she saw that the King had proceeded at once to action , and she herself and all the Princes and Princesses promptly followed the King 's example and got on their knees , with their feet meeting sole to sole behind them and their hands in supplicatory attitudes , just as if they had been criminal subjects and Daffodil the Royal Being they had offended .
`` I am so sorry .
I am so very very sorry , '' said Daffodil .
`` But I ca n't , I really and truly CA N'T be married this way : it feels impossible .
And I am sure it must be wrong to get married when you know it would make you hate your husband with your whole heart .
Oh , please do n't ask me any more , and do get up .
Prince Brekekex and I are so different .
And I know my Father and Mother page : 321 would think it terrible .
Oh !
do n't kneel any longer , please Your Majesties and Royal Highnesses . ''
`` Is it possible ? ''
the Queen murmured feebly , gazing around at the kneeling group .
`` Is it possible ? ''
She could not believe her senses .
`` Had n't we better get up ? ''
said the Crown Prince , at last .
`` Not at that Traitor 's bidding , '' said Her Majesty , pointing fiercely at Daffodil .
`` It 's very awkward , '' muttered the Crown Prince .
`` I have thought of a plan , '' the Queen exclaimed presently .
`` She had better tell us to stay as we are . ''
`` I will , Your Majesty , with pleasure , if that will enable you to get up : but indeed I never thought of bidding you get up , I only hoped you would , '' said Daffodil .
`` Do you not think that , after that expression of submission from the Traitor , we can , without derogation , get off our knees ? ''
Queen Raucacoäxine asked her family .
And , as all expressed assent , except the King , who did not feel it necessary to trouble himself with deciding details , she gave the command to rise , and dragged up the King .
`` Now , we can not let you waste our time any longer '' said the Queen to Daffodil .
`` Things must go on .
You will be executed in a little while - you see , we are forced to wait to make some necessary arrangements , but they will only take a couple of hours or so . ''
`` I claim a trial , '' replied Daffodil .
`` If you put me to death without a trial , you will be murdering me . ''
`` Of course you can have a trial if you like .
page : 322 What are you making a fuss about ? ''
said the Queen , surprised .
`` If I am tried fairly by your laws , I suppose I must n't complain .
But , if your laws were to condemn a person to death because she wo n't marry a frog , they would be very unjust '' said Daffodil .
`` You are unreasonable , Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , '' returned the Queen coldly .
`` Everything that was possible , and a great deal more , has been done to save you from your own obstinacy .
If you can not be obedient , at least be grateful . ''
Croässaquagha and the Regius Professor of Everything had been standing motionless behind Her Majesty , not venturing to put themselves on a fellowship with the Royal Family by kneeling with them .
The Queen now turned to Croässaquagha .
`` Private Under-Princess and Her Grandeur , you are , of course , aware that , on the death of the present Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , you can again be appointed to your former office and be made eligible for the wedding which takes place to-day .
It will be necessary that His Royal Highness Prince Brekekex should accept you .
You had better be preparing for your high destiny . ''
Croässaquagha became hysterical .
`` Oh , what honour !
what joy !
Oh poor Daffodil !
Oh , what can I say ? ''
she cried .
`` I am not aware that you need say anything , '' said the Queen .
`` I do n't know what to do but obey , '' said Brekekex .
`` And I 'm sure , Croässaquagha , I 've nothing to object to you , and in fact I like you quite as much as Daffodil , all but your not being page : 323 such a wonder at rhymes .
But poor Daffodil !
Oh dear to have her and all the rhymes go to the Boa Constrictor !
Ca n't you change your mind , Daffodil , dear ? ''
Daffodil replied still resolute , though her voice was husky and she trembled .
And Brekekex , without waiting to ask leave to go , and forgetting his illness , rushed from the room , sobbing in his grief for her .
The Queen sent the Crown Prince himself to order the Officer in Command to come with a guard to march off the Traitor to the State Prison .
The Regius Professor of Everything she bade go and ascertain from the Head Royal Physician whether he could make the inspection of the State Boa Constrictor customary before an execution without risk of giving it the infection of his illness .
The Ambassador from Grachidichika , who was at hand waiting to join the wedding procession , for which he had been summoned directly the Queen had heard of the lilies ablow , was called in to be instructed of the necessity for the Matrimonial State of Grachidichika being duly represented by witness at the execution : Grachidichika claimed the right of always having an ambassador present at state executions connected with its affairs , and on this occasion the omission of the custom could not be contemplated , since the disappearance of the present Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica was a vital matter for Grachidichika , as affecting the legality of Croässaquagha 's marriage to its Heir Apparent .
`` The Royal Wedding Procession can lawfully start the moment the present Dressmaker Plenipotentiary has had the sentence pronounced on her , as she will page : 324 then be next thing to executed , '' said the Queen .
`` The moment she is executed , a messenger must be sent , in haste , to me .
I will at once make Croässaquagha Dressmaker Plenipotentiary and she will then be eligible to pass into the Cathedral as Brekekex 's wife . ''
`` Oh do n't let me hear it at all , '' cried Croässaquagha , and fled as Brekekex had done .
But Daffodil had to wait till she was fetched by the guard , and she heard all and saw that , though there was not one of the Royal Family , King and Queen and all , who did not regret the occurrence , her doom was now looked on as inevitable .
Yet she fancied there was still a gleam of hope , for there was her Trial to come , and she thought she might just possibly persuade the Jury and the Judges not to condemn her for High Treason .
page : 325 CHAPTER XXII .
`` I AM to wait for your Pre-eminence '' said the Officer in Command , as he made his salutations to Daffodil after consigning her to the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` Oh thank you  but I do not need you , '' she returned politely .
`` Not just this moment , '' said the Officer In Command .
`` But soon . ''
`` Do you mean that you are to take me away ? ''
He nodded his head mournfully .
`` Ah ! ''
he said , `` if a Croäxaxican soldier might regret anybody 's being a condemned traitor , I should have that inconceivable feeling in escorting you to execution . ''
`` It is very kind of you to say so .
And I will hope it wo n't come to your escorting me to that , '' she answered , speaking more hopefully than she really felt , in order to encourage herself .
The Officer in Command stared at her with a surprise which chilled her heart , and found not a word to answer her .
Disconcerted , she passed on under the escort of the Lieutenant of the State Prison , whose courtesy assumed a still more doleful air than that of the Officer in Command .
page : 326 `` I am sorry to trouble you by coming to stay here for a third time , '' she said , as he led her to a seat in the too familiar room .
`` Ah , Pre-eminent Madam , the trouble is little , and will , most unfortunately , not last for long , '' he replied in a tone of commiseration .
Something seemed choking her .
But she retained her self-command , and presently she was able to speak .
She felt a longing to be left to herself , and she asked `` May I be alone a little while ?
It is very kind of you to stay with me  only , perhaps I shall be able to think better if no one is by . ''
`` I could put some one else to attend you , '' he said .
`` But a prisoner about to pay the penalty for High Treason is not allowed to be left alone in these last moments , because once a prisoner awaiting execution found means to swallow a poison which , though it had not time to destroy him and defeat justice , damaged the Boa Constrictor 's health for a long while .
There is a female warder on duty in your inner room  and I will summon one here and withdraw , if you prefer it . ''
`` I would rather have you , if you do n't mind , '' she said , `` It feels more friendly .
Only , you wo n't think me rude , will you , please , if I do n't talk .
You see I must think over what I ought to say at the trial to defend myself .
I suppose your High Treason prisoners have to speak for themselves as the other sort of prisoners do in Croäxaxica . ''
`` Of course all sorts of prisoners speak for themselves '' was the reply .
`` Who should do it for them ?
They must know more about what they have done than any one else . ''
page : 327 `` But lawyers can make better excuses , '' said Daffodil .
`` Croäxaxicans do not require excuses , '' said the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` Not if they have committed some offence and got put into prison and tried ? ''
she asked convincingly .
`` I do not see the bearing of your remarks , '' replied the Lieutenant of the State Prison , as soon as he had got over a slight cough .
`` But your Preeminence need not be anxious about your trial .
In a case like yours there can be no necessity of the State that the ordeal of a trial should be inflicted on you , and you have simply to decline it when the choice of having it or not is offered you , according to the form . ''
`` Not be tried ! ''
she exclaimed .
`` Not be tried !
But I ca n't quietly let myself be killed without even a trial . ''
The Lieutenant of the State Prison seemed puzzled .
`` Such a ceremonial does certainly add an imposing dignity to the High Traitor 's position , and I can sympathise with your preference although , from the customary depression of spirits , High Traitors do not as a rule desire the fatigue , and there have been complaints on their part in cases where the State , for reasons of its own , required it of them .
Still there are historical instances of High Traitors of exalted spirit requiring the demonstration and rejoicing in it .
But I thought you would prefer quiet : and your mind seemed fretted by the trial , as if you thought it an indispensable addition to the disagreeable event of the day .
Do I understand that your Pre-eminence intends to elect to be tried ? ''
page : 328 `` I will certainly take my last chance , '' replied Daffodil .
`` Chance ? ''
the Lieutenant of the State Prison repeated after her , in an inquiring and perplexed manner .
`` Why ! ''
said she indignantly , `` Is it not a chance ?
Do you mean that your judges and juries are so wicked and cruel that they never acquit a prisoner ? ''
`` But yours would be for High Treason , your Pre-eminence , '' he answered .
`` Never mind , '' said Daffodil .
`` Perhaps they will be fair for once . ''
And the Lieutenant of the State Prison remained pondering over what she could mean .
In a little while came a Royal Herald at the head of a train of Royal Under-Heralds , all in the full insignia of office .
The Royal Herald summoned her , in a set form of very long words which kept coming over and over again , to choose whether she would be executed with or without a trial .
But , just as she rose to answer , there was a confusion and whispering , and it turned out that the Queen had sent a private letter which ought to have been given her first .
So the Royal Herald begged her to consent to consider that he had not yet appeared before her , and to allow him to withdraw for a few minutes and come in and say it all again .
He gave the Lieutenant of the State Prison the Queen 's letter to deliver , and the last of the Under-Heralds as he past before her put into her hands , with some trepidation , another smaller letter , saying as he did so , `` From His Royal Highness Prince Brekekex , '' page : 329 and then , as if conscious of a breach of rules which needed excuse , repeating several times to those round him , `` Prince Brekekex himself told me I must do it . ''
`` I am compelled to require to open the letter which has been put into your hands , even though it is from His Royal Highness Prince Brekekex , '' said the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` Since His Royal Highness knows that it is a duty of my office I dare not neglect , he will have foreseen my opening it . ''
`` If you are sure of that , I will not resist your taking the letter , '' she said .
`` But stop : what would you do if Prince Brekekex had written anything that would make the Queen or anybody angry ? ''
`` It would not be my duty to report anything in a letter from His Royal Highness unless it were a plan for your escape , and I am not apprehensive of finding that in it , not only because he knows I must see the letter , but because your escape is inconceivably impossible , so that he could not suggest it . ''
She had known that an escape was out of the question , yet this was a hard hearing .
The Queen 's letter asked Daffodil whether she really could have been serious in declaring she wanted a trial .
A trial , Her Majesty wrote , would cause great inconvenience and trouble at a very critical moment for the Royal Family of Croäxaxica and the Kingdom of Grachidichika , and could only be a distressing fatigue to Daffodil herself .
Did not Daffodil think it would be better for all parties that she should not protract Prince Brekekex 's sus - page : 330 pense as to his marriage and inheritance and protract , too , her own discomfort , by the vexatious ceremony of a trial .
`` Very good , '' observed the Lieutenant of the State Prison when he had , at Daffodil 's request , read the letter aloud , `` Her Majesty writes with her usual wisdom .
With consummate wisdom I may say , for she expresses precisely my opinion .
Of course you will now elect to be executed without a trial .
Shall I call in the heralds ? ''
`` Perhaps Prince Brekekex has said something about it in the letter you took from me , '' said Daffodil .
The letter was found to be signed by both Brekekex and Croässaquagha .
It ran `` Be sure to elect for a trial .
Pray claim extra jurors for being betrothed to a Royal Prince . ''
`` It is high-minded advice , '' said the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` I see they know you think more of ambition than of comfort . ''
`` What does it mean about extra jurors ? ''
she inquired .
`` Simply to make up twelve . ''
`` But everybody has twelve , I thought . ''
`` Of course  but there is the difference in counting them , you know . ''
She did not know , and he explained that , as the jury must consist of twelve of the prisoner 's peers and , in the case of prisoners of exalted rank , finding twelve persons precisely their peers was not feasible , the rule was to count a given number as equal to one peer .
A Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , the highest minister of the state , would have three persons of the Croäxaxican middle class counted as one juror , page : 331 a person of Royal Blood would have six , and a Royal Prince or Princess ten .
What proportion might be calculated for herself , as betrothed to a Royal Prince , he could not tell .
`` I do n't care about the jurors being my peers  but I suppose Prince Brekekex and the Private Under-Princess think I shall have more chance with more of them , '' Daffodil said meditatively .
`` That can not be , '' replied the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` I do n't quite like it , '' she said , `` because I have never consented to be betrothed to Prince Brekekex . ''
Then a thought struck her .
`` As they make a point of my claiming extra jurors , I will do it as having been engaged to King Grenoulcrawk - I did agree to that , though I made him break it off . ''
The heralds came in again , and , when the citation had been said over again , Daffodil replied , `` I elect to be tried .
And I claim extra jurors because I was engaged to King Grenoulcrawk . ''
But these words did not do and she was required to say what she wanted in a long declaration full of set phrases such as the Royal Herald had used .
There was some difficulty in getting it right , as her claim was a novel one and therefore there was not an exact formula for it .
And a new document had to be made out , as neither of the two brought for her to choose between for signature - the one asking a trial or the one declining it - would do for her answer .
The Royal Herald and his Under Royal Heralds had not had time to depart when the Officer in Command entered and , after formally producing to page : 332 the Lieutenant of the State Prison the Royal Warrant for the removal of the prisoner , informed Daffodil that she must accompany him at once : Her Majesty , growing uneasy at the time that was being lost , had sent orders that the High Traitor was to be taken at once to the Royal Justice House , where orders would be sent whether she was to pass through a trial or to have a quiet execution .
`` She is in a great hurry , '' said Daffodil , indignantly .
`` It is on Prince Brekekex 's account : the King of Grachidichika is getting worse rapidly , '' the Officer in Command explained , to soothe her .
Queen Raucacoäxine 's attempt to save time came to nothing .
Daffodil was promptly conducted to the Royal Justice House , but she had to be kept there in the High Traitor 's Waiting-Room for more than two hours .
This came of the claim for extra jurors .
There was no precedent for Daffodil 's case , and the discussion on it therefore was long .
everybody , and especially Her Majesty herself , changing opinion a dozen times .
It became agreed that , as the interrupted marriage ceremony was taking place while Grenoulcrawk had abdicated and the engagement beforehand had been rejected by Daffodil herself , she need not be considered to have been engaged to King Grenoulcrawk at all  and her claim said nothing about a temporary Prince Grenoulcrawk .
But the decision that the jurors must be more for her than if for a Dressmaker Plenipotentiary not magnified by betrothal to a Royal Prince was finally arrived at owing to the urgency of Prince Brekekex , who , although he had had leave to remain page : 333 in seclusion and attend to getting cured , made his appearance to protest against the disparagement to his Royal Princeship and Heir-Apparentship to a Kingdom that would be involved in treating a person betrothed to him as merely the highest minister of the State .
`` It is too true , '' said the Queen .
`` The dignity of Royalty would suffer in the person of my son Prince Brekekex .
My magnanimous and truly Royal-minded son would risk the loss of his own crown rather than allow that catastrophe .
He is right .
She must have more jurors . ''
But the deciding the number was a new perplexity .
Prince Brekekex said the number must be calculated as for a Royal Princess , the Crown Prince said that was too much - the separation between Royalty and subject rank must not be allowed to be thought no greater than a mere betrothal could abolish , and he considered they could not do more than give her the same proportion of persons to a juror as if she had been akin to Royalty by blood .
The Queen wavered , but inclined to the Crown Prince 's view .
`` The point is so knotty '' said the Regius Professor of Everything , who had been sent for , `` that I should suggest an adjournment of the decision , were it not for the danger of delay . ''
`` Of course , '' said the Queen .
`` The danger of delay .
We must get on !
If time goes so , we sha n't get any marriage done while Grenoulcrawk still keeps alive .
I decide to give Brekekex his way and let her have jurors for a Royal Younger Princess , rather than go on discussing .
That 'll be ten persons to a juror . ''
page : 334 `` I do n't want too much delay '' said Prince Brekekex , turning pale at the thought .
`` I agree to the jurors for Royal Kin .
That 'll be six persons to a juror . ''
`` Then I decide that way , '' said the Queen .
`` And I only wish Brekekex had been so sensible sooner . ''
And now messengers dashed in all directions .
Jurors , seventy-two to the dozen , were got together  judges , in due relation to the rank indicated by the number of jurors , were hurried to their seats .
The prisoner was shouted for by seventy-two heralds-one to each juryman .
The heralds should have shouted each separately , but , time being so precious , the Queen had commanded in the King 's name that on this occasion their all shouting simultaneously should be considered their doing it one after the other .
Daffodil , walking between the Lieutenant of the State Prison and the Officer in Command and guarded by seventy-two soldiers , entered the Trial Hall .
It was a tremendously long room , or rather gallery , sombrely hung with dark green moss and water-flags of a purplish crimson .
Down the centre of the gallery were ranged , at twelve equal distances from each other , a hundred and twenty pairs of seats , face to face , with five feet between them - each pair standing on a circular plot of earth of ten feet diameter surrounded by a band of water about a yard wide .
Seventy-two respectable Croäxaxicans of sleepy appearance were seated in a line , each in one of a pair of seats .
The seventy-two heralds , issuing from the Hall where the Judges sat , marched along the gallery to meet the prisoner with her page : 335 escort where they had paused in the entrance .
There were no other persons in the Hall .
`` Where are the judges ? ''
whispered Daffodil to the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` Waiting for you , '' he whispered back .
`` Where do the witnesses stand ? ''
`` All the jurors are for witnesses , if your heirs want any hereafter . ''
`` There is no public . ''
`` Surely there is !
Seventy-two jurors sitting there , and every one a mere member of the public . ''
Daffodil did not find these answers very clear to her intelligence , but she asked no more .
Things would explain themselves , she thought .
When the heralds had reached where she stood , they asked the Lieutenant of the State Prison who she was , and , on his reply , each of them in turn performed the customary reverential exercise of hopping round , and saluted her by her name and title .
This ceremony was shortened in the same way in which the summoning the prisoner to appear had been  the heralds were considered to have questioned the Lieutenant of the State Prison consecutively and to have received each a separate answer , but they in fact took the unusual course of addressing him in unison and receiving together his one answer .
But now the ceremony reached a stage which could not be curtailed .
Preceded by the heralds , led by the Lieutenant of the State Prison , and followed by the seventy-two soldiers , Daffodil advanced towards the island of the nearest juror .
Here her escort formed into circles outside the stream , the heralds in the inner circle the soldiers in page : 336 the outer .
The Officer in Command remained with his troop , a herald walked by Daffodil on the side where he had been , and on the other side the Lieutenant of the State Prison still led her by the hand .
She was placed in the seat facing the juror .
There the herald cried out that this was Daffodil , Her Pre-eminence the Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica , by Royal Sentence for High Treason , on her way to the State Boa Constrictor .
Thereupon the juror drew forth a huge pair of official spectacles , supplied him for the purpose , and gazed steadily at her , solemn silence prevailing .
`` I have seen her , '' the juror said .
`` Juror Number One has seen her , '' shouted the herald beside her to the other heralds , and they all shouted together `` Juror Number One has seen her . ''
The juror rose , saluted Daffodil by name and title , and performed the hoppings round - three in number in virtue of the honours due to Royal Blood which had been accorded her .
When these were finished , the Lieutenant of the State Prison , observing that Daffodil remained motionless , whispered to her that it was necessary to show deference to the majesty of the law , in the person of the juryman , by hopping round .
She rose in haste , ashamed to have been discourteous , and would have hopped round more than once but that the Lieutenant of the State Prison and the juryman himself stopped her abruptly by a shout to forbear .
It would have been an outrage on decency if she had commenced a second round  but she had scarcely comprehended that she was now on the same footing as one really of Royal Blood .
page : 337 The presentation to the first juror being over , the prisoner had to be led in exactly the same manner to the second , a second herald taking the place of him who had just served his turn .
She was again introduced as on her way to the Boa Constrictor , again stared at through jurorical spectacles , again declared to have been seen , and again saluted by name and title and revered with three hoppings round .
Of course she took care not to repeat her mistake , and confined her courtesy to the due once round .
The same ceremonies were repeated with the third juror , with the fourth , the fifth , the sixth , with every juror till the whole seventy-two were passed .
Long before they had got to the last juror Daffodil was thoroughly tired .
`` I am fagged to death , '' she said , confidentially , to the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
`` I am so glad , '' he replied with friendly alacrity .
`` Now you will know the value of my advice .
I should have been sorry if you had died thinking me mistaken . ''
`` I know you advised kindly , '' she said .
`` But how could I throw away my only chance left ? ''
`` I ca n't see how you make out that you get a chance out of a trial , '' returned the Lieutenant of the State Prison .
But , as they had arrived at the enclosure of another juror , they could not continue their discussion .
When Daffodil 's presentation to the seventy-second juror had been duly completed , the Heralds blew a mighty blast through their flower-tubes , rushed in a body to the door of the Hall of Condemnation , which was at the end of the Trial Hall , page : 338 and shouted out to the seventy-two ushers who had advanced to meet them `` The Trial is over  '' which the ushers immediately shouted to the Judges .
In this matter again there was a compression of the usual form , and every one of the seventy-two heralds and seventy-two ushers had to be considered to have shouted separately in his turn .
There would by this time have been still more compressions used , had it been possible without disturbing the Croäxaxican Constitution  for the news from Grachidichika , which was being brought by minute-ly relays of messengers , had now aroused the utmost consternation .
There appeared scarcely a hope that King Grenoulcrawk could breathe on till sentence was pronounced  and , even if he did that , it would be of no use if the execution , Croässaquagha 's nomination to the vacated post of Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , and the bridal pair 's entering the cathedral , had not taken place while he survived .
Within the Hall of Condemnation a small chorus of voices - which were those of the Judges - replied loudly and solemnly , `` The High Traitor has leave to come in , '' and then somebody - it was the Head Judge - said to somebody , in a lower voice , `` Have her brought quickly : most likely it 's too late already . ''
The ushers shouted so fast they nearly choked themselves for want of breath , and so did the heralds .
`` The High Traitor has leave to come in , have her brought quickly , most likely it 's too late already , '' was what the ushers shouted to the heralds and the heralds repeated .
And that did not do  so the Judges had to give the order again `` The High Traitor has leave to come in , '' and the ushers and heralds had to shout it again .
page : 339 The moment this had been done , Daffodil found herself flying like a shuttlecock from herald to herald and from usher to usher , so zealous were all in carrying out the urgent Royal orders for not wasting time which had been circulated among them .
The next thing , she was alone on a raised platform in front of the Judges .
The Judges were ranged on a dais at a lower level than the structure which had been piled up for her , the kinship to Royalty accorded to her requiring the superior elevation of her position before them .
They were eleven in number - ten were indispensable for pronouncing the sentence upon a High Traitor of this distinction , and , if there had not been one over , the Head Judge could not have sat in the middle .
They were all robed in the Royal green and orange colours , and they wore huge snail-shells on their heads , which gave them an impressive and competent appearance .
But Daffodil was not able to contemplate them : she had not had a moment 's time to collect her senses after her hurried entrance when the Head Judge began and all the others recited after him `` WE PRONOUNCE THE SENTENCE PASSED BY THEIR MAJESTIES ON HER AKIN TO ROYALTY AND EXALTED PRE-EMINENCE DAFFODIL , DRESSMAKER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF CROƒXAXICA . ''
The seventy-two heralds , although they had not all of them had time to get into the Hall of Condemnation , blew the Condemning Flourish as solemnly as they possibly could under the difficulty of having to perform it in double quick time instead of with the extreme slowness properly belonging to it .
When they had finished and all had become so still page : 340 that people could hear their own breaths , the ushers shouted in tremendous tones `` Silence !
Their Learnednesses are about to pronounce the sentence .
Silence !
Silence !
Silence ! ''
`` May I speak ? ''
asked Daffodil , who had now collected her senses .
`` Speak !
when the Judges are pronouncing the Sentence ! ''
exclaimed the Head Judge , while the other Judges gave vent to ejaculations , and clucks and sighs and gasps expressed the difficultly restrained amazement of the ushers and heralds .
`` But , even if there is to be no inquiry into the charges against me , wo n't you hear my defence ? ''
she urged .
`` There are no charges , and there can be no defence , '' said the Head Judge .
`` All this interruption is wholly without precedent .
Pray do not again interpose these unseemly delays .
Now we have to begin it all afresh . ''
And the Judges recited again their declaration that they were going to pronounce the sentence , the heralds blew again the Condemning Flourish , and the ushers shouted again `` Silence !
Their Learnednesses are about to pronounce the Sentence .
Silence !
Silence !
Silence ! ''
At this point the Judges took up an immense document on which there stood in enormous letters .
`` THE HIGH TRAITOR IS TO BE DEVOURED AT ONCE BY THE STATE BOA CONSTRICTOR . ''
They held it up among them for every one to see , and they read it out together in the loudest possible tones .
`` Sentence is pronounced , '' shouted the ushers .
The heralds blew the After Condemnation Flourish , page : 341 and scurried off to repeat it outside the Royal Justice House , where it would have been the signal for the departure of Prince Brekekex 's wedding procession , but that the swiftest leaper in Croäxaxica had been put on duty as one of the ushers , in order that he might hie with notice of the pronouncing the sentence the moment the last word had passed the Judges ' lips , and so great had been his speed and the alacrity of the procession that the start was made a full minute before the Heralds could begin their proclaiming blast .
Daffodil , who would have repeated her efforts for a hearing before the sentence , had been stopped by the Head Usher 's pouring water into her throat .
She had to gulp it down , and meanwhile the Judges had read out the decree .
All was over , but she could not believe it .
`` My Lords Judges !
My Lords Judges ! ''
she cried out , as the Judges sprang up in a hurry to run after the Royal Wedding Procession , `` You ca n't leave me condemned in this way , and not even a word of mercy . ''
But the last of the Judges was disappearing through the portal , with the ushers beginning to throng after him , by the time she had got so far .
And there had come suddenly and swiftly , from a low narrow opening at the farther end of the Hall , seventy-two dark figures draped from head to foot in the purple-black poppies which form Croäxaxican mourning garb - nothing of even their faces being visible but the eyes peering through slits in the folds .
Another moment and they had surrounded her and were bearing her away .
She tried to struggle , but they held her motionless  she tried page : 342 to cry out , but they laid their cold hands on her mouth .
The passage along which she was carried slanted sharply downwards through solid stone and earth , and entered a rugged natural tunnel which presently widened and heightened into a rock-chamber thickly hung with stalactites of fantastic shapes .
When she was set down in this vast chamber , she saw at first nothing but the strange fretwork and pillars and likenesses of incongruous things , bright with a varying rosy flicker from a light out of view , and , in a far-off niche , the dim figure of some one seated .
But two of the executioners led her on , and behold a huge recess fenced in by a sheet of clear water through which there shot and glimmered from behind a flame-like tide and spray , and in the recess , behind the transparent barrier , the monstrous outstretched length of the State Boa Constrictor !
The Head Royal Executioner turned to the seated person in the niche , `` Your High Investigatorship the Witness for Grachidichika , behold the High Traitor to Croäxaxica and danger to Grachidichika we are , according to Royal Sentence duly pronounced by the Judges , about to consign to the State Boa Constrictor , '' he cried in a sonorous voice that set a thousand echoes ringing .
This was the prescribed formula at the execution of any State prisoner in any way connected with the Kingdom of Grachidichika .
No sooner had the Head Royal Executioner pronounced it than he said `` Now ! ''
and all the executioners rushed off , hurrying Daffodil amid them up a steep corridor into a room above the Boa Constrictor 's cage .
The seventy-two heralds page : 343 were gathered there  and there too , that moment arrived from the Queen to hurry matters if possible , were the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician , shivering with anxiety , for the issue to Prince Brekekex and the Kingdom of Grachidichika hung on a breath - if indeed all were not already over .
Word had come that King Grenoulcrawk was at his last gasp .
Daffodil caught one glimpse of her friends ' faces .
Then , before she could know what was happening , she was in a seat suspended over a latticed orifice , the lattice was suddenly removed , the executioners sprang back in fright lest , even from the depth he lay below them , the snake should spring and reach to them , the seat was swiftly lowered into the dreadful opening , the lattice dropped back into its place .
`` Daffodil , Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica , has perished for her crimes , '' cried the Head Royal Executioner solemnly .
The Royal Heralds shouted `` Daffodil , Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica , has perished for her crimes , '' and , with the shout still on their lips , ran again to the outer court of the Royal Justice Hall to give the great funereal blast that announces the end of a traitor .
Scarcely had the opening notes rung out when they were answered by the joyful blare of the Royal Wedding Trumpets and the cheers of the populace as the bridal pair passed into the Cathedral in marriage .
And then there mingled with the sounds the loud slow thuds of water-claps from Grachidichika proclaiming a King 's death .
Brekekex and Croässaquagha were King and Queen of Grachidichika .
page : 344 CHAPTER XXIII .
THE fatiguing and protracted ceremonial of the Trial By Jury which Daffodil had , unaware of its nature , inflicted on herself , had made the despatch of her condemnation and execution , bewildering as it would have been at any rate to her unprepared mind , yet more bewildering .
She had scarcely been able to feel that it was really her own sentence of death that was being pronounced , that was being carried into effect .
All had been to her a confusion and a whirlwind , and it was as if in a dream that she passed into the stillness of the end .
Her seat , descending at violent speed , touched the ground with a jerk , she fell forward on something soft and slippery , and knew that she lay on the very creature whose prey she was to be  but the shock was too great for conscious terror , she was stupefied .
In a few minutes she became very much surprised that she still existed , and then , encouraged by nothing happening , she got off the Boa Constrictor and wondered if it would let her alone long .
It lay outstretched between her and the water-barrier , as if to cut off the possibility of her egress , but it seemed not to be thinking about her  it did not so much as page : 345 turn its head , lying indeed so inert , and looking so much the same swollen bulk all along its expanse , that she could not tell which end was its head .
She would have thought it a stuffed serpent skin but that it panted heavily and its breathing sounded like snores .
When some time had passed and still the Boa Constrictor showed no signs of stirring , Daffodil began to ponder over the desirability of trying to stride over it and run out through the water-barrier .
Her main fear , of course , was that it would at once arouse itself and seize her into its crushing coils : and she did not know , after all , that she should gain much by getting out of its cage  for what was to prevent its pursuing her ?
As to the getting out of the cage into the open part of the rock-chamber , she saw no difficulty in that for either herself or the snake  there was evidently no separation but the two waterfalls , the red one which was in front of her , brightening and fading till it seemed almost fire instead of water , and the clear white one she knew to be beyond it .
But whether , even if the Boa would let her , she could flee from the rock-chamber she did not know : it might now be closed or guarded .
And how , if she did get out of the rock-chamber , to escape from the Royal Justice Hall and its precincts , and where to turn for a final refuge , were matters past all calculation .
`` I can but try , '' she said , speaking aloud to give herself the more cheer .
At the sound of her voice the Boa made a cumbrous movement , as if to turn at one end - the end which , it was thus made apparent to her , was its head - but it gave it up and lay outspread again .
page : 346 With her mind made up to the venture , Daffodil remained some time waiting , as she hoped , for the Boa to have relapsed into his disregard of her .
And , as she gazed through the water , she became aware of a figure still seated in the niche , face fixed towards her .
The Witness for Grachidichika was continuing at his post .
Faint as her hopes had been , this sudden disappointment of them was too much , and she burst into irrepressible sobs .
Again the Boa 's head began to turn  but again it relapsed into straightness and quiet .
After much reflection , Daffodil resolved to try the desperate venture of escaping in the sight of the Witness .
He , like the Boa Constrictor , seemed of a sedate habit of body , so that perhaps she might rush past him and be she did n't know where before he could interfere .
If that failed , she would throw herself on his mercy and so beseech him that he must wish to spare her if he could .
She nerved herself for a supreme effort , and sprang over the Boa Constrictor .
The monster just twisted his head and gazed at her  he might have been paralysed for any sign of pursuit he gave .
She flew towards the unsubstantial barrier , but , ere she could touch it , she stopped by a sudden constraint .
A slight but firm tether fastened round her waist was secured to the seat in which she was sent down , and made her fast prisoner within the Boa 's cage .
She could not break the tether nor undo it  she had no means of severing it .
Yet it seemed impossible that a little twist of fibres and fish-bones was to deprive her of her last hopes of life .
She sat down on a smooth corner of rock , and tried per - page : 347 severingly to gnaw the bond asunder .
She made little way in her attempt , but the occupation at least enabled her to bear the suspense of her situation , and what barely perceptible progress she did make was proof that her final success was only a question of the duration of her opportunity for the work and her power of endurance of the starvation which threatened her if , now that she was considered to have perished , she continued to live .
The duration of her opportunity was , however , not to be reckoned on .
The snake might continue pacific , she began to count upon it that it would  but there was the Witness for Grachidichika .
Even if he did not frustrate her purpose , his presence made it probable that attendants of some sort would enter the rock-chamber : they would have to escort him thence , or at the least to bring him food , and he had now sat there so long that she feared their arrival at every moment .
Hours wore on , however , and she was still unmolested , nibbling at the cord , which at last was visibly fretted where her teeth had been .
She was not afraid now of the Boa  it had once or twice curved its head round sufficiently to gaze at her with a deeply mournful resignation which moved her to pity .
Obviously the poor thing could not eat her .
`` It 's very hard for you , you unhappy creature , '' she said sympathisingly , `` after you 've been starving so long , to be tantalised with me , when no doubt you can only eat Croäxaxicans and Grachidichikans .
Poor sorrowful old fellow !
But what can I do for you ?
I could n't make myself nice for you , even if I did n't want to escape . ''
And the Boa Constrictor looked at her piteously , as if it understood , and big tears rolled from its eyes .
page : 348 `` It will get over its distaste to me , '' flashed suddenly into her mind with renewed apprehension .
But she saw it close its eyes in a lethargic snooze , and felt sure that for the present she was preserved from its appetite .
And at last , for it was past bedtime and the Boa Constrictor 's snoring made her overpoweringly drowsy , she succumbed unawares to her fatigue and dropped sound asleep .
She was awakened in the middle of the night by voices calling her .
`` Heigh-ho My !
Can the Boa have taken her after all ? ''
exclaimed some one , in a startled tone .
Some one replied - could it be Croässaquagha ?
- `` No  there she is , fallen asleep on the ground . ''
She roused herself with an effort and asked `` Who wants me ? ''
`` We do , '' cried Brekekex , Croässaquagha , the Regius Professor of Everything , the Head Royal Physician , and Number Seventy Seven And A Half .
She rubbed her eyes , and saw them all standing at the other side of the water-barrier .
`` Does the Boa Constrictor stir much ? ''
asked Brekekex `` A little more than it did , '' Daffodil replied .
For , disturbed by the voices , it had lifted its head from the ground and , twisting it towards her more promptly than hitherto , was gazing at her with pensive yearning .
`` Oh well , then , we wo n't come in , thank you , '' said Brekekex .
`` You must manage to saw through the tether yourself .
Catch this . ''
And he threw her an implement such as the Croäxaxicans use for sawing through their ropes .
`` Some of us might help her , '' said Croässaquagha .
page : 349 `` It 's not a masculine sort of danger , '' replied her husband .
`` Of course if it were I would face it myself , as Your Majesty knows . ''
`` Of course you would , my dear noble Your Majesty , '' said Croässaquagha enthusiastically .
`` But I 'll go in to help her .
And Seventy Seven And A Half may come with me . ''
`` Oh please , no , '' cried the Under Royal Wardrobe-maid , `` I should scream if I went near the Boa , I 'm quite sure . ''
`` No , no ! ''
said Brekekex firmly .
`` A wife 's place in danger is under her husband 's shelter .
Your Majesty ca n't go in .
The Regius Professor and the Head Royal Physician may help Daffodil . ''
But the Regius Professor and the Head Royal Physician hesitated .
`` There is positively no risk , '' said King Brekekex .
`` Never mind anybody coming in to help me , '' interposed Daffodil .
`` It would n't be a comfortable experiment  and I am getting on capitally - the cord will soon be sawn through . ''
In a little while she was freed of her tether .
`` What shall I do now ? ''
she asked .
`` Come out , '' was the reply .
In fact she had merely to advance and be in safety among her rescuers .
Their chatter of delight drowned her fervent words of thanks , and covered the silence of her religious gratitude .
But presently alarm revived in her .
The Boa Constrictor was making a slight writhing , and regarding her with manifest emotion .
`` Look ! ''
she exclaimed , catching King Brekekex 's arm .
`` It will follow me . ''
They all burst out laughing at her panic .
`` Well !
page : 350 You are easily frightened ! ''
said King Brekekex .
`` Why , where do you think it would get out of its cage ? ''
Daffodil had not known that the flame-like water through which she moved so easily was to the Boa Constrictor an impassable barrier  rather than touch it , or even approach it closely , it would have let itself be killed in agonies .
`` But it ca n't move now , even inside its cage , '' said Brekekex triumphantly .
`` It is filled too full .
It wo n't be able to crawl for days .
Was n't it a splendid idea ? ''
`` Ah , my generous Your Majesty , do not rate my humble , though singular , imaginativeness too highly , '' said Croässaquagha diffidently .
`` Ah !
to be sure - it was Your Majesty that proposed the trial and the mushrooms , '' said Brekekex .
`` But it was I that thought of our finding out some plan to save her . ''
`` It was , '' said Croässaquagha .
`` Daffodil , it was .
Thus did my husband 's poetic genius forgive your well-nigh fatal aberration .
Thus did his lofty genius combine with what the too partial world is willing to call my genius too .
He has saved you . ''
`` King Brekekex , stupendous victor , Vanquished even the Boa Constrictor , Made it so swallow , Not one little hollow Was left to hold the perished High Traitor , Whose conduct was strange but he did not hate her , '' recited Brekekex .
`` I have thought of that already , while we have been sitting up waiting for it to be late enough for us to come out without anybody page : 351 being up and awake .
I shall make a splendid poem on the story of all this , and I 'll read it to all of you often - but you will have not to talk of it and go about repeating it for a very long while , or the Queen wo n't forgive us when she hears what we 've done .
Perhaps she wo n't mind so much by and by when other things of some sort or other have happened between . ''
`` I hope no one is in danger for helping me , '' Daffodil said anxiously .
`` Not unless we are found out , '' said Brekekex .
`` And we sha n't be , for no one will ever suspect us , and we are not likely to tell of ourselves . ''
Daffodil was by this time growing faint for want of food .
Croässaquagha observed it .
`` There are still a few mushrooms in the Speaker 's footstool , '' she said to Seventy Seven And A Half .
`` Get them out and give them to Her defunct Pre-eminence . ''
And , while Seventy Seven And A Half was removing a tall hollow stool from under the feet of the Witness for Grachidichika , to get out the mushrooms , Daffodil perceived that he was no other than the Speaker .
`` It is lucky for you that he had to come because of the Ambassador 's being wanted at the wedding , '' she was told in answer to her exclamation of surprise .
And , while she made her much needed meal , they told her of what service he had been to her .
Croässaquagha and Seventy Seven And A Half had secretly repaired to Grachidichika , and , with the assistance of the Head Royal Physician , unsewed the Speaker , removed the material with which he was stuffed , and sewed him up again full of mushrooms brought them by Seventy Seven And A Half 's page : 352 Grachidichikan lover , who was easily persuaded to assist her in a conspiracy under the auspices of the Croäxaxican Prince about to be King of Grachidichika , and whose secrecy was , like Seventy Seven And A Half 's own , secured by the certainty that , even if there were chance of a pardon or a mitigation of punishment for Brekekex and his Queen , there would be no such chance for servants sharing in their offence .
The Speaker 's chair , which had a hollow base , these conspirators heightened , as if to give it more dignity , by placing beneath it a square armless seat which was hollow  the platform on which it was to be carried was also hollow , and so was the footstool : all these they crammed with mushrooms .
Then , when all was ready and Croässaquagha and her attendant had slipped quietly home by backways to Croässaquagha 's retired palace , Brekekex came , himself , with the State Escort from Croäxaxica which was to conduct the Speaker to the Croäxaxican Hall of Justice at the earliest possible moment , in order not to call public attention to the fact of the approaching execution at such a joyous time and to keep his venerable person safe from the jostling of the crowds the expectation of the wedding would presently gather in every canal .
When the Speaker had been placed at his post as Witness for Grachidichika , Prince Brekekex expressed his intention of giving him his company for a while , and , refusing other attendance in this act of courtesy , sent for the Head Royal Physician and the Regius Professor of Everything .
It was usual that these learned personages should inspect the State Boa Constrictor before and after an execution , so there page : 353 was no surprise at the Prince 's desiring their presence  it was supposed that he wished , while , as Heir Apparent of Grachidichika , he displayed a condescending deference to the Speaker by remaining with him , to take the opportunity of observing the creature in their instructive society .
But , when the Prince and the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician were alone with the Speaker and the Boa Constrictor , their conduct was very different from what was supposed .
One of them , by turns , kept watch at the entrance of the rock-chamber , the other two were steadily at work getting out the mushrooms from the Speaker and his appurtenances and giving them to the Boa Constrictor by means of two long poles of joined reeds with bowls at the end of them , which were kept for the purpose of feeding him .
The Boa Constrictor was for some time much pleased .
The time for feeding it , in order to keep it alive for its State duty , was , unless it had a High Traitor within the period , at the expiration of every third year , and they usually gave it mushrooms , which it rather liked .
The three years had almost expired , and it was ravenously hungry .
So it swallowed its welcome meal with satisfaction , and had soon taken in enough to feel agreeably encumbered .
Then it became doubtful at each helping  yet its natural greediness led it to accept what was given it , till it grew so burdened with overfulness that it shut its mouth determinedly .
But they tempted it with a mushroom of such extra size that it could not resist , and then , instead of withdrawing the pole , they managed to keep its mouth page : 354 open with it , and with the other pole they persevered in inserting more and more mushrooms , ramming them down tight into its body so that they could go on packing it as full as its skin could swell to hold , until it was quite stiff and unable to move .
That was why it could not touch Daffodil .
And the reason Brekekex and Croässaquagha had got Daffodil to ask for a trial was that there might be time for thus feeding the Boa Constrictor till it was disabled .
They had had difficulty in setting up the Speaker again .
They had fastened him together and blown into him till he was puffed out enough to pass muster , seated in his niche , but they had been terribly afraid that some chance touch might make him collapse .
And he did collapse now on their moving him .
He was to be Daffodil 's helper still .
The plan for her escape was that she was to be sewn inside him , instead of his stuffing .
She demurred , but there was no other possible way for removing her to safety and concealing that the Boa Constrictor had been fed with something that was not she .
The Speaker was much shorter than Daffodil , and her limbs would not have been sufficiently hidden but that Croässaquagha and Seventy Seven And A Half had carefully arrayed him in extra large robes and a mantle of Royal dimensions which they now arranged and secured so as completely to cover her as she sat in his chair .
The arrangements being completed , her friends withdrew : for day was at hand , and they feared that some one might enter .
at an early hour in the morning Brekekex would page : 355 return with a Guard and retinue which were to escort the Speaker back to Grachidichika .
So , with encouraging words , they left her in the niche  and she was still so weary that she soon fell asleep again .
page : 356 CHAPTER XXIV .
DAFFODIL 'S journey to Grachidichika was accomplished without the least suspicion being aroused , and she was established in the House of Parliament , henceforth her abode .
The private fortune of Croässaquagha enabled the new sovereign to arrange for the maintenance of his Court , Army , and household on a scale slightly less penurious than that of his predecessor , and Croässaquagha was to have an attendant of her own .
With the sanction of the Queen Raucacoäxine .
Seventy Seven And A Half was , for this purpose , to be transferred to the Grachidichikan service , as Head ( and only ) Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - maid and also several other feminine officials - the limits of the Royal purse requiring this multiplication of her .
It was too plain that her presence in the Palace of Grachidichika , to put her long obsolete departments in order before the arrival of the new Queen , was really requisite , for the bridal pair 's request for her being despatched thither at once to meet with any inquiry  and thus she was at hand to provide for Daffodil 's needs .
Her betrothed , nominated for the important posts of Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet , Royal and page : 357 Matrimonial Steward , Prime Minister , and Royal and Matrimonial Private Secretary , assisted her in this duty , which it was not difficult for them to perform unobserved at night or when Parliament was not sitting , and , if some of their visits to the Speaker had been remarked , their official positions would have suggested business for the State as the motive of their interviews .
The mourning for King Grenoulcrawk and the funeral ceremonies , and then the continued course of marriage for King Brekekex and Queen Croässaquagha , caused adjournments of Parliament  and for this Daffodil was glad , as she was relieved from the uncomfortable expectation of the entrance of the member whose day it might be , and from the necessity of sitting rigidly motionless for hours , if he happened to come in an oratorical state of mind .
The new King and Queen visited Parliament in State , on their coming to reside in their Kingdom .
Of course the Speaker had to stand , and it was remarked that he had never within any one 's memory done it so well before - a circumstance which created great confidence in the Prime Minister who had arranged him .
After that occasion Their Majesties ' visits were made in the security of the night  and now and then the Queen herself with Seventy Seven And A Half would unfasten the Speaker and let Daffodil out into complete freedom until it was time for her to be sewn in again .
If there was not leisure enough for this operation , Daffodil could throw off the Speaker 's robes and mantle and substitute for them one of Croässaquagha 's largest heather-bells , which Seventy Seven And A Half would have ready for her .
page : 358 It was not thought prudent for her to come within sight of the inhabited buildings , but she walked about the guggle-gig grounds with her friends - or at times alone , for they could not always come - and she rested in conversation with them in the retired canals .
The Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician were permitted by Queen Raucacoäxine to transgress the rule of the inaccessibility of Grachidichika , providing they were supposed not to do so , and , in their secret visits , they would join the little party at night , and then the meetings in the Private Under-Princess 's home seemed to be renewed .
The first moment Daffodil was with Their Majesties quite alone she had told them she had a secret for them that would give them more than all the wealth of Grachidichika 's vanished days of prosperity .
She led them to poor Queen Chachareraroncaxa 's scarlet , or rather once scarlet , guggle-gigs , and told the story of the waterings with the lighting-water from the Ancient Royal Wardrobe , and the old Queen 's plan for the canal secretly fed by the unfathomed reservoir .
A portion of Croässaquagha 's fortune was to have been expended in renovating the Palace and the Barracks , laying out the faded Royal Garden anew with coloured earth , and either restoring order to the Ancient Royal Wardrobe or ( for Croässaquagha had a whim , in which Daffodil zealously encouraged her , for keeping it in its present half wild state ) in enlarging the little Royal Wardrobe which had served for recent Queens of Grachidichika : it was instantly decided that the money should be spent on obtaining the wealth of the scarlet guggle - page : 359 gigs .
Hundreds of workmen were set next day to digging a wide canal from a reservoir of brackish water of a common sort , which happened to be near the Ancient Royal Wardrobe 's lighting-water reservoir , to the guggle-gig grounds  the grounds were doubled in extent , and , when the great canal was made , it was intersected with a network of little canals making chequers all over them .
People thought it an odd thing King Brekekex should want so much more produce of guggle-gigs and guggle-ooze when he possessed them already in such useless quantity , but they supposed it came somehow from his being a poet , and that explanation set curiosity at rest .
When the workmen had finished all they had to do , and had left Grachidichika , came the carrying out of the secret part of the project .
The three servants on whom Queen Chachareraroncaxa had thought she could rely were easily identified : they were native Grachidichikans of immense age who had never been outside the kingdom , and who possessed not only the hatred to Croäxaxica natural from their never having been there , but an added and unquenchable hatred from their having lived in days when their country still enjoyed a passable revenue from the sale of guggle-gigs and having seen its decay when Croäxaxica had possessed itself of an ample supply of guggle-gigs of its own growing .
They were devoted to the Royal Family of Grachidichika , and the Royal Family , of course , whatever its pedigree and relationships , was considered of pure Grachidichikan blood , but they could never be got to enter into conversation with a Croäxaxican , or a Grachidichikan with Croäxaxican mixture in his veins , or a Grachi - page : 360 dichikan who consorted with Croäxaxicans - a patriotic virtue which limited them to each other for society .
There was no risk of their letting out the secret accidentally , and nothing could have prevailed to make them do so intentionally .
To these was entrusted the task of limiting the quantity of brackish water that could enter the canal , and making an unsuspected tunnel by which a full current from the lighting-water reservoir could unceasingly mingle with it .
Of course , for fear of discovery , they could only work by night  but this enabled King Brekekex , his Queen , and Daffodil to help in the digging and carrying sods and soil  and the operations , which fortunately were of small extent , were finished with speed and success .
Happy indeed was their result for the Matrimonial Royal Family and the Kingdom of Grachidichika !
The scarlet guggle-gigs , the bluish violet guggle-ooze , were found , not only a luxury such as Croäxaxica had never yet known , but cure or preventive for almost every disease , and , above all , potent in the creation of beauty : they fetched prices hitherto undreamed and the King of Grachidichika 's income was counted by millions of millions .
The guggle-gig growers of Croäxaxica tried to raise the scarlet variety : at first they thought all that was needed was to imitate King Brekekex in having small plots and numerous runnels of water , and when , to their surprise , that did not suffice , they tried cuttings from what were sent from Grachidichika for the table , and one wealthy grower even succeeded , by immense bribes , in getting some stolen roots from King Brekekex 's grounds : but nothing they could hit on would do , page : 361 and Grachidichika has never lost its wealth-giving monopoly .
Queen Raucacoäxine was for a while uneasy at the immense accession to the revenue of the Grachidichikan King .
True he was a son of hers and she was proud of him , but , although she had rejoiced when it was found that he would , far unlike poor Grenoulcrawk , have means to rival in Court splendours the most splendid of former Grachidichikan Kings , things wore a changed aspect to her patriotic heart when the increasing demand for his guggle-gigs made him well-nigh able to rival in Court splendours the present Croäxaxican King , her own Royal Husband .
But , on its being agreed that the guggle-gigs imported from Grachidichika should pay such heavy tolls to the Royal Treasury of Croäxaxica as made a very decided addition to its income , she felt that she could indulge in unmixed pleasure at her son 's good fortune .
Daffodil 's own position was made worse by the prosperity she had helped to bring to her Royal friends .
What with increase of the Royal Household staffs , the introduction of separate persons for Court posts , the bringing up the Army to its full complement , and other such changes , the number of the inhabitants of Grachidichika became multiplied several times over : and this , it was found too late , caused the chance of some one seeing her in her walks at night , or passing the House of Parliament while she was stretching herself , to be now a serious risk .
And Brekekex and Croässaquagha were hindered in their intercourse with her both by their engagements of State and of Royal hospitality and by their increasing page : 362 difficulty in escaping observation .
Seventy Seven And A Half ( or , as her title now was , the Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - maid ) and the Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet were able to provide for her requirements still , but as , although their importance was greatly raised , they now each presided over only one Department , they had not the same cover as formerly if they should be observed paying frequent visits to the Speaker , especially as no events of ceremonial moment were at present occurring in Grachidichika : they had to be chary of their coming , and usually to hasten away directly the time for a few formal sentences to the Speaker might be supposed to have elapsed .
Excepting during the sitting of Parliament , Daffodil was very lonely .
The sittings of Parliament , however , only added to her weariness .
They had become greatly prolonged .
The number of members had been trebled to bring it to the ancient Constitutional figure from which it had fallen off and to allow more people to have the honour of the position  it was therefore necessary that three members should divide a day between them instead of only one having it for his speech : this made some of the speeches shorter than they would have been , but there were now more of them , and she lost the respites she had had under the one member a day system .
when sometimes a reticent or pre-occupied member would speak but a few minutes and .
having thus fulfilled his duty , go away , leaving the rest of the Parliamentary hours to pass undisturbed .
One night , when the two trusted attendants had succeeded in getting Daffodil safely into the Ancient Royal Wardrobe , whither no one might follow Queen page : 363 Croässaquagha without her special permission , the Queen was full of talk of her happiness and honours .
`` And Grachidichika , '' she said , `` is the true home for sensitive genius - of genius which declines to abase itself to effort , of genius which has itself for its own end .
Grachidichika is secluded from agitation and demands no exertion . ''
`` But very much doing nothing feels such a waste of time , '' said Daffodil pensively .
`` Oh no , no waste of time for those like you and me , '' exclaimed Croässaquagha , too happy herself to perceive her friend 's melancholy .
`` Not for us the vulgar ambition of results  not for us performance which the multitude can appreciate .
And yet , dear , there is one outward manifestation which my genius is itself calling me to use .
Yes , at last it has found its true vent - not in aught material , not in visible masterpieces such as your robuster imagination can fetter itself to produce and not faint of the clog-such as in my earlier misconception of Art 's mission for me I wrested my gift to produce , - my genius 's vent , its vocation , its mission to the world , is Conversation . ''
`` Oh !
You wo n't have to come and say it to the Speaker ? ''
said Daffodil , before she had had time to think .
`` No , that can not be , '' replied Queen Croässaquagha commiseratingly .
`` My conversation is unofficial .
I give Royal Familiar Conversation Evenings - two or three selected minds that can appreciate are invited , I pour out my soul in conversation , King Brekekex recites his poems , our guests sit entranced or burst into loud rapture and remarks at will - we have no page : 364 ceremonial etiquette on these evenings to limit their freedom of intercourse with us  they are not even forbidden to take notes as I speak .
Poor dear , I wish you were n't kept out of it .
But stop - it 's horribly dangerous , but I think we could make out a form of courtesy for inviting the Speaker for once .
You could be put in a dark corner and sit quite still .
We 'll try it - Yes , to-morrow . ''
But , to her amazement , Daffodil burst out with `` Oh no !
No !
no more sitting death-still pretending to be the Speaker and being afraid every minute of being found out .
I 've too much of it already - too much !
And oh the speeches , speeches , speeches !
- I ca n't listen to anybody more than those dreadful Members of Parliament I have to endure hour after hour already , '' and , the girl 's self-command having thus given way , she burst into a passion of tears and expatiated piteously on the hatefulness of the life she was leading .
Croässaquagha was distressed .
`` We thought it all so nice and comfortable for you , '' she said .
`` And the position of Speaker is a most exalted one . ''
`` I ought n't to grumble , when there has been so much kindness , '' was all Daffodil could rejoin .
She had revealed her misery , and could not gainsay it .
King Brekekex came presently , and Daffodil choked down her tears and endeavoured to interest herself in the King 's poem on her tragical end , which he had brought to read to her .
She found that she was described as having been condemned for bringing to Croäxaxica the weapon which had injured Brekekex 's foot .
Brekekex answered her remonstrance against what she considered a misstatement of the page : 365 fact , that it had been decided by Queen Raucacoäxine that she was pardoned for her other High Treason , so it should be considered never to have taken place , and that the High Treason for which she had perished was to be that one which could not set a bad example to any one , because no one could ever follow it - namely , her importing the thing she called a pin which had nearly killed him .
And it is thus that the crime of the strange being who became Dressmaker Plenipotentiary and the betrothed of the famous Brekekex , and perished the minute before his marriage to her successor , is to this day related in Croäxaxica .
In the midst of the argument , Daffodil 's assumed composure gave way - for no particular reason at the moment  but when one has cried too much one is some time before one is safe against crying more .
Croässaquagha was forced to tell her husband the real source of this outburst of grief , although Daffodil had wished that nobody should be disappointed by hearing of her repinings in the position which had been provided for her safety .
While Croässaquagha was relating , Daffodil sobbing , and Brekekex spreading out his hands and raising his eyes in dismay , the Regius Professor of Everything entered  so matters had to be explained to him too .
Daffodil felt sadly ashamed of her discontent , and she saw that her friends could not help looking on her as somewhat unreasonable  but they pitied her nevertheless , and they knew that the danger of her being discovered was increasing , and was , indeed , becoming a source of anxiety for every one concerned in the conspiracy which had kept her alive after she had formally perished .
They racked their brains for expedients page : 366 for her safe keeping , and she , refreshed by even the suggestion of something possibly to be done , regained her self-possession and tried with them .
But , alas !
there could be no change of the place and mode of her concealment that would not certainly bring betrayal of their secret with all its terrifying consequences .
`` If there were but another country besides Grachidichika and Croäxaxica , '' sighed Brekekex despondingly .
`` There is my own country , '' said Daffodil , making them all smile at her patriotic simplicity in the comparison .
However , it was admitted that what she called her country was somewhere that would have done for her , if she could by any means have been got back to it .
And , as the idea seemed to afford some consolation to her , it was decided that the Regius Professor of Everything should undertake an exhaustive research into all the history and science that was ever written , and the topography of Grachidichika and Croäxaxica in the past and in the present , and the nature of things in general , in order to find out if there could ever be any chance of anyhow by which her getting somewhere outside those countries could be made in the least likely .
The Regius Professor of Everything , who grew deeply animated over the prospect of these long and interesting researches , considered that it would not take him very many years to arrive at a conclusion whether there had ever been anything of the kind , and that that conclusion would make a starting-point .
At this announcement Their Matrimonial Majesties clapped their hands and praised the Professor  but page : 367 Daffodil could only try to smile , in her hopelessness .
The Regius Professor of Everything had come , by King Brekekex 's desire , with Daffodil 's famous pin .
It had been entrusted to him for investigation , previous to its being consigned to the Royal Museum of Marvels , and Brekekex wished to examine it and have Daffodil 's explanation of it , that he might the better achieve the stirring description of it he meant to have in his new poem .
There was much surprise when Daffodil showed that the tuft of moss round the head and the rust and green spores on the stem were no part of the construction of the implement , and , after a little labour of scraping and rubbing , produced the pin to them cleared and almost bright - in the state in which it is now preserved in the Royal Museum of Marvels , enclosed in a costly and exquisitely made sheath of plaited fish-bones .
She had her surprise too , for , chancing to take up the tuft out of which she had extracted the pin 's head , she found it was studded with little growing things looking like tiny beads of several colours , but soft like mushrooms to the touch .
`` They are of no consequence , '' said the Professor of Everything , as she admired them .
`` We find various coloured sprouts on some of our plants , and , if they would last , they might be useful in jewellery , but they never come to the size of even the smallest toadstool , and they burst or shrink into nothing as soon as they have come to their full size .
So we never notice them . ''
But Daffodil thought she would keep them and notice them  and , insignificant as they were , she found that the little things made her an interest page : 368 amid the monotony of what soon had to be , for safety 's sake , her almost unbroken imprisonment in the House of Parliament .
Directly the Parliamentary sitting was over and the last Member gone , she would take her tuft of moss from the little pool she kept it in and look for the change in each little bead .
They had a way of varying their colours which greatly attracted her  and sometimes one would have grown less than its neighbours , or would seem shrivelled , and then she fed its roots with drops of the nourishing yellow mud in which the decorative flowers of the Speaker 's canopy were embedded , and watched the nursling revive and spread .
She had to be very tender in her handling , for sometimes , on a touch , two or three of them would break and run together in one , or would even wholly disappear : but this necessity for care , though sometimes vexatious , made her peculiar gardening all the more absorbing and her funny little treasures the more precious .
So the fungi that were thought of so little consequence helped her to patience , and gave her the something to enliven her pent up life without which her mind might have grown too gloomy and weak for her to be able to resist the temptation which at times came upon her to rush out and reveal herself and end the long restraint .
Of course she never would have seriously planned such an act - if no thought for her own life hindered such a plan , there was the betrayal of her preservers to consider .
But weeks went on , and Daffodil 's one interest threatened to fail her .
The little beads had become big enough to touch each other , and then , though page : 369 she tried hard to keep them apart , they had grown into each other until there were only five .
The five went on for a while still increasing in bulk , till they became like small toadstools , at first of all the bright colours the beads had shown , but soon only a silvery grey .
And , before many days after that change , the silver was fading out of the grey , and the fungi began to shrivel .
Evidently they were going to shrink into nothing , as the Regius Professor had said .
All Daffodil 's efforts to renew their freshness failed , and she watched their decay in sadness , as if they had been live things about to die .
At last a hope came into her heart .
She waited till the quietest time of night , and ventured through the canals - swimming very slowly , not to be heard , and keeping only her nose and mouth above water - till she got into the guggle-gig grounds .
There she dipped the perforated bladder-berry which was her own drinking cup into the precious violet guggle-ooze till it was quite full .
And now she had to go back by , instead of swimming in the canals , running on the paths , that the ooze might not be lost in the canal water  but she was fortunate enough to meet no one .
No sooner was she safe back in the House of Parliament than she tried her experiment for restoring her beloved nurslings to health by the vigour-giving guggle-ooze water .
She intended to try it only very gradually on one of the fungi to begin with , lest the ooze should not prove so suitable as she expected  but , in her eagerness , she did not wait long enough to recover from the exertion of the extreme speed at which she had had to run  her hand shook , and she spirted the ooze freely over all the five .
There was page : 370 an instant sound of cracking and splitting - every one of the fungi had vanished  something like a little slime and dust lay for a moment where each had stood , then sank into the moss and left no trace .
Daffodil positively screamed with grief and remorse .
It felt as if they were friends she had killed .
Next morning early she was awakened from troubled slumbers by the sound of approaching voices and steps .
She had barely time to arrange herself in the Speaker 's seat in stately stiffness , when a little crowd blocked the window and the door and a policeman entered and began to hunt about in every nook and corner , as if for some lost object .
As soon as he went out , another came in and hunted about in the same way , and then another , and another .
She heard the people outside telling each other that some one passing near the House of Parliament in the night had heard a fearful cry from within and had had to run away as fast as he could , lest anything should be going to happen  he had hastened this morning to give the information , and this inspection was the result .
Fortunately for Daffodil , everything that could have betrayed her was hidden away in the hollows of the Speaker 's seat and footstool , except the bladder-berry cup full of ooze .
That was found lying where she had let it drop in her sorrowful disappointment , and was considered to show that some villain , probably from Croäxaxica , had been marauding in the guggle-gig grounds and had carried his insolence so far as to try to use the House of Parliament as a temporary shelter .
He had doubtless been alarmed by the august presence of the Speaker , and hence the cry page : 371 that had been heard .
The drinking bladder was carried away in proof of this story , and Daffodil was still unsuspected .
But the idea of strangers coming with nefarious purposes to the precious scarlet guggle-gig grounds and harbouring in the House of Parliament , once set afoot , aroused a watchfulness which made it still more difficult than it had already become for her friends to approach her and for her to stir forth .
In spite of her serious anxiety during the inspection , Daffodil could not but feel a pang when she saw the tuft of moss upon which her nurslings had grown tossed into a corner as a thing of nought .
It seemed to her a relic of the dear little companions of her seclusion , and , as soon as she was safely alone , she sought it where she had seen it fall .
What was her surprise , as she gently smoothed it out , to find growing in the centre of it a tiny cup of five silvery grey petals !
The broken fungi had not died  they had run together under the moss to reappear in this form .
Daffodil could hardly refrain from a cry of delight which would have entailed another inspection of her abode .
She had not killed her friends  and she had again something to pet and watch .
Next time the Head Royal and Matrimonial Valet got to her with provisions , she begged him for the future to let her always have with the supply what she had hitherto declined , a vase of guggle-ooze .
When she had obtained one , she began to feed her flower with the choice fluid - very , very , carefully , trying but one drop like a grain of sand the first time , and only watering amply when she had gradually become quite sure that it did good .
page : 372 Under this treatment , the strange little plant throve and developed : ere long the petals doubled and formed an inner cup , the inner cup grew taller and the outer cup wider , and at last there was , in all but colour , the exact copy of what Daffodil had picked on the felled tree .
Daffodil found a new joy in this resemblance , but she did not let it delude her into belief in the usefulness of her flower : something in its look and touch made her feel sure that the mysterious life of the elf-cup was not in it .
She set the moss in a bowl of guggle-ooze , and thus amply nourished , the plant gained new vigour , the silvery grey hue took a faint blue tinge in the saucer petals and a faint pink in the cup petals  but after that there was no more change , she had to be content with admiring it as it was and watching anxiously against injuries or symptoms of disease .
And , well as she still loved it , it was not so interesting now it was always alike .
There came a Parliamentary recess .
Daffodil could breathe freely all day .
But now she was moping and languid , and she came to think that even the Members of Parliament with their speeches were better than the long monotony of every day .
She sat half asleep hour by hour , just rousing herself to take the necessary food or to see that her plant had guggle-ooze enough , and she noticed nothing much .
She did not see the beginning of a threatening sign in the soft grey petals  they were hardening ready to shrivel .
But in a little while the mischief was more visible : it caught her eye one day as she replenished the bowl , and bitter were her self-reproaches for not having been more page : 373 alert to detect the first traces of waning freshness .
All her energy was now given to invigorate the plant and check the advance of decay  but whatever she could do seemed labour lost .
The hardness passed off , the petals hung limp and full of wrinkles , the whole flower was well-nigh dead .
`` Something must be done for you , my darling , '' cried Daffodil in desperation , and , remembering the virtue of the guggle-ooze and whence it was derived , she thought of something .
She wrote an impassioned letter to Queen Croässaquagha , beseeching her to send her some of the lighting-water of the Ancient Royal Wardrobe .
This was an inconvenient request , for anything that could in the least awaken suspicion of other uses than that of light-giving for this water might lead to the discovery of the secret of the scarlet guggle-gigs and the ruin of the new born prosperity of Grachidichika : but Daffodil 's anxiety to preserve her plant 's life seemed so intense that Brekekex and Croässaquagha agreed that she could not be denied what she had persuaded herself would be a restorative for it , and , after much mental effort , they devised a scheme for sending her the lighting-water unperceived by the Head Royal Valet who took it to her .
They filled some mussel-shells with the water and carefully closed their valves together with mud , then , laying them at the bottom of a basket , they placed above them some remarkably fine mussels , and sent them to her as a special present from the King and Queen .
The Head Royal Valet naturally enjoyed himself upon a few , but the mussel-shells at the bottom were smaller than those at the top , so he was not tempted to page : 374 prefer them , and they reached their destination untouched .
Daffodil did not look on the present very gratefully  Their Matrimonial Majesties had not ventured to reveal their stratagem by letter , and she thought these mussels had been sent her as a sort of consolation for the withholding the lighting-water , for which she rummaged in vain among them as well as among the other stores the Head Royal Valet left with her as usual .
But , reflecting that so great a loss might come of any imprudence about the lighting-water that the King and Queen of Grachidichika might well find a difficulty in sending it , she became ashamed of her cross feelings and began to eat the mussels , as a sort of apology .
Soon she chanced upon one that was very tight closed , and muddy at the edges , and , when she had got it opened , there was the glitter of the shining water !
She hastened to try her flower with a drop like a splash of dew , and to her delight the flower drank it and seemed at once to expand a little .
She would not risk doing too much at once , but , with punctual care , she went on from time to time letting another drop trickle into each cup , and at last she could be sure that the petals were regaining their smooth fleshy texture and their opaline tints of silvery grey with the pale pink and the pale blue shining through .
She continued to bestow daily some of the contents of her treasured shells of water on the plant after its recovery , lest there should be any relapse , and soon she found its colours deepening and flushing .
And a strange hope began in her heart , and now she tended the flower with a trembling anxiety for what it might become for her .
page : 375 The colours still deepened and flushed , and at last the upper petals were the brightest and clearest scarlet possible , and the lower petals the richest crimson .
The elf-cup was there in full life .
But what then ?
She tried to make it unclose the green vault over her from below , as the elf-cup which had brought her to Croäxaxica had from above , but in vain .
There was not the slightest sign of its possessing any power .
The ceiling of the House of Parliament remained unshaken when she had , after effort on effort , clambered and swung herself aloft among the drooping water-grasses to touch it with her talisman .
It was the same with the Ancient Royal Wardrobe , where , by much urgency , she got her friends to let her venture once more to make her trial .
It was the same when Brekekex and Croässaquagha , to whom she had tremblingly confided the priceless flower , tested its effect for her in one place after another .
They had at last to send it back to her by the Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - maid , once Seventy Seven And A Half , with the discouraging message that it had no value but that which her defunct Plenipotentiaryship 's Pre-eminence took in watching its growth had given it .
page : 376 CHAPTER XXV .
ONE evening late , Daffodil was sitting , weary and sorrowful , in her Speaker 's chair .
Every now and then the gloom around the lonely House of Parliament was changed into coloured glows reflected from waterworks , and the acclamations of all Grachidichika rang into the silence where she sat  for a great and happy event had taken place , and this was the winding-up festivity of a series such as the Matrimonial Estate and Independent Kingdom had not known for centuries .
King Brekekex had had twin sons born to him .
And there was added to this immense cause of rejoicing a brilliant incident of much importance to the honour of the Grachidichikan Monarchy and the country : the King and Queen were , on the morrow , to make a Royal journey to Croäxaxica and be there welcomed , with no incognito and make-believe devices , but as Sovereigns on a visit , in their own persons , to the King and Queen of the inimitable Croäxaxicans .
The straitened circumstances of the Matrimonial dynasty had made such a display of their sovereign rights out of the question , even if Croäxaxican Royalty had been formerly disposed to encourage page : 377 ambition in the allied but lowlier family : but , now that the Matrimonial King was the possessor of a revenue which , besides paying the expenses , might have raised the position of any Matrimonial King so much as to call for such public honour from the Court of Croäxaxica , and that he was a son of very Croäxaxican Royalty itself , this Royal Visit of Sovereign to Sovereign , for the presentation of the Heir Apparent of the throne of Grachidichika by his lofty parents the King and Queen of Grachidichika to his still loftier Grand Parents the King and Queen of Croäxaxica , was desirable for everybody 's glory , and in fact a matter of international necessity .
No wonder that Grachidichika was jubilant that evening .
But Daffodil had become so disappointed that she could not rouse herself to enjoy her share in the public entertainment .
Indeed , small as it was , it seemed too much for her  she would rather not have seen the reflections of the lights and heard the shouts , for they reminded her of her own never ending isolation .
Suddenly some one in a hurry , as if pursuers for his life were at his heels , appeared in the portal and bounded to her side .
It was the Regius Professor of Everything .
`` I do n't think anybody can have seen me , '' he said nervously .
`` They 're all so intent on the waterworks . ''
`` I hope no one has , '' she said .
`` Why did you run the risk ?
Too much risk has to be run for me at any rate . ''
`` I do n't believe there can be a creature but our two selves on this side of Grachidichika , '' he said , encouraging himself , `` Even our own inimitable page : 378 Croäxaxicans are almost all gathered into the places where they can see some of the waterworks shooting up above the great wall of Grachidichika . ''
`` It is a comfort to feel that for once somebody can venture to me in safety , '' she said .
`` Quite in safety .
Oh , certainly quite in safety , '' reiterated the Professor , evidently pleased at the comfortable sound of the words .
`` But , your defunct Pre-eminence , do sit stiffer .
And do n't forget that , if anybody did come by some awkward chance , I can only be considered as making an official communication to the Speaker - But dear me what about ?
The Regius Professor of Everything of Croäxaxica ca n't be considered to be making an Official Communication to the Speaker of the Parliament of Grachidichika about anything .
Oh do sit stiffer . ''
Daffodil assumed extra rigidity in order to set her visitor at his ease , and he found himself able to proceed with the story he had come to tell .
`` Of course your defunct Pre-eminence has been building great hopes on the researches confided to me by Their Matrimonial Majesties and your former Plenipotentiaryship , '' he began .
`` Not very great , '' faltered Daffodil , sorry to disappoint him .
But fortunately he did not hear her .
Struck by a sudden thought of the danger there would be if she were heard , he had rushed on with `` By the way , my dear defunct Pre-eminent Madam , pray do not speak .
If anybody did chance to come near , you know , and had very sharp ears they might catch the sound , and your voice is not so like mine as we could both wish . ''
page : 379 Having thus brought her to complete stillness and silence , he told her - at considerable length , for his story interested him and hushed his fears - of the studies into which he had plunged in his researches on her behalf and the other irrelevant , but profound , studies into which those had incidentally led him .
`` I am now , '' he wound up , `` in a position to conclude with still more authority than at first that I shall eventually completely verify the truth of my hypothesis that there is no trace of such an event as what your defunct Pre-eminence desires ever having occurred .
And that is cheering in the extreme  for , when I have made certain that no such exit has ever occurred since the Great Separation which secured Croäxaxica and this neighbouring state of Grachidichika their enjoyment of their undisturbed exaltation above the inferior races , and that no means for such an exit has , as yet existed , I shall be able to turn my mind to the more merely practical question of whether any means for it could exist in the future , and thus exhaust the whole subject . ''
Daffodil thought he had told her all he had come to tell , and wondered whether she might speak to thank him for the trouble he had taken .
But as soon as she gave a little preparatory `` Hem , '' to try , he stopped her with `` I entreat your former Plenipotentiaryship to listen .
I have an incidental circumstance to relate - a matter which may possibly require your attention , for somebody appears to have sent you a communication . ''
`` Somebody ? ''
she said , surprised .
`` Oh do n't speak , do n't .
Somebody or something .
It was thus : In the course of my investiga - page : 380 tions I naturally became deeply interested in the perusal of my various treatises on the ancient communication of Croäxaxica with the bog , or pool .
called the sea - the proof of which , as you are aware , still remains in the shape of an ancient tunnel extending beyond inhabited Croäxaxica and of the trickling into that tunnel , at its extremity , of the peculiar water which is so acceptable to our oysters and to various plants and animals for food said to have been originally imported from the sea .
My accounts of this tunnel excited my curiosity concerning it , and the fancy came to me that I should like to see a place about which I had thought so profoundly and written so much .
It was an odd freak for a frog of my years and ripened learning , and I took my journey alone , that it might not become a theme of comment throughout the world , and chose for it this period of preparation for the approaching Royal Visit , when it might be supposed that public attention would be less fixed upon me than usual .
Yesterday , then , I traversed that once famous passage , now used only by the cultivators of the seaweed beds which border its narrow path , and , resolved to complete my scientific exploration in spite of all weariness , I arrived at its very termination .
There , after I had been some time at rest , I discerned , where the sea water trickles down .
a visible though trifling fissure , and , bent on research .
I climbed up to it and gazed through it .
I saw what appeared to be a vast pool and a roof of some blue filmy material , apparently a peculiar sort of water , but nothing of any interest .
While I was busy at the fissure , I heard , from somewhere without , a voice page : 381 repeating a cry which my grammatical studies led me to recognise as possessing a similarity to your defunct Pre-eminence 's name of Daffodil , as pronounced by yourself .
I called to the creature ( as I suppose it to have been ) making this cry , and it responded with a variety of meaningless sounds which reminded me somewhat of those you have used when you have reproduced for me the accent of your tribe .
I amused myself for a while with provoking these inarticulate replies and myself producing imitations of the cry which had at first attracted my attention , but , tiring of this amusement , I was about to descend from beside the fissure , when this shell , of an unknown species , was pushed through it , with what seemed to be , in the same strange pronunciation , the words ' A message for Daffodil . ' ''
`` A message ! ''
exclaimed Daffodil , taking the shell , `` Oh !
will it speak to me ? ''
She held it to her ear to catch its murmur , and she found it was saying over and over again `` If Daffodil can find the elf-cup that is child of her elf-cup , she can come back through where she entered .
But it must be the right day : to-morrow , or the morrow seven years  to-morrow , or the morrow seven years .
Seven years , or its seven years , or else to-morrow . ''
The river people had learned from Keziah 's lamentations what had become of Daffodil .
They had no means of access to Croäxaxica , but they knew of the fissure - which was near the mouth of their own river - and they had long been watching there and calling for Daffodil and trying to send her their message .
They had sung it into many a shell  but the shells had fallen unheeded and got page : 382 broken .
And the seaweed tillers in the tunnel , though the call had sometimes reached their ears , had never thought of a meaning for it .
The Regius Professor of Everything was heartily pleased when Daffodil told him what news he had brought her .
`` Behold the value of Science , '' he remarked .
`` No one but myself could have accomplished your release .
I congratulate you from my heart on your escape from the dangers which surround you , - and , by the way , '' he added , `` your friends too .
Oh , do sit stiff again . ''
For now he had done his story , his attention was re-awakened to the danger of their being found out .
`` From the Throne Hall of Croäxaxica ! ''
she said .
`` And no later than to-morrow ! ''
`` You are right : it is indeed impossible for tomorrow , '' replied the Professor .
`` But do n't be discouraged , your defunct Pre-eminence  who knows what may happen before to-morrow seven years ? ''
And thereupon he took his leave hastily , eager to be anywhere where his presence could be better accounted for .
But Daffodil , left alone , decided that what was most impossible of all was to wait seven years .
She managed , though the operation was difficult without assistance , to undo a seam of the Speaker and wriggle herself out .
Then , after arraying herself in the last dress which the Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - maid had supplied her - dimmed and discoloured now by long keeping - she took the Speaker 's stuffing from her storeplace in the hollow of his seat , disposed it properly within him , and carefully reset the little needle-stitches she had un - page : 383 picked .
Whatever might be the result of the venture she contemplated , she felt sure she could never return to the Speaker  and she arranged him in complete order as he had been before he was put to her use .
She also removed every trace of her occupation of the House of Parliament , burying and sinking all the articles that had been brought her for her needs .
She had put the elf-cup inside the shell , under the lip of which it instantly fixed its root , as the sea anemone fixes itself to a rock  she now placed the shell inside her pouch-bag and with it a still unopened mussel-shell of the lighting-water for the nourishment of the elf-cup - the last mussel-full she possessed , for Brekekex and Croässaquagha had not yet been able to renew her supply , in answer to her supplications .
Her preparations being thus completed , she hastened forth  for her purpose must be effected before the waterworks were over .
The bursts of variegated light that flashed on her as she hurried on showed her that the culminating splendours of the display were beginning  but still there was plenty of time for her journey , if she could accomplish it at all .
All Grachidichika was , as the Professor had told her , absorbed by the waterworks , she met no one and saw no one .
Soon she was in the canal which skirts Grachidichika inside its wall .
She had expected to have to watch her moment for endeavouring to pass the Grachidichikan guard stationed at the inner portal of the tunnel through the wall while their gaze was fixed on the waterworks in the opposite direction , and her fear of failure here was great  but , on reaching the spot , she found there was no guard .
It had been assumed page : 384 that no Grachidichikan could possibly want to slip out of the country for that night  and the Croäxaxicans were , of course , responsible for Croäxaxicans being kept in Croäxaxica .
Egress through the tunnel was , however , not to be thought of by Daffodil : the Croäxaxican guard on the outer side was more likely to have been strengthened than withdrawn , and the faces of the soldiers would be turned towards Grachidichika and the glitter of the waterworks where they shot higher than the wall - her advancing figure would be sure to catch some one 's eye .
She passed on along the canal to where a flight of steps ascended to the niche and window perforated for the sole use of the present King of Grachidichika , according to the agreement made with the King and Queen of Croäxaxica before his ascent to the throne .
Here watch had been hitherto kept by night as well as by day to prevent any illegal attempts at peeping out , and again it was only on the attraction of the waterworks that Daffodil had built her hope of passing : but now she felt it no surprise to find the post deserted .
To be sure no one would be wanting to peep out into the night dusks of Croäxaxica at present .
She hopped up the tall stairs - no light stretch for her un-frog-like limbs - and reached the window .
Its height from the canal alarmed her  but she could , by now , dive and swim , if not like one of the natives , as no human being had ever dreamt of being able to do  and escape hence was her only way .
She waited a moment or two in silent preparation , and plunged into the depth .
The Croäxaxican guard , just then looking into the air where the spray of orange and page : 385 purple jets was tossing , heard the splash and , as soon as their heads could be got the right way again , a detachment swam to the place whence it had sounded : but the ripples had disappeared and Daffodil had already passed under the water into the back ways through the Palace grounds .
So the Croäxaxican guard , seeing nothing , became quite sure they had heard nothing , and hastened back to their contemplation of the tops of the distant waterworks .
Daffodil had no more difficulty in reaching her destination .
The ways she took were deserted , for the Professor was right that the Croäxaxicans were gathered in the places where they could catch glimpses of the display in Grachidichika - which was still more fascinating from its novelty than from what they could see of it .
And she only wanted to get into the Queen 's Royal Private Garden , close at hand .
There she meant to wait for a chance next day of some one entering who might be got to convey to the Queen secret intelligence of her presence there and her entreaty for an interview  and , if that might not be , she would issue forth and surrender herself openly .
It was now made quite certain that her reappearance could not reveal the secrets of her means of escape from the Boa Constrictor and her refuge since , and she could act with what boldness she needs must , and risk no one but herself .
Fortune favoured her next morning .
Queen Raucacoäxine awoke early , full of excitement and pleasure at the approaching glories of the day  she could not stay in bed , and , when she was up , she page : 386 could not keep quiet .
Among her many sources of satisfaction was one connected with the former object of her apprehensions , the Duke of Happypool .
There had been a reconciliation .
His Grace could never again have pretensions to the throne of Grachidichika  his every chance had disappeared in the moment when Croässaquagha , while the Queen of Croäxaxica was nominating her Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , stepped over the threshold of the Cathedral as Brekekex 's wife , and King Grenoulcrawk still breathed on .
And not only his every chance but his children 's , for , even were it supposable that Brekekex would have no son , the younger sons of his brother , the Crown Prince , would be in the line of succession .
And , not only was all annoyance at the Duke , on account of his nearness to the Crown of Grachidichika , removed , but Queen Raucacoäxine had recently learned that , so far from his ever having cherished disloyal feelings , all his unpleasant ways had come from its having been a hope of his youth to marry her and his not getting over the disappointment easily , and that he had , moreover , been embittered by never having been asked to one of her Private Sociable Evenings , when it was the most anxious desire he had to feast his eyes on her dancing at them .
On learning all this , the Queen had magnanimously restored the Duke and his family to Court credit , and , more than that , had appointed a Private Sociable Evening to be held at the earliest possible date and had invited him to it .
It was necessary to consider that the journey from Grachidichika would have been so fatiguing for Their Matrimonial Majesties , from its page : 387 length , that , after the ceremonial of the Royal State Reception , they would not be equal to other public enjoyments till the morrow : nothing therefore could be more appropriate than to have the Private Sociable Evening for the winding-up of the first day .
And now it struck Queen Raucacoäxine in her restlessness , that a good way to while away the time that was hanging on her hands would be to retire to her Royal Private Garden and secretly practise her steps to , if possible , an extra amazing pitch of perfection .
She was working at the great Royal Raucacoäxine Slipping Step - the step she had founded on Daffodil 's glides - when Daffodil approached , and she was so engrossed in what she was doing that she forgot to feel any surprise on seeing her , but merely remarked `` Oh is it you ?
Just dance this step a moment or two .
I forget how I do this middle slide , and I 'll just look at your attempts . ''
The two had practised their dancing together a little before the Queen remembered the strangeness of Daffodil 's being there at all .
Then , throwing herself into a seat , she exclaimed , `` But , Heigho My !
Who can you be ?
Of course you 're not you , because the Boa Constrictor swallowed her , poor dear thing . ''
`` It could n't swallow me , Your Majesty , '' said Daffodil .
`` Then where have you been ever since you perished ? ''
inquired the Queen .
`` I have been hiding , '' she replied .
`` I shall require fuller explanation , '' remarked the Queen .
`` But never mind now - I 've such a lot page : 388 on my mind .
But , dear me !
Now I come to think of it , this is very awkward .
You 've perished , so you 're nobody , and who am I talking to ?
I ca n't talk to nobody , you know .
And then , if I made you somebody , what a very dangerous precedent !
People would suppose that , after they had perished for High Treason , instead of being swallowed by the Boa Constrictor in the proper way , they could just slink back again and be somebody else . ''
`` There are two ways to get over the difficulty of my setting that example , please Your Majesty , '' said Daffodil .
`` One , of course , is to put me to death - '' `` But that seems so difficult to do , '' interrupted the perplexed Queen .
`` And , then , executing a person twice would seem so odd .
And , besides , now you 're nobody , how can you have done anything to be put to death for ?
And really I am very glad you are alive  I have always been sorry you were n't  and I do n't want in the least to put you to death now you have perished enough without it . ''
`` I am trusting in Your Majesty 's not wanting to be so cruel , '' said Daffodil .
`` I will tell you the other way .
You can let me pass out of Croäxaxica altogether - secretly - by the way I came  and so it need never be publicly known that you were not able to get me put to death when you tried .
I have a flower that can open me a passage , if I am helped up to touch the roof of the Great Throne Hall with it .
Only , Your Majesty , it must be done before to-morrow begins , or it could n't be for page : 389 seven years , and that would not be the same thing at all . ''
But the Queen remained in too much confusion of mind about Daffodil 's bewildering position to decide on any course of action .
Daffodil repeated her suggestion thrice over without matters seeming to have become much clearer to her .
And it had become necessary for her to return to her apartments to be dressed in her best Royal Robes to receive the King and Queen of Grachidichika .
`` I will come back again some time and give you instructions , '' she said , with an air of relief at having , so far , come to a decision : but then her puzzled look returned .
`` Though what instructions can be given to anybody that 's nobody is past all comprehension , '' she was murmuring as she went from the garden .
Daffodil could not but fear that Her Majesty would come to no conclusion before tomorrow began , even if her memory of the interview were distinct enough to retain her attention amid the excitements of the day , concerning which she had anxious doubts .
But , after the Royal State Reception was over , it was to be considered that the Royal Guests had need of an interval of complete repose to refresh themselves from the fatigue of their journey , all the Royal Family of Croäxaxica took advantage of this interval too , and Queen Raucacoäxine , as she lay on her couch after a comfortable doze , found herself reflecting about Daffodil .
The puzzle in her head now was , not as to Daffodil 's existence in the state of being nobody , for she had become accustomed to that , at first perplexing , idea , but as to what had page : 390 become of her from the time of her execution until now .
Her Majesty felt that , if this defunct Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was a sort of person who could be somewhere without any one knowing it , she might as well go back there instead of causing damage to the ceiling of the Great Throne Hall by removing herself from observation through it .
And her curiosity was aroused .
She went again alone to the Royal Private Garden .
But Daffodil would answer none of her inquiries .
`` Your Majesty , '' she said , `` if , as you say , your mind is made up that I must not pass out from your Kingdom without my telling you my history since my execution , you will have to keep me in your Kingdom , alive or dead .
But I may tell you that I hid where another person could hide . ''
`` Oh !
what an example ! ''
groaned the Queen .
`` I should like to be an example for people getting away from your Boa Constrictor , '' said Daffodil .
`` But just consider , '' Queen Raucacoäxine urged , in despair at Daffodil 's stubbornness .
`` How can any Queen-Manager of her Royal husband 's Kingdom allow somebody she has had executed to be somewhere for months and then let her slip through the very Throne Hall ceiling without knowing where she has been all the while and how it was managed ?
It would be most derogatory to me , even if I did n't want to know . ''
`` But I am not somebody , Your Majesty , '' Daffodil replied .
`` Your Majesty says I became nobody the moment I was executed .
And it ca n't matter where it was where nobody was , nor how the page : 391 being there was managed for nobody  and I am sure it can not be derogatory to Your Majesty not to learn about it from nobody . ''
`` There is much in that argument , '' said the Queen thoughtfully .
`` I think , after all , I had better hold a Secret Family Council about this matter . ''
page : 392 CHAPTER XXVI .
QUEEN RAUCACOƒXINE lost no time before calling the Royal Family together .
Brekekex and Croässaquagha , although , strictly speaking , not entitled to advise in Croäxaxica , were admitted to the Council in consequence of their former familiarity with the State policies concerning Daffodil , and of their Intellects , and the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician were , for similar reasons , required to attend .
Her Majesty 's statement that the Defunct Dressmaker Plenipotentiary was in Her Royal Private Garden filled all her hearers with amazement - not less those who had known of Daffodil 's survival than those who had not .
King Logaplop was the first to speak .
`` I am glad to hear it , '' he said .
After that nobody hesitated .
All expressed satisfaction that Daffodil , although non-existing , had escaped with life : and , indeed , all , including Queen Raucacoäxine , felt pleased at this agreeable result of the execution of their former favourite .
But the inconvenience , both to herself and the Kingdom of Croäxaxica , that she , who had perished as a High Traitor , should be going about alive like any loyal page : 393 subject who had never been executed , and the difficulty of devising any position for one who had parted with her existence , were obvious to them all .
`` I saw all that at once , only too clearly , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` But there is a remedy - if it were not for her obstinacy . ''
She related the scheme for Daffodil 's exit  and she related also Daffodil 's refusal to give any of the information demanded of her .
`` She will never give up her own way - not though she really wanted quite a different way , '' said Brekekex .
`` And if she says she wo n't give the information she wo n't give it even if you get the Boa Constrictor to swallow her first . ''
`` And I should like to let her go away alive , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` Oh , do , '' cried King Brekekex , Queen Croässaquagha , the Crown Prince , the Crown Princess , Princess Zumbarzabulixine , Princess Guachapeara , the Regius Professor of Everything , and the Head Royal Physician .
`` Why not ? ''
said King Logaplop .
And that ended the discussion , for nobody had anything to reply .
`` As we have nothing to do till dressing for dinner , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine , `` we might spend the afternoon in My Royal Private Garden . ''
So they all went to see Daffodil , and made much of her .
The King of Croäxaxica said `` How do you do '' to her before he settled himself to sleep in a garden chair , the Crown Prince entered into conversation with her , the Royal Princesses brought her food with their own hands , stealing it for her from page : 394 the tables where the Royal dinner was being laid .
It was a great drawback , however , to Daffodil 's enjoyment of her restoration to favour that the Croäxaxican Prince and Princesses , and still more Queen Raucacoäxine herself , found it difficult to talk to her two minutes together without recurring to the subject of her escape and concealment .
She felt relieved when King Brekekex proposed to read aloud a few cantos of his poem on her fate : but King Brekekex nearly betrayed himself and his fellow conspirators , for , instead of stopping at the Execution , he let his poetic enthusiasm be just hurrying him on to the lines about the mighty victor triumphing over the Boa Constrictor , when the involuntary groans of the Head Royal Physician and the Professor of Everything recalled him to prudence .
After that he betook himself with Croässaquagha to a seat apart  while Guachapeara , who had now acquired an ample genius , expounded to Daffodil her views on the Plenipotentiary art , amid the rapture of the surrounding group .
By and by Brekekex and Croässaquagha returned .
They walked right up to Queen Raucacoäxine , with an air of something to be done .
`` Majestic Mother , '' said Brekekex , `` we had rather tell the truth and have done with it . ''
And , thereupon , he related the part he and Croässaquagha had had in Daffodil 's escape from the Boa Constrictor , and the shelter they had given her in their Kingdom .
`` Pray do n't be angry with us , '' said he and Croässaquagha , when the tale was told .
`` Not angry ! ''
exclaimed the Queen of Croäxaxica .
`` Not angry , when my own son and the un - page : 395 Royal subject I permitted to marry him presumed to interfere in such an extraordinary manner with the carrying out of my orders ! ''
`` Ah !
Your Majesty , '' pleaded Croässaquagha , `` Just think  what could we do ?
Brekekex and I felt we could n't possibly get on with the marriage , if Daffodil had been killed for it . ''
`` We could n't possibly , '' said Brekekex .
`` In fact I am sure we should both have been in such a state from crying that we could not have appeared in public at all , without a scandal . ''
`` What you say puts matters in a different light , '' Queen Raucacoäxine replied , after some reflection .
`` Undoubtedly , if Daffodil 's being swallowed by the Boa Constrictor would have made it impossible for you to obey my direct command to you to get married in time to have the Crown of Grachidichika properly disposed of , you were acting in a true spirit of obedience when you prevented the impossibility being caused .
But I can not consider that , as King and Queen of a country in the alliance and under the protection of Croäxaxica , you ought to have given shelter to our High Traitor . ''
`` But the High Traitor had perished , '' interposed Daffodil .
`` To be sure , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` I was somehow overlooking that fact .
Having perished and become nobody I do not see that she was anybody it was your duty to surrender to Croäxaxican justice .
Come to my heart .
You have acted as became My son and the person I could permit to marry a son of Mine . ''
`` But , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine , bethinking page : 396 herself , after the embrace was over , `` Somebody must have been disobeying me .
You could not have managed it all without help . ''
`` We did have some help , '' stammered King Brekekex .
`` Servants and subjects can not resist the desires of Princes , '' said the Professor of Everything , with a tremulous voice .
`` They have to do whatever the Royal Person they are with tells them , '' added the Head Royal Physician , scarcely able to speak above a whisper .
`` Oh , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine , scarcely noticing who had spoken and continuing to address King Brekekex .
`` Your own servants , and subjects of Grachidichika : that is another matter .
Of course you must be careful that the Grachidichikans respect our Croäxaxican supremacy , but it would never do if they were allowed to set an example of not obeying Royal Authority .
Besides , you were still a Croäxaxican Prince at the time of the Execution , so there could be no question about the Supremacy in the transactions .
The servants were quite right .
Dear faithful things  I shall certainly make them some present to reward their devotion to you . ''
On this Brekekex and Croässaquagha named their Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet and their Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - maid as the servants who had had duties to perform in connection with Daffodil 's rescue from the customary consequences of an execution for High Treason , and who had waited on her in the House of Parliament .
And Daffodil , learning that they were of the suite who had attended the King and Queen of Grachi - page : 397 dichika to Croäxaxica , begged that they might be summoned now , in order that she might thank them for their services to her and wish them good-bye before her departure .
The two were now frog and wife  they had , by their Royal Master and Mistress 's own desire , celebrated their marriage on the yesterday which had been marked by such signal rejoicings in Grachidichika : and , when they appeared together , and started back in affright on seeing Daffodil and , in her , the assurance that all had been discovered , they were greeted by merry congratulations and by wedding gifts of jewels and money .
Queen Raucacoäxine , herself , took a costly bracelet from her wrist and placed it on the wrist of the quondam Seventy Seven And A Half , and the Crown Prince put his purse with a week 's income in it into the hand of the Head Royal and Matrimonial Valet .
Daffodil could only give kindly words of gratitude and farewell .
`` I have nothing to offer for wedding gift , '' she said .
`` Oh yes , dear Daffodil , you have if you like , '' said the Princess Guachapeara .
`` I have no right to your jewels , and I have plenty of my own .
Do give them away just as you wish . ''
There is no forfeiture to the Crown among the inimitable Croäxaxicans .
They consider that the criminal 's family is to be pitied both for having the disgrace of a disloyal relative and for losing whatever use or pleasure he ( or she ) might have been to them , and that the least that can be done for them is to let them have whatever belonged to him ( or her , ) even if some compensation is not made to them for their troubles .
In Daffodil 's case the difficulty page : 398 had been what to do with her property , which , as to her ornaments , was of some value .
Her jewelled fillet and star of office were naturally passed on to Guachapeara , and the tiara given her by Queen Raucacoäxine for her marriage in Grachidichika to Croässaquagha  but merely personal things - necklaces , bracelets , and unofficial trinkets - which could only be treated as matters of private inheritance , would have found no owner if it had not been decided that Guachapeara 's position as next successor but one in the office held by Daffodil , and as Daffodil 's pupil , should constitute her her heir .
But Guachapeara was now so cheerfully desirous that Daffodil should , herself , dispose of her former property that Daffodil accepted the pleasure of bestowing one or two valuable presents on the newly married couple , and of requesting the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician to receive each one of her beautiful watches .
She arranged that Guachapeara should present to the principal officials who had served under her while she was Dressmaker Plenipotentiary , and to the Lieutenant of the State Prison and the Officer in Command , trinkets of some costliness , in memory of her .
All the members of the Royal family were to select trinkets for which they might care , as keepsakes , and Guachapeara was to reserve for herself the splendid necklace Daffodil had received from Croässaquagha , and to hold as an inheritance all else that remained .
It was , of course , impossible for Daffodil to possess anything , herself , now that she had , by her execution , become non-existent : but she could scarcely have carried any of her page : 399 former possessions in her exit from Croäxaxica , and they would not have retained their beauty and durability in her native atmosphere .
Guachapeara was good-natured enough to go for the things for the wedding couple and the Head Royal Physician and the Regius Professor , in order that Daffodil might present them personally .
`` You can tell it to your descendants to the farthest generation that a Croäxaxican Royal Princess , Dressmaker Plenipotentiary of Croäxaxica , deigned to bring with her own hands the reward that was to be given you for your fidelity and zeal , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine to the two Royal and Matrimonial attendants , as they were withdrawing with many obeisances , `` Nay , tell them more , tell them that Raucacoäxine , Queen of the inimitable Croäxaxicans , thanked you , faithful servants of my son . ''
`` And King Brekekex and also Kekebrex the Troubadour will put you in his poem , '' added Brekekex .
But this brought him a heavy blow .
Queen Raucacoäxine forthwith inquired whether he seriously thought of carrying his poem beyond the Execution which was its legitimate termination and should have been Daffodil 's , and she insisted that he should then and there destroy , as dangerous to the State of Croäxaxica , all portions of his manuscript trespassing beyond that limit , and renounce for ever all continuance of Daffodil 's history from the time when , according to all principles of loyalty , she ceased to have an existence .
Brekekex submitted to the hard necessity with a saddened heart , but he became consoled when it had occurred to everybody that Daffo - page : 400 dil 's death in the Boa Constrictor 's mouth made a much finer theme for history than what had really happened , and would be just the thing to wind up a poem .
`` It shall be , '' he said with enthusiasm .
`` Yes , yes , the tale of the death of the remorseful High Traitor whose weapon nearly killed me shall thrill Croäxaxica for ever - and Grachidichika too , for they will be able to afford to buy books there now .
Oh !
my heart has bled with the sacrifice I have just made for our people 's good  but , in the stupendous idea I have just conceived , I have my reward . ''
Queen Raucacoäxine was beaming .
`` This is very pleasing , '' she said to King Logaplop .
`` Is n't it ?
Everything turning out so well , and everybody behaving so beautifully and getting so nicely rewarded . ''
`` I approve highly , '' answered the King , for , although he had not broken his dozes often enough to know what had passed , he was always awake enough to be aware that he could have full confidence in Queen Raucacoäxine 's views .
But now a storm was to break the calm of satisfaction .
It had struck the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician that they might as well get some credit too , and , at the same time , free themselves from risk of their share in the conspiracy coming out at a less favourable moment .
The Regius Professor began `` I feel it my duty to confess , in deep humility , though with pardonable pride - '' `` I desire to own , with regret and loyal rejoicing - '' the Head Royal Physician broke in , not to be forestalled .
page : 401 `` My successful share in the operations for which - '' the Regius Professor went on .
`` The animated part I took in the proceedings that caused - '' the Head Royal Physician was saying .
`` What is it ? ''
said Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` Why do you both talk at once ?
Go on , whichever began first . ''
`` I helped in her defunct Pre-eminence 's rescue , '' they both declared in a hurry .
`` Traitors ! ''
screamed Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` To the Boa Constrictor both of you !
I was sure somebody had disobeyed me . ''
No excuse , no prayers of theirs , no entreaties for them , could pacify her .
They were Croäxaxican officials , they were her own doctor and former tutor , she had actually allowed them to give her advice in State and family affairs : nothing could extenuate their obeying some one else instead of her .
And , having told them this , she commanded them to go at once and deliver themselves to the Lieutenant of the State Prison , to await in his custody their being taken to Sentence and Execution next morning .
The culprits ' wail of despair at this fatal order disturbed the King again .
`` What is it ? ''
he asked drowsily .
`` High Treason - the worst High Treason .
They must undergo the penalty , '' said Raucacoäxine passionately .
`` Wake up and approve . ''
`` Of course I approve , '' said King Logaplop , sinking back into his slumbers .
All intercession for them having been peremp - page : 402 torily rejected by the enraged Queen , the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician were piteously going away to their doom , when Daffodil bethought herself of a last resource .
`` Your Majesty , '' she said , `` I have something to say before they go , to try to get you to change your mind . ''
`` Then , be silent , '' said Queen Raucacoäxine .
`` All I have to say , '' continued Daffodil , `` is that I pledge my word that , if they are not pardoned , I wo n't go out at the Throne Hall roof to-night . ''
The Queen sank into her chair , confounded .
There was silence .
`` After everything was so beautifully settled ! ''
gasped the Queen when she had somewhat recovered herself .
`` It would be a pity , '' said Daffodil .
`` You SHALL go out at the Throne Hall roof to-night , '' said the Queen with vehement determination .
`` There ! ''
said Daffodil triumphantly .
`` They are pardoned .
Saying that was the same as pardoning them . ''
Queen Raucacoäxine gazed at her  and then gazed at everybody , one by one , with an air of surprise .
`` It is the same thing , now I come to think of it , '' she said presently .
And then , with even more than Royal dignity , she signed to the culprits to approach .
`` You have heard your pardon from my own lips , '' she said .
`` Deserve it . ''
`` We will , we do - a thousandfold ! ''
cried the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician .
page : 403 `` I do n't know about that - Moderate your arithmetic , '' said Raucacoäxine .
`` And just hold your tongues and let me speak .
I desire to say that I consider that , on the whole , since you must have learned from my son , the then second Prince of Croäxaxica , that your improper conduct was an act of loyalty in rendering his obedience as to his marriage possible , I see grounds for rewarding your conduct , although on the other hand I have pardoned much in pardoning your disobedience . ''
The Regius Professor and the Head Royal Physician , already on their knees , tried to kneel deeper in sign of submission and thankfulness .
They looked so very submissive and so very thankful that Queen Raucacoäxine turned her anger upon another channel .
`` Nobody is in fault but the State Boa Constrictor , '' she exclaimed .
`` But it shall have its punishment .
It shall never , never , never , swallow a High Traitor again .
It shall always be filled with mushrooms before an execution . ''
`` Splendid '' cried everybody .
`` It deserves it . ''
`` But where shall the traitors go after execution ? ''
inquired , in suggestive tones , the Crown Prince .
`` Oh ! ''
said Queen Raucacoäxine `` their safety is of no consequence to us .
They wo n't exist , from any legal point of view , and they must manage as they can .
Besides , I do n't see how there can be any High Traitors for the future .
I was afraid Happypool might require executing at last  but he is loyalty itself , I find . ''
`` So am I , '' shouted the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician .
`` Who would n't be loyal to the most inimitable page : 404 King and Queen the inimitable Croäxaxicans ever had ? ''
cried the Regius Professor of Everything .
`` Who would n't be loyal to the greatest perfection of dancing , as a Queen , and the greatest perfection of grave demeanour , as a King , Croäxaxica ever had ? ''
cried the Head Royal Physician .
And at these proofs of devotion Queen Raucacoäxine was so much rejoiced that she at once ordered for each of them a new badge of special distinction , to be made with actually a Royal Wedding-Lily petal in the centre .
But - I must tell it now , for I shall not have another chapter for the telling - the Regius Professor of Everything and the Head Royal Physician had been so frightened that they thenceforth longed to withdraw from the prominence they enjoyed at the Court of Croäxaxica .
King Brekekex and Queen Croässaquagha , their constant friends , assisted them by asking for their services and , under the excuse of their advancing age , they retired to Grachidichika , where suites of apartments were built for their habitation in the Royal Palace itself , and they received , besides the titles respectively of Royal Minister of Things in General and Royal Minister of All Medical Science , each that of Official Under-Prince of Grachidichika .
The posts they left vacant in Croäxaxica were bestowed on the nephew and pupil of the Regius Professor , who was a bachelor , and the grandson and pupil of the Head Royal Physician , who was a widower , and these their successors became scarcely second to themselves in the renown they achieved in their learned and courtly career .
Amid the unparalleled honours they enjoyed in Grachi - page : 405 dichika , the two Official Under-Princes could magnanimously approve this conduct of their successors , and regard it , not as rivalry , but an imitation which did but augment their own greatness , as the tutors , relatives , and predecessors in office , of the two new marvels of the learned world .
The splashes denoting the hour for dressing for dinner sounded while talk of farewell was passing affectionately between Daffodil and her Royal friends .
Brekekex and Croässaquagha remained even after the others had fled alarmed at being late  but they too had to tear themselves away .
`` We will not say good-bye yet , '' they murmured .
And the consequence was they never said it .
page : 406 CHAPTER XXVII .
THE Royal Sociable Evening had been begun much earlier than usual , in order that its pleasures might not be curtailed and there might , nevertheless , be time , before the morrow began by the clock , for Daffodil 's passage forth to the regions whence she had come to Croäxaxica .
But the enjoyments of the evening were so great and so many that the hours for them scarcely sufficed and it was almost to-morrow when Queen Raucacoäxine , startled to find how late it was , gave the signal for the breaking up of the party .
Daffodil had been for a long while in anxious suspense when , in a tearing hurry , the Crown Prince came to convey her to the Royal Throne Hall .
`` Has not to-morrow begun ? ''
she asked , with a tremor in her voice .
`` I do n't think so , '' he said .
`` Take my hand and spring with me as hard as you can . ''
All the servants within the Palace had gone to bed , and the Crown Prince had ordered away the sentries at the entrance from the private grounds to his part of the Palace , telling them his apartments were quite safe for that night without them , and page : 407 they should have a holiday in honour of the visit of the King and Queen of Grachidichika .
He was able to lead Daffodil in secrecy to the Great Throne Hall .
There Queen Raucacoäxine , her two elder daughters , the Crown Princess , Brekekex and Croässaquagha , the Professor of Everything , and the Head Royal Physician were assembled , having stolen thither by different ways .
Brekekex and Croässaquagha had brought with them , too , their Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet and their Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - maid , whose services might be useful and who had begged they might be allowed to attend Daffodil 's departure .
The Throne Hall was a blaze of brightness , all the lighting-water having been turned on to the fullest , in the hurry , but Daffodil 's eyes grew too full of tears for her to see friends ' faces that she knew she could never see again .
And there were sounds of `` Oh what a pity she must go ! ''
`` Dear Daffodil ! ''
`` Oh wo n't she ever come back to us ? ''
But there was no time left now for last kind words and farewells .
Quickly there was formed a living ladder , such as they use in Croäxaxica : the Royal and Matrimonial Chief Valet , the Head Royal Physician , the Regius Professor of Everything , King Brekekex , and the Crown Prince , stood , one on the other 's shoulders , and then , when it was seen that the height attained would not suffice for Daffodil , who could not spring as the Croäxaxicans can , to gain the ceiling safely , Princess Guachapeara and Queen Croässaquagha sprang lightly upwards from one member of the ladder to another and added themselves to its length .
The Head Royal and Matrimonial Lady 's - page : 408 maid would have liked to give her service , but it was not possible to allow her to stand on the Royal Family and , for want of time , the ladder could not be formed anew to put her in the lower part .
`` Make haste , Daffodil , '' all cried  for the latest minute was at hand .
She sprang up the friendly ladder and , bounding on , caught a tuft of pendant lily-leaves and swung herself by them to the roof .
Resting in a knotted tangle of lilies and bulrushes , she drew from her pouch the shell with the elf-cup , and touched the roof with the flower .
Instantly there was a rift  it widened  a strong air seemed to seize her and suck her upwards before she was aware - `` Oh good-bye , '' she cried `` good-b - '' And she was away from those to whom she spoke , up above , struggling to rise from the black mud at the bottom of the river .
She had not to struggle long .
There were river people waiting for her in that perilous moment : they caught her in their arms and drew her up to the surface of the water .
She did not know whence the help came , but she felt the supporting clasp and rested in it , floating to the shore .
It was night - summer night , but she felt chill in the unaccustomed air  and there was only the glitter of stars for light .
She could not tell how to find her way home through the wood .
She lay down on the bank , faint and cold .
The river people sang her to sleep , and kept her sheltered , and when the sun rose they placed her where the rays fell warm upon her .
And some of the river maidens washed away all the mud from her , and dressed her in clothes woven of the silky fringes of shell-fishes - page : 409 clothes that shone gently as if they had been woven of moonbeams and sea water and that were as soft as down .
And they combed the sunbeams into her hair , so that , though it had grown dimmed below , it sparkled more than ever .
When the day had really begun , the river people kissed her and left her to awake alone .
Her heart was full of her home now  she had no need to try to remember .
She went bounding to the house , in her Croäxaxican way , and old Keziah thought it was a river maiden , clothed in a wave , bursting through the air  but the cat and the dog knew her at once and rushed to her with every sort of welcoming din they could force out of their throats .
Keziah 's delight when she found the wonderful girl was her own Daffodil was extreme , you may be sure .
As to the joy of the father , mother , and daughter , when they were together again , I shall not say anything , for everybody who has had a father and mother and everybody who has had a child will know about it without my telling , and nobody else need read this story .
Daffodil found her shell in her hand when she awoke on the river bank  but the elf-cup had vanished .
And no new elf-cup grew in her shell .
There did sprout there some of the little beads , but she could find no means of keeping them alive : they shrivelled , then vanished without a trace .
And she never found another elf-cup .
So she never had it in her power to pay a second visit to Croäxaxica .
THE END .
