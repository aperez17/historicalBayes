CHARACTERS


SAKAH ORMEHOD , An old woman EMMA BRIERLEY , A young woman THE REV. FRANK ALLEYNE , A curate SAM HORROCKS , A young man THE SCENE represents the interior of a cottage in a Lancashire village .
Through the window at the back the gray row of cottages opposite is just visible .
The outside door is next to the window .
Door left .
As regards furniture the room is very bare .
The suggestion is not of an empty room , but a stripped room .
For example , there are several square patches where the distemper of the walls is of a darker shade than the rest , indicating the places once occupied by pictures .
There is an uncovered deal the left wall is a dresser and a plate-rack above it containing a few pots .
The dresser has also one or two utensils upon it .
A blackened kettle rests on the top of the cooking-range , but the room contains only the barest necessities .
The floor is uncarpeted .
There are no window curtains , but a yard of cheap muslin is fastened across the window , not coming , however , high enough to prevent a passer-by from looking in , should he wish to do so .
On the floor , near the fire , is a battered black tin trunk , the lid of which is raised .
On a peg behind the door left is a black silk skirt and bodice and an old-fashioned beaded bonnet .
The time is afternoon .
As the curtain rises the room is empty .
Immediately , however , the door left opens and SARAH ORMEROD , an old woman , enters , carrying clumsily in her arms a couple of pink flannelette nightdresses , folded neatly .
Her black stuff dress is well worn , and her wedding-ring is her only ornament .
She wears elastic-sided boots , and her rather short skirt shows a pair of gray worsted stockings .
A small plaid shawl covers her shoulders .
SARAH crosses and puts the nightdresses on the table , surveying the trunk ruefully .
There is a knock at the outside door and she looks up .


SARAH .
Who 's theer ?


EMMA ( without ) .
It 's me , Mrs. Ormerod , Emma Brierley .


SARAH .
Eh , coom in , Emma , lass .


( Enter EMMA BRIERLEY .
She is a young weaver , and , having just left her work , she wears a dark skirt , a blouse of some indeterminate blue-gray shade made of cotton , and a large shawl over her head and shoulders in place of a jacket and hat .
A colored cotton apron covers her skirt below the waist , and the short skirt displays stout stockings similar to Sarah 's .
She wears clogs , and the clothes - except the shawl - are covered with ends of cotton and cotton-wool fluff .
Even her hair has not escaped .
A pair of scissors hangs by a cord from her waist . )


SARAH .
Tha 's kindly welcoom .
It 's good o ' thee to think o ' coomin ' to see an ould woman like me .


EMMA ( by door ) .
Nought o ' th ' sort , Mrs. Ormerod .
Th ' mill 's just loosed and A thowt A 'd step in as A were passin ' and see ` ow tha was feeling like .


SARAH ( crossing to box ) .
Oh , nicely , nicely , thankee .
It 's only my ` ands as is gone paralytic , tha knaws , an ' a weaver 's no manner o ' good to nobody without th ' use o ' ` er ` ands .
A 'm all reeght in masel ' .
That 's worst of it .


EMMA .
Well , while A 'm ` ere , Mrs. Ormerod , is theer nought as A can do for thee ?


SARAH .
A dunno as theer is , thankee , Emma .


EMMA ( taking her shawl off , looking round and hanging it on a peg in the door ) .
Well , A knaws better .
What wert doin ' when A coom in ?
Packin ' yon box ?


SARAH .
Aye .
Tha sees theer 's a two three things as A canna bear thowt o ' parting from .
A do n't reeghtly knaw if they 'll let me tak ' 'em into workus wi ' me , but A canna have 'em sold wi ' rest of stuff .


EMMA ( crosses below SARAH to box , going on her knees ) .
Let me help yo ' .


SARAH .
Tha 's a good lass , Emma .
A'd tak ' it kindly of thee .


EMMA .
They 'd do wi ' packin ' a bit closer .
A dunno as they 'd carry safe that road .


SARAH .
A know .
It 's my ` ands , tha sees , as mak 's it difficult for me .


( Sits on chair . )


EMMA .
Aye .
A 'll soon settle 'em a bit tighter .


( Lifts all out , buries her arms in the box , and rearranges its contents . )


SARAH .
But what 's ` appened to thy looms , lass ?
They 'll not weave by 'em selves while thee 's ` ere , tha knows .


EMMA ( looking round ) .
Eh , looms is all reeght .
Factory 's stopped .
It 's Saturday afternoon .
SARAH .
So 't is .
A'd clean forgot .
A do forget time o ' th ' week sittin ' ` ere day arter day wi ' nought to do .


EMMA .
So that 's all reeght .
Tha 's no need to worry about me .
Tha 's got trouble enough of thy own .
( Resuming at the box )


SARAH .
Aye , th ' art reeght theer , lass .
Theer 's none on us likes to think o ' goin ' to workus when we 're ould .


EMMA .
` Appen it 'll be all reeght after all .
Parson 's coomin ' to see thee .


SARAH .
Aye , A knaw ' e is .
A dunno , but A 'm in ` opes ` e 'll do summat for me .
Tha ca n't never tell what them folks can do .


EMMA ( kneeling up ) .
Tha keep thy pecker oop , Mrs. Ormerod .
That 's what my moother says to me when A tould ` er A were coomin ' in to thee .
Keep ` er pecker oop , she says .
It 's not as if she 'd been lazy or a wastrel , she says  Sal Ormerod 's bin a ` ard worker in ` er day , she says .
It 's not as if it were thy fault .
Tha ca n't ` elp tha ` ands goin ' paralytic .


( She continues rummaging in the trunk while speaking . )


SARAH .
Naw .
It 's not my fault .
God knaws A 'm game enough for work , ould as A am .
A allays knawed as A 'd ` ave to work for my living all th ' days o ' my life .
A never was a savin ' sort .


EMMA .
Theer 's nowt against thee for that .
Theer 's soom as can be careful o ' theer brass an ' soom as ca n't .
It 's not a virtue , it 's a gift .
That 's what my moother allays says .


( Resumes packing . )


SARAH .
She 's reeght an ' all .
We never ` ad the gift o ' savin ' , my man and me .
An ' when Tom Ormerod took an ' died , the club money as A drew all went on ` is funeral an ' ` is gravestone .
A war n't goin ' to ` ave it said as ' e war n't buried proper .


EMMA .
It were a beautiful funeral , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
Aye .


EMMA .
A will say that , beautiful it were .
A never seen a better , an ' A goes to all as A can .
( Rises . )
A dotes on buryin 's .
Are these the next ?


( Crosses before table for nightdresses , takes the nightdresses and resumes packing . )


SARAH .
Aye


( Emma puts them in and rests on her knees listening to Sarah 's next speech . )


SARAH ( pause ) .
A 've been a ` ouseproud woman all my life , Emma , an ' A 've took pride in ` avin ' my bits o ' sticks as good as another 's .
Even th ' manager 's missus oop to factory ` ouse theer , she never ` ad a better show o ' furniture nor me , though A says it as should n't .
An ' it tak 's brass to keep a decent ` ouse over your yead .
An ' we allays ` ad our full week 's ` ollydayin ' at Blackpool reg ` lar at Wakes time .
Us did n't ` ave no childer o ' our own to spend it on , an ' us spent it on ourselves .
A allays ` ad a plenty o ' good food in th ' ` ouse an ' never stinted nobody , an ' Tom ' e liked ` is beer an ' ` is baccy . '
E were a pigeon-fancier , too , in ` is day , were my Tom , an ' pigeon-fancying runs away wi ' a mint o ' money .
No .
Soom ` ow theer never was no brass to put in th ' bank .
We was allays spent oop coom wages neeght .


EMMA .
A knaw , Mrs. Ormerod .
May be A 'm young , but A knaw ` ow 't is .
We works cruel ` ard in th ' mill , an ' when us plays , us plays as ` ard too ( pause ) , an ' small blame to us either .
It 's our own we 're spendin ' .


SARAH .
Aye .
It 's a ` ard life , the factory ` and 's .
A can mind me many an ' many 's the time when th ' warnin ' bell went on th ' factory lodge at ha ' f past five of a winter 's mornin ' as A 've craved for another ha ' f hour in my bed , but Tom ' e got me oop an ' we was never after six passin ' through factory gates all th ' years we were wed. .
There 's not many as can say they were never late .
`` Work or clem , '' that were what Tom allays tould me th ' ould bell were sayin ' .
An ' ' e were reeght , Emma .
`` Work or clem '' is God 's truth .
( EMMA 'S head in box . )
An ' now th ' time 's coom when A ca n't work no more .
But Parson 's a good man , ` e 'll mak ' it all reeght .
( EMMA 'S head appears . )
Eh , it were good o ' thee to coom in , lass .
A bit o ' coompany do mak ' a world o ' difference .
A 'm twice as cheerful as A were .


EMMA .
A 'm glad to ` ear tha say so , Mrs. Ormerod .
( Rises from the box . )
Is theer owt else ?


SARAH .
A were thinkin ' A 'd like to tak ' my black silk as A 've worn o ' Sundays this many a year , but A canna think it 's reeght thing for workus .


EMMA .
Oh , thee tak ' it , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
A'd dearly love to .
Tha sees A 'm noan in debt , nobbut what chairs an table ` ull payfor , and A doa n't like thowt o ' leaving owt as A 'm greatly fond of .


EMMA .
Yo doa n't , Mrs. Ormerod .
Thee tak ' it .
Wheer is it ?
A 'll put un in .
Theer 's lots o'room on top .
A 'll see un 's noan crushed .


SARAH .
It 's hanging theer behind door .
( EMMA crosses back to door , gets clothes . )
A got un out to show Parson .
A thowt A 'd ask un if it were proper to tak ' it if A 've to go .
My best bonnet 's with it , an ' all .


( EMMA goes below table , takes the frock and bonnet , folds it on the table , and packs it . )


EMMA .
A 'll put un in .


SARAH .
A 'm being a lot o ' trouble to thee , lass .


EMMA .
That 's nowt  neighbors mun be neighborly .


( Gets bonnet from table and packs it . )


SARAH ( after a pause , looking round ) .
Place doa n't look much , an ' that 's a fact .
Th ' furniture 's bin goin ' bit by bit , and theer ai n't much left to part wi ' now .


EMMA .
Never mind  it ` ull be all reeght now Parson 's takken thee oop .


SARAH .
A 'm hopin ' so .
A am hopin ' so .
A never could abide th ' thowt o ' th ' workus - me as ` as bin an ` ard-workin ' woman .
A could n't fancy sleepin ' in a strange bed wi ' strange folk round me , an ' when th ' Matron said , `` Do that , '' A 'd ` ave to do it , an ' when she said , `` Go theer , '' A 'd ` ave to a ' gone wheer she tould me - me as ` as allays ` eld my yead ` igh an ' gone the way A pleased masel ' .
Eh , it 's a terrible thowt , the workus .


EMMA ( rising ) .
Now tha 's sure that 's all ?


SARAH ( after a pause , considers ) .
Eh , if A havna forgot my neeghtcaps .
( Rises , moves centre and stops . )
A suppose they 'll let me wear un in yonder .
A doa n't reeghtly think as A 'd get my rest proper wi'out my neeghtcaps .


EMMA .
Oh , they 'll let thee wear un all reeght .


SARAH ( as she goes ) .
A 'll go an ' get un .
( Exit right , returning presently with the white nightcaps . )
That 's all now .


( Gives them to EMMA who meets her at centre . )


EMMA ( putting them in ) .
Yo ' never ` ad no childer , did yo ' , Mrs. Ormerod ?
SARAH .
No , Emma , no - maybe that 's as broad as 's long .
( Sits above fire . )
Yo ' never knaw ` ow they go .
Soom on 'em turn again yo ' when they 're growed , or they get wed themselves an ' forget all as yo ' 've done for 'em , like a many A could name , and they 're allays a worrit to yo ' when they 're young .


EMMA .
A 'm gettin ' wed masel ' soon , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
Are yo ' , now , Emma ?
Well , tha art not one o ' them graceless good-for-nowts .
Tha 'll never forget thy moother , A knaw , nor what she 's done for thee .
Who 's tha keepin ' coompany with ?


EMMA .
It 's Joe Hindle as goes wi ' me , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
` Indle , ` Indle ?
What , not son to Robert ` Indle , ` im as used to be overlooker in th ' factory till ' e went to foreign parts to learn them Roossians ` ow to weave ?


EMMA .
Aye , that 's ` im .


SARAH .
Well , A dunno aught about th ' lad .
` Is faither were a fine man .
A minds ` im well .
But A 'll tell thee this , Emma , an ' A 'll tell it thee to thy faice , ` e 's doin ' well for ` isself , is young Joe ` Indle .


EMMA .
Thankee , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
Gettin ' wed !
Think o ' that .
Why , it seems as 't were only t ` other day as tha was runnin ' about in short frocks , an ' now tha 's growed up and gettin ' thasel ' wed !
Time do run on .
Sithee , Emma , tha 's a good lass , A 've gotten an ould teapot in yonder ( indicating her bedroom ) as my moother give me when A was wed. .
A were n't for packing it in box because o ' risk o ' breaking it .
A were going to carry it in my ` and .
A'd a mind to keep it till A died , but A reckon A 'll ` ave no use for it in workus .


EMMA .
Tha 's not gone theer yet .


SARAH .
Never mind that .
( Slowly rises . )
A 'm going to give it thee , lass , for a weddin ' gift .
Tha 'll tak ' care of it , A knaw , and when thy eye catches it , ` appen tha 'll spare me a thowt .


EMMA .
Oh , no , Mrs. Ormerod , A could n't think o ' takkin ' it .


SARAH .
Art too proud to tak ' a gift from me ?


EMMA .
No .
Tha knaws A 'm not .


SARAH .
Then hold thy hush .
A 'll be back in a minute .
Happen A 'd best tidy masel ' up too against Parson cooms .


EMMA .
Can A help thee , Mrs. Ormerod ?


SARAH .
No , lass , no .
A can do a bit for masel ' .
My ` ands is n't that bad  A canna weave wi ' 'em , but A can do all as A need do .


EMMA .
Well , A 'll do box up .


( Crosses to table right and gets cord . )


SARAH .
Aye .


EMMA .
All reeght .


( Exit SARAH .
A man 's face appears outside at the window .
He surveys the room , and then the face vanishes as he knocks at the door . )


Who 's theer ?


SAM ( without ) .
It 's me , Sam Horrocks .
( EMMA crosses left and opens door . )
May A coom in ?


EMMA .
What dost want ?


SAM ( on the doorstep ) .
A want a word wi ' thee , Emma Brierley .
A followed thee oop from factory and A 've bin waitin ' out theer till A 'm tired o ' waitin ' .


EMMA .
Well , tha'd better coom in .
A ` ave n't time to talk wi ' thee at door .


( EMMA lets him in , closes door , and , leaving him standing in the middle of the room , resumes work on her knees at the box .
SAM HORROCKS is a hulking young man of a rather vacant expression .
He is dressed in mechanic 's blue dungarees .
His face is oily and his clothes stained .
He wears boots , not clogs .
He mechanically takes a ball of oily black cotton-waste from his right pocket when in conversational difficulties and wipes his hands upon it .
He has a red muffler round his neck without collar , and his shock affair hair is surmounted by a greasy black cap , which covers perhaps one tenth of it . )


SAM ( after watching EMMA 's back for a moment ) .
Wheer 's Mrs. Ormerod ?
EMMA ( without looking up ) .
What 's that to do wi ' thee ?


SAM ( apologetically ) .
A were only askin ' .
Tha need n't be short wi ' a chap .


EMMA .
She 's in scullery washin ' ` er , if tha wants to knaw .


SAM .
Oh !


EMMA ( looking at him over her shoulder after a slight pause ) .
Doa n't tha tak ' thy cap off in ` ouse , Sam Horrocks ?
SAM .
Naw .


EMMA .
Well , tha can tak ' it off in this ` ouse or get t 't ` other side o ' door .


SAM .
( Takes off his cap and stuffs it in his left pocket after trying his right and finding the ball of waste in it . )
Yes , Emma .


( EMMA resumes work with her back towards him and waits for him to speak .
But he is not ready yet . )


EMMA .
Well , what dost want ?


SAM .
Nought .
- Eh , but tha art a gradely wench .


EMMA .
What 's that to do wi ' thee ?


SAM .
Nought .


EMMA .
Then just tha mind thy own business , an ' doa n't pass compliments behind folks ' backs .


SAM .
A did n't mean no ` arm .


EMMA .
Well ?


SAM .
It 's a fine day , is n't it ?
For th ' time o ' th ' year ?


EMMA .
Aye .


SAM .
A very fine day .


EMMA .
Aye .


SAM ( desperately ) .
It 's a damned fine day .


EMMA .
Aye .


SAM ( after a moment ) .
Dost know my ` ouse , Emma ?


EMMA .
Aye .


SAM .
Wert ever in it ?


EMMA .
Not sin ' tha moother died .


SAM .
Naw .
A suppose not .
Not sin ' ma moother died .
She were a fine woman , ma moother , for all she were bed-ridden .


EMMA .
She were better than ` er son , though that 's not saying much neither .


SAM .
Naw , but tha does mind ma ` ouse , Emma , as it were when she were alive ?


EMMA .
Aye .


SAM .
A 've done a bit at it sin ' them days .
Got a new quilt on bed from Co-op .
Red un , it is , wi ' blue stripes down ` er .


EMMA .
Aye .


SAM .
Well , Emma ?


EMMA ( over her shoulder ) .
Well , what ?
What 's thy ` ouse an ' thy quilt to do wi ' me ?


SAM .
Oh , nought .
- Tha does n't ` elp a feller much , neither .


EMMA .
( Rises and faces him .
SAM is behind corner table and backs a little before her . )
What 's tha gettin ' at , Sam Horrocks ?
Tha 's got a tongue in thy faice , has n't tha ?


SAM .
A suppose so .
A doa n't use it much though .


EMMA .
No .
Tha 's not much better than a tongue-tied idiot , Sam Horrocks , allays mooning about in th ' engine-house in daytime an ' sulkin ' at ` ome neeghttime .


SAM .
Aye , A 'm lonely sin ' ma moother died .
She did ` ave a way wi ' ` er , ma moother .
Th ' ` ould plaice ` as not bin t' same to me sin ' she went .
Daytime , tha knaws , A 'm all reeght .
Tha sees , them engines , them an ' me 's pals .
They talks to me an ' A understands their ways .
A doa n't some'ow seem to understand th ' ways o ' folks like as A does th ' ways o ' them engines .


EMMA .
Tha does n't try .
T ' other lads goes rattin ' or dog-feeghtin ' on a Sunday or to a football match of a Saturday afternoon .
Tha stays moonin ' about th ' ` ouse .
Tha 's not likely to understand folks .
Tha 's not sociable .


SAM .
Naw .
That 's reeght enough .
A nobbut get laughed at when A tries to be sociable an ' stand my corner down at th ' pub wi ' th ' rest o ' th ' lads .
It 's no use ma tryin ' to soop ale  A ca n't carry th ' drink like t' others .
A knaws A 've ways o ' ma own .


EMMA .
Tha has that .


SAM .
A 'm terrible lonesome , Emma .
That theer ` ouse o ' mine , it do want a wench about th ' plaice .
Th ' engines is all reeght for days , but th ' neeghts is that lonesome-like tha would n't believe .


EMMA .
Tha 's only thasel ' to blame .
It 's nought to do wi ' me , choosehow .


SAM .
Naw ?
A'd - A 'd ` oped as ` ow it might ` ave , Emma .


EMMA ( approaching threateningly ) .
Sam Horrocks , if tha doa n't tell me proper what tha means A 'll give tha such a slap in th ' mouth .


SAM ( backing before her ) .
Tha does fluster a feller , Emma .
Just like ma moother .


EMMA .
A wish A ` ad bin .
A'd ` ave knocked some sense into thy silly yead .


SAM ( suddenly and clumsily kneels above chair left of table ) .
Wilt tha ` ave me , Emma ?
A mak ' good money in th ` engine-house .
EMMA .
Get oop , tha great fool .
If tha did n't keep thasel ' so close wi ' tha moonin ' about in th ' engine - ` ouse an ' never speakin ' a word to nobody , tha'd knaw A were keepin ' coompany wi ' Joe Hindle .


SAM ( scrambling up ) .
Is that a fact , Emma ?


EMMA .
Of course it 's a fact .
Banns ` ull be oop come Sunday fortneeght .
We 've not ` idden it neither .
It 's just like the great blind idiot that tha art not to ` a ' seen it long enough sin ' .


SAM .
A wer 'n' t aware .
By gum , A ` ad so ` oped as tha'd ` ave me , Emma .
EMMA ( a little more softly ) .
A 'm sorry if A 've ` urt thee , Sam .


SAM .
Aye .
It were ma fault .
Eh , well , A think mebbe A 'd best be goin ' .


EMMA ( lifts box to left ) .
Aye .
Parson 's coomin ' to see Mrs. Ormerod in a minute .
SAM ( with pride ) .
A knaw all about that , anyhow .


EMMA .
She 'm in a bad way .
A dunno masel ' as Parson can do much for ` er .


SAM .
It 's ` ard lines on an ould un .
Well , yo ' 'll not want me'ere .
A 'll be movin ' on .
( Getting his cap out ) No offense , Emma , A ` ope .
A'd ` ave asked thee first if A 'd knawn as ' e were after thee .
A 've bin tryin ' for long enough .


EMMA .
No .
Theer 's no offense , Sam .
Tha 's a good lad if tha art a fool , an ' mebbe tha 's not to blame for that .
Good-bye .


SAM .
Good-bye , Emma .
An ' - An ' A ` ope ` e 'll mak ' thee ` appy .
A'd dearly like to coom to th ' weddin ' an ' shake ` is ` and .


( MRS. ORMEROD heard off right . )


EMMA .
A 'll see tha 's asked .
Theer 's Mrs. Ormerod stirrin ' .
Tha'd best be gettin ' .


SAM .
All reeght .
Good-bye , Emma .


EMMA .
Good-bye , Sam .


( Exit SAM left centre .
MRS. ORMEROD comes from the inside door .
She has a small blue teapot in her hand . )


SARAH .
Was anybody ` ere , Emma ?
A thowt A yeard someun talkin ' , only my yearin ' is n't what it used to be , an ' A war n't sure .


EMMA .
It were Sam Horrocks , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
Yon lad of ould Sal Horrocks as died last year ?
` Im as is n't reeght in ` is yead ?


EMMA .
Aye .
` E 's bin askin ' me to wed ` im .


SARAH ( incensed ) .
In my ` ouse ?
Theer 's imperence for thee , an ' tha promised to another lad , an ' all .
A'd ` ave set about ` im wi ' a stick , Emma .


EMMA . '
E did n't knaw about Joe .
It made me feel cruel like to ` ave to tell ` im .


SARAH .
` E 'll get ower it .
Soom lass 'll tak ' ` im .


EMMA .
A suppose so .


SARAH ( coming down , putting the teapot in EMMA 'S hands ) .
Well , theer 's teapot .


EMMA ( meets SARAH right centre , examining teapot ) .
It 's beautiful .
Beautiful , it is , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
Aye , it 's a bit o ' real china is that .
Tha 'll tak ' care o n't , lass , wo n't thee ?


EMMA .
A will an ' all .


SARAH .
Aye .
A knaw it 's safe wi ' thee .
Mebbe safer than it would be in workus .
A ca n't think well on yon plaice .
A goa cold all ower at thowt of it .


( A knock at the door . )


EMMA .
That 'll be Parson .


SARAH ( crosses left , smoothing her hair ) .
Goa an ' look through window first , an ' see who 't is .


EMMA ( puts teapot on table  looking through window ) .
It is not th ' ould Parson .
It 's one o ' them young curate chaps .


SARAH .
Well , coom away from window an ' sit thee down .
It wo n't do to seem too eager .
Let un knock again if it 's not th ' ould Parson .


( EMMA leaves the window and goes to right of table .
The knock is repeated . )


SARAH ( raising her voice ) .
Coom in so who tha art .
Door 's on latch .


( Enter the REV. FRANK ALLEYNE .
He is a young curate , a Londoner and an Oxford man , by association , training , and taste totally unfitted for a Lancashire curacy , in which he is , unfortunately , no exception . )


ALLEYNE .
Good afternoon , Mrs. Ormerod .


SARAH .
Good day to thee .


ALLEYNE .
I 'm sorry to say Mr. Blundell has had to go to a missionary meeting , but he asked me to come and see you in his stead .


SARAH .
Tha 's welcoom , lad .
Sit thee doon .


( EMMA comes below table left .
Dusts a chair , which does n't need it , with her apron .
ALLEYNE raises a deprecatory hand .
SARAH 'S familiarity , as it seems to him , offends him .
He looks sourly at EMMA and markedly ignores her . )


ALLEYNE .
Thank you  no , I wo n't sit  I can not stay long .


SARAH .
Just as tha likes .
It 's all same to me .


( EMMA stays by right of table . )


ALLEYNE .
How is it with you , Mrs. Ormerod ?


SARAH .
It might be worse .
A 've lost th ' use o ' my ` ands , and they 're takin ' me to workus , but A 'm not dead yet , and that 's summat to be thankul for .


ALLEYNE .
Oh , yes , yes , Mrs. Ormerod .
The - er - message I am to deliver is , I fear , not quite what Mr. Blundell led you to hope for .
His efforts on your behalf have - er - - unfortunately failed .
He finds himself obliged to give up all hope of aiding you to a livelihood .
In fact - er - I understand that the arrangements made for your removal to the workhouse this afternoon must be carried out .
It seems there is no alternative .
I am grieved to be the bearer of bad tidings , but I am sure you will find a comfortable home awaiting you , Mrs. - er - Ormerod .


SARAH .
` Appen A shall an ' ` appen A sha n't .
Theer 's no tellin ' ` ow you 'll favor a thing till you 've tried it .


ALLEYNE .
You must resign yourself to the will of Providence .
The consolations of religion are always with us .
Shall I pray with you ?


SARAH .

ALLEYNE .

Can I do nothing for you ?


SARAH .

ALLEYNE .
I am privileged with Mr. Blundell 's permission to bring a little gift to you , Mrs. Ormerod .
( Feeling in his coattails and bringing out a Testament . )
Allow me to present you with this Testament , and may it help you to bear your Cross with resignation .
( He hands her the Testament .
SARAH does not raise her hands , and it drops on her lap .
ALLEYNE takes it again and puts it on the table . )
Ah , yes , of course - your poor hands - I understand .


SARAH .
Thankee kindly .
Readin ' do n't coom easy to me , an ' my eyes are n't what they were , but A 'll mak ' most of it .


ALLEYNE .
You will never read that in vain .
And now , dear sister , I must go .
I will pray for strength for you .
All will be well .
Good day .
SARAH .
Good day to thee .


( Exit ALLEYNE . )

EMMA ( speaking through door ) .
A 'll ask my moother to step hi later on , Mrs. Ormerod , and thank thee very much for th ' teapot .


SARAH .
A 'll be thankful if she 'll coom .
( Exit EMMA with teapot . )
Now , Sam Horrocks , what 's the matter wi ' thee ?
SAM ( dropping the cotton-waste he is fumbling with and picking it up ) .
It 's a fine day for th ' time o ' th ' year .


SARAH .
Didst want to see me private to tell me that , lad ?


SAM .
Naw , not exactly .


SARAH .
Well , what is it then ?
Coom , lad , A 'm waitin ' on thee .

SARAH .

A'd coom aside thee and A 'd box thy ears .
If tha 's got business wi ' me , tha'd best state it sharp or A 'll be showin ' thee the shape o ' my door .


SAM .
Tha do fluster a feller so as A doa n't knaw wheer A am .
A 've not been nagged like that theer sin ' my ould moother died .


SARAH .
A 've ` eerd folk say Sal Horrocks were a slick un wi ' ` er tongue .


SAM ( admiringly ) .
She were that .
Rare talker she were .
She 'd lie theer in ` er bed all day as it might be in yon corner , an ' call me all th ' names she could put her tongue to , till A could n't tell ma reeght ` and from ma left .
( Still reminiscent . )
Wonnerful sperrit , she ` ad , considerin ' she were bed-ridden so long .
She were only a little un an ' cripple an ' all , but by gum , she could sling it at a feller if ` er tea were n't brewed to ` er taste .
Talk !
She 'd talk a donkey 's yead off , she would .


SARAH ( on her mettle ) .
An ' A 'll talk thy silly yead off an ' all if tha doa n't get sharp to tellin ' me what tha wants after in my ` ouse , tha great mazed idiot .


SAM .
Eh , but she were a rare un .


SARAH .
The lad 's daft aboot his moother .


SAM ( detachedly , looking at window  pause ) .
Wunnerful breeght the sky is , to-day .


SARAH .
Tha great ` ulkin ' fool .
A'd tak ' a broomstick to thee if - if A 'd the use o ' my ` ands .


SAM .
Now , if that is n't just what ma moother used to say .


SARAH .
Dang thy moother .
An ' A doa n't mean no disrepect to ` er neither .
She 's bin in ` er grave this year an ' more , poor woman .


SAM .

Eh , but she were wunnerful .


SARAH .
An ' A 'd be wunnerful too .

A'd call thee if A were thy moother an ' A 'd to live aside o ' thee neeght an ' day .


SAM ( eagerly ) .
Eh , by gum , but A wish tha would .


SARAH .

SAM .
Would coom an ' live along wi ' me .


SARAH .
Tha great fool , what does mean ?
Art askin ' me to wed thee ?


SAM .
A did n't mean to offend thee , Mrs. Ormerod .
A 'm sorry A spoke .
A allays do wrong thing .
But A did so ` ope as tha might coom .
Tha sees A got used to moother .
A got used to ` earin ' ` er cuss me .
A got used to doin ' for ` er an ' A 've nought to do in th ' evenings now .
It 's terrible lonesome in th ' neeghttime .
An ' when notion coom to me , A thowt as A 'd mention un to thee casual .


SARAH .
Dost mean it , Sam Horrocks ?
Dost tha know what tha 's sayin ' , or is tha foolin ' me ?


SAM .
O ' course A mean it .
Tha sees A 'm not a marryin ' sort .
Th ' lasses wo n't look at me .
A 'm silly Sam to them , A knaws it .
A 've a slate loose  A sha n't never get wed. .
A thowt A 'd mebbe a chance wi ' yon lass as were ` ere wi ' thee , but hoo towld me A were too late .
A allays were slow .
A left askin ' too long an ' A 've missed ` er .
A gets good money , Mrs. Ormerod , but A canna talk to a young wench .
They mak 's me go ` ot and cowld all over .
An ' when curate towld me as tha was to go to workus , A thowt A 'd a chance wi ' thee .
A knaw'd it were n't a big chance , because my plaice ai n't much cop after what tha 's bin used to ` ere .
A 've got no fine fixin 's nor big chairs an ' things like as tha used to ` ave. Eh , but A would ` ave loved to do for thee as A used to do for ma moother , an ' when A yeerd thee talkin ' now an ' callin ' me a fool an ' th ' rest , by gum , A just yearned to ` ave thee for allays .
Tha'd fill ` er plaice wunnerful well .
A'd just a ' loved to adopt thee .


SARAH .
To adopt me ?


SAM .
Ay , for a moother .
A 'm sorry tha ca n't see thy way to let me .
A did n't mean no offence ( turning to the door ) .

RIDERS TO THE SEA [ 1 ]


J.M. Synge


[ Footnote 1 : Included by permission of Messrs. John W. Luce and Company . ]
CHARACTERS


MAURYA , an old woman BARTLEY , her son CATHLEEN , her daughter NORA , a younger daughter MEN AND WOMEN SCENE : An island off the West of Ireland .
Cottage kitchen , with nets , oilskins , spinning-wheel , some new boards standing by the wall , etc. .
CATHLEEN , a girl of about twenty , finishes kneading cake , and puts it down in the pot-oven by the fire  then wipes her hands , and begins to spin at the wheel .
NORA , a young girl , puts her head in at the door .


NORA ( in a low voice ) .
Where is she ?


CATHLEEN .
She 's lying down , God help her , and maybe sleeping , if she 's able .


( NORA comes in softly , and takes a bundle from under her shawl . )


CATHLEEN ( spinning the wheel rapidly ) .
What is it you have ?


NOBA .
The young priest is after bringing them .
It 's a shirt and a plain stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal .


( CATHLEEN stops her wheel with a sudden movement , and leans out to listen . )


NORA .
We 're to find out if it 's Michael 's they are  some time herself will be down looking by the sea .


CATHLEEN .
How would they be Michael 's , Nora ?
How would he go the length of that way to the far north ?


NORA .
The young priest says he 's known the like of it .
`` If it 's Michael 's they are , '' says he , `` you can tell herself he 's got a clean burial by the grace of God , and if they 're not his , let no one say a word about them , for she 'll be getting her death , '' says he , `` with crying and lamenting . ''


( The door which NORA half closed is blown open by a gust of wind . )


CATHLEEN ( looking out anxiously ) .
Did you ask him would he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to the Galway fair ?
NORA .
`` I wo n't stop him , '' says he , `` but let you not be afraid .
Herself does be saying prayers half through the night , and the Almighty God wo n't leave her destitute , '' says he , `` with no son living . ''
CATHLEEN .
Is the sea bad by the white rocks , Nora ?


NORA .
Middling bad , God help us .
There 's a great roaring in the west , and it 's worse it 'll be getting when the tide 's turned to the wind .


( She goes over to the table with the bundle . )


Shall I open it now ?


CATHLEEN .
Maybe she 'd wake up on us , and come in before we 'd done .
( Coming to the table ) It 's a long time we 'll be , and the two of us crying .


NORA ( goes to the inner door and listens ) .
She 's moving about on the bed .
She 'll be coming in a minute .


CATHLEEN .
Give me the ladder , and I 'll put them up in the turf-loft , the way she wo n't know of them at all , and maybe when the tide turns she 'll be going down to see would he be floating from the east .


( They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney  CATHLEEN goes up a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft .
MAURYA comes from the inner room . )


MAURYA ( looking up at CATHLEEN and speaking querulously ) .
Is n't it turf enough you have for this day and evening ?


CATHLEEN .
There 's a cake baking at the fire for a short space ( throwing down the turf ) and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes to Connemara .


( NORA picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven . )


MAURYA ( sitting down on a stool at the fire ) .
He wo n't go this day with the wind rising from the south and west .
He wo n't go this day , for the young priest will stop him surely .


NORA .
He 'll not stop him , mother , and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he would go .
MAURYA .
Where is he itself ?


NORA .
He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the week , and I 'm thinking it wo n't be long till he 's here now , for the tide 's turning at the green head , and the hooker 's tacking from the east .


CATHLEEN .
I hear someone passing the big stones .


NORA ( looking out ) .
He 's coming now , and he in a hurry .


BARTLEY ( comes in and looks round the room  speaking sadly and quietly ) .
Where is the bit of new rope , Cathleen , was bought in Connemara ?


CATHLEEN ( coming down ) .
Give it to him , Nora  it 's on a nail by the white boards .
I hung it up this morning , for the pig with the black feet was eating it .


NORA ( giving him a rope ) .
Is that it , Bartley ?


MAURYA .
You 'd do right to leave that rope , Bartley , hanging by the boards .
( BARTLEY takes the rope . )
It will be wanting in this place , I 'm telling you , if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning , or the next morning , or any morning in the week , for it 's a deep grave we 'll make him by the grace of God .


BARTLEY ( beginning to work with the rope ) .
I 've no halter the way I can ride down on the mare , and I must go now quickly .
This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond it , and the fair will be a good fair for horses , I heard them saying below .


MAURYA .
It 's a hard thing they 'll be saying below if the body is washed up and there 's no man in it to make the coffin , and I after giving a big price for the finest white boards you 'd find in Connemara .


( She looks round at the boards . )


BARTLEY .
How would it be washed up , and we after looking each day for nine days , and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and south ?


MAURYA .
If it was n't found itself , that wind is raising the sea , and there was a star up against the moon , and it rising in the night .
If it was a hundred horses , or a thousand horses you had itself , what is the price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only ?


BARTLEY ( working at the halter , to CATHLEEN ) .
Let you go down each day , and see the sheep are n't jumping in on the rye , and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if there is a good price going .


MAURYA .
How would the like of her get a good price for a pig ?


BARTLEY ( to CATHLEEN ) .
If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp .
It 's hard set we 'll be from this day with no one in it but one man to work .


MAURYA .
It 's hard set we 'll be surely the day you 're drownd'd with the rest .
What way will I live and the girls with me , and I an old woman looking for the grave ?


( BARTLEY lays down the halter , takes off his old coat , and puts on a newer one of the same flannel . )


BARTLEY ( to NORA ) .
Is she coming to the pier ?


NORA ( looking out ) .
She 's passing the green head and letting fall her sails .


BARTLEY ( getting his purse and tobacco ) .
I 'll have half an hour to go down , and you 'll see me coming again in two days , or in three days , or maybe in four days if the wind is bad .


MAURYA ( turning round to the fire , and putting her shawl over her head ) .
Is n't it a hard and cruel man wo n't hear a word from an old woman , and she holding him from the sea ?


CATHLEEN .
It 's the life of a young man to be going on the sea , and who would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over ?


BARTLEY ( taking the halter ) .
I must go now quickly .
I 'll ride down on the red mare , and the gray pony 'll run behind me .
The blessing of God on you .


( He goes out . )


MAURYA ( crying out as he is in the door ) .
He 's gone now , God spare us , and we 'll not see him again .
He 's gone now , and when the black night is falling I 'll have no son left me in the world .


CATHLEEN .
Why would n't you give him your blessing and he looking round in the door ?
Is n't it sorrow enough is on everyone in this house without your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him , and a hard word in his ear ?


( MAURYA takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without looking round . )


NORA ( turning towards her ) .
You 're taking away the turf from the cake .


CATHLEEN ( crying out ) .
The Son of God forgive us , Nora , we 're after forgetting his bit of bread .


( She comes over to the fire . )


NORA .
And it 's destroyed he 'll be going till dark night , and he after eating nothing since the sun went up .


CATHLEEN ( turning the cake out of the oven ) .
It 's destroyed he 'll be , surely .
There 's no sense left on any person in a house where an old woman will be talking for ever .


( MAURYA sways herself on her stool . )


CATHLEEN ( cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth , to MAURYA ) .
Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing .
You 'll see him then and the dark word will be broken , and you can say , `` God speed you , '' the way he 'll be easy in his mind .


MAURYA ( taking the bread ) .
Will I be in it as soon as himself ?


CATHLEEN .
If you go now quickly .


MAURYA ( standing up unsteadily ) .
It 's hard set I am to walk .


CATHLEEN ( looking at her anxiously ) .
Give her the stick , Nora , or maybe she 'll slip on the big stones .


NORA .
What stick ?


CATHLEEN .
The stick Michael brought from Connemara .


MAURYA ( taking a stick NORA gives her ) .
In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children , but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old .


( She goes out slowly .
NORA goes over to the ladder . )


CATHLEEN .
Wait , Nora , maybe she 'd turn back quickly .
She 's that sorry , God help her , you would n't know the thing she 'd do .


NORA .
Is she gone round by the bush ?


CATHLEEN ( looking out ) .
She 's gone now .
Throw it down quickly , for the Lord knows when she 'll be out of it again .


NORA ( getting the bundle from the loft ) .
The young priest said he 'd be passing to-morrow , and we might go down and speak to him below if it 's Michael 's they are surely .


CATHLEEN ( taking the bundle ) .
Did he say what way they were found ?


NORA ( coming down ) .
`` There were two men , '' says he , `` and they rowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed , and the oar of one of them caught the body , and they passing the black cliffs of the north . ''


CATHLEEN ( trying to open the bundle ) .
Give me a knife , Nora  the string 's perished with the salt water , and there 's a black knot on it you would n't loosen in a week .


NORA ( giving her a knife ) .
I 've heard tell it was a long way to Donegal .
CATHLEEN ( cutting the string ) .
It is surely .
There was a man in here a while ago - the man sold us that knife - and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond , it would be seven days you 'd be in Donegal .


NORA .
And what time would a man take , and he floating ?


( CATHLEEN opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking .
They look at them eagerly . )
CATHLEEN ( in a low voice ) .
The Lord spare us , Nora !
Is n't it a queer hard thing to say if it 's his they are surely ?


NORA .
I 'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on the other .
( She looks through some clothes hanging in the corner ) It 's not with them , Cathleen , and where will it be ?


CATHLEEN .
I 'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning , for his own shirt was heavy with the salt in it .
( Pointing to the corner ) There 's a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff .
Give me that and it will do .


( NORA brings it to her and they compare the flannel . )


CATHLEEN .
It 's the same stuff , Nora  but if it is itself , are n't there great rolls of it in the shops of Galway , and is n't it many another man may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself ?


NORA ( who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches , crying out ) It 's Michael , Cathleen , it 's Michael  God spare his soul and what will herself say when she hears this story , and Bartley on the sea ?


CATHLEEN ( taking the stocking ) .
It 's a plain stocking .


NORA .
It 's the second one of the third pair I knitted , and I put up three score stitches , and I dropped four of them .


CATHLEEN ( counts the stitches ) .
It 's that number is in it .
( Crying out ) Ah , Nora , is n't it a bitter thing to think of him floating that way to the far north , and no one to keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea ?


NORA ( swinging herself round , and throwing out her arms on the clothes ) .
And is n't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who was a great rower and fisher , but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking ?


CATHLEEN ( after an instant ) .
Tell me is herself coming , Nora ?
I hear a little sound on the path .


NORA ( looking out ) .
She is , Cathleen .
She 's coming up to the door .


CATHLEEN .
Put these things away before she 'll come in .
Maybe it 's easier she 'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley , and we wo n't let on we 've heard anything the time he 's on the sea .


NORA ( helping CATHLEEN to close the bundle ) .
We 'll put them here in the corner .


( They put them into a hole in the chimney corner .
CATHLEEN goes back to the spinning wheel . )


NORA .
Will she see it was crying I was ?


CATHLEEN .
Keep your back to the door the way the light 'll not be on you .


( NORA sits down at the chimney corner , with her back to the door .
MAURYA comes in very slowly , without looking at the girls , and goes over to her stool at the other side of the fire .
The cloth with the bread is still in her hand .
The girls look at each other , and NORA points to the bundle of bread . )


CATHLEEN ( offer spinning for a moment ) , You did n't give him his bit of bread ?


( MAURYA begins to keen softly , without turning round . )


CATHLEEN .
Did you see him riding down ?


( MAURYA goes on keening . )


CATHLEEN ( a little impatiently ) .
God forgive you  is n't it a better thing to raise your voice and tell what you seen , than to be making lamentation for a thing that 's done ?
Did you see Bartley , I 'm saying to you .


MAURYA ( with a weak voice ) .
My heart 's broken from this day .


CATHLEEN ( as before ) .
Did you see Bartley ?


MAURYA .
I seen the fearfulest thing .


CATHLEEN ( leaves her wheel and looks out ) .
God forgive you  he 's riding the mare now over the green head , and the gray pony behind him .


MAURYA ( starts , so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her white tossed hair  with a frightened voice ) .
The gray pony behind him .


CATHLEEN ( coming to the fire ) .
What is it ails you , at all ?


MAURYA ( speaking very slowly ) .
I 've seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen , since the day Bride Dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms .


CATHLEEN AND NORA .
Uah .


( They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire . )


NORA .
Tell us what it is you seen .


MAURYA .
I went down to the spring-well , and I stood there saying a prayer to myself .
Then Bartley came along , and he riding on the red mare with the gray pony behind him .
( She puts up her hands , as if to hide something from her eyes . )
The Son of God spare us , Nora !


CATHLEEN .
What is it you seen ?


MAURYA .
I seen Michael himself .


CATHLEEN ( speaking softly ) .
You did not , mother  it was n't Michael you seen , for his body is after being found in the far north , and he 's got a clean burial by the grace of God .


MAURYA ( a little defiantly ) .
I 'm after seeing him this day , and he riding and galloping .
Bartley came first on the red mare  and I tried to say `` God speed you , '' but something choked the words in my throat .
He went by quickly  and , `` The blessing of God on you , '' says he , and I could say nothing .
I looked up then , and I crying , at the gray pony , and there was Michael upon it - with fine clothes on him , and new shoes on his feet .


CATHLEEN ( begins to keen ) .
It 's destroyed we are from this day .
It 's destroyed , surely .
NORA .
Did n't the young priest say the Almighty God would n't leave her destitute with no son living ?


MAUKYA ( in a low voice , but clearly ) .
It 's little the like of him knows of the sea - .
Bartley will be lost now , and let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of the white boards , for I wo n't live after them .
I 've had a husband , and a husband 's father , and six sons in this house - six fine men , though it was a hard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the world - and some of them were found and some of them were not found , but they 're gone now , the lot of them - .
There were Stephen , and Shawn , were lost in the great wind , and found after in the Bay of Gregory of the Golden Mouth , and carried up the two of them on the one plank , and in by that door .


( She pauses for a moment , the girls start as if they heard something through the door that is half-open behind them . )


NORA ( in a whisper ) .
Did you hear that , Cathleen ?
Did you hear a noise in the northeast ?


CATHLEEN ( in a whisper ) .
There 's someone after crying out by the seashore .


MAURYA ( continues without hearing anything ) .
There was Sheamus and his father , and his own father again , were lost in a dark night , and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went up .
There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over .
I was sitting here with Bartley , and he a baby , lying on my two knees , and I seen two women , and three women , and four women coming in , and they crossing themselves , and not saying a word .
I looked out then , and there were men coming after them , and they holding a thing in the half of a red sail , and water dripping out of it - it was a dry day , Nora - and leaving a track to the door .


( She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door .
It opens softly and old women begin to come in , crossing themselves on the threshold , and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats over their heads . )


MAURYA ( half in a dream , to Cathleen ) .
Is it Patch , or Michael , or what is it at all ?


CATHLEEN .
Michael is after being found in the far north , and when he is found there how could he be here in this place ?


MAURYA .
There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea , and what way would they know if it was Michael they had , or another man like him , for when a man is nine days in the sea , and the wind blowing , it 's hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it .


CATHLEEN .
It 's Michael , God spare him , for they 're after sending us a bit of his clothes from the far north .


( She reaches out and hands MAURYA the clothes that belonged to MICHAEL .
MAURYA stands up slowly , and takes them in her hands .
NORA looks out . )


NORA .
They 're carrying a thing among them and there 's water dripping out of it and leaving a track by the big stones .


CATHLEEN ( in a whisper to the women who have come in ) .
Is it Bartley it is ?
ONE OF THE WOMEN .
It is surely , God rest his soul .


( Two younger women come in and pull out the table .
Then men carry in the body of BARTLEY , laid on a plank , with a bit of a sail over it , and lay it on the table . )


CATHLEEN ( to the women , as they are doing so ) .
What way was he drowned ?


ONE OF THE WOMEN .
The gray pony knocked him into the sea , and he was washed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks .


( MAURYA has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table .
The women are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement .
CATHLEEN and NORA kneel at the other end of the table .
The men kneel near the door . )
MAURYA ( raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people around her ) .
They 're all gone now , and there is n't anything more the sea can do to me - .
I 'll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south , and you can hear the surf is in the east , and the surf is in the west , making a great stir with the two noises , and they hitting one on the other .
I 'll have no call now to be going down and getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain , and I wo n't care what way the sea is when the other women will be keening .
( To NORA ) Give me the Holy Water , Nora  there 's a small sup still on the dresser .


( NORA gives it to her . )


MAURYA ( drops MICHAEL 'S clothes across BARTLEY 'S feet , and sprinkles the Holy Water over him ) .
It is n't that I have n't prayed for you , BARTLEY , to the Almighty God .
It is n't that I have n't said prayers in the dark night till you would n't know what I 'd be saying  but it 's a great rest I 'll have now , and it 's time surely .
It 's a great rest I 'll have now , and great sleeping in the long nights after Samhain , if it 's only a bit of wet flour we do have to eat , and maybe a fish that would be stinking .


( She kneels down again , crossing herself , and saying prayers under her breath . )


CATHLEEN ( to an old man ) .
Maybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises .
We have fine white boards herself bought , God help her , thinking Michael would be found , and I have a new cake you can eat while you 'll be working .


THE OLD MAN ( looking at the boards ) .
Are there nails with them ?


CATHLEEN .
There are not , Colum  we did n't think of the nails .


ANOTHER MAN .
It 's a great wonder she would n't think of the nails , and all the coffins she 's seen made already .


CATHLEEN .
It 's getting old she is , and broken .


( MAURYA stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of MICHAEL 'S clothes beside the body , sprinkling them with the last of the Holy Water . )


NORA ( in a whisper to CATHLEEN ) .
She 's quiet now and easy  but the day Michael was drowned you could hear her crying out from this to the spring-well .
It 's fonder she was of Michael , and would anyone have thought that ?


CATHLEEN ( slowly and clearly ) .
An old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do , and is n't it nine days herself is after crying and keening , and making great sorrow in the house ?


MAURYA ( puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table , and lays her hands together on BARTLEY 'S feet ) .
They 're all together this time , and the end is come .
May the Almighty God have mercy on Bartley 's soul , and on Michael 's soul , and on the souls of Sheamus and Patch , and Stephen and Shawn ( bending her head )  and may He have mercy on my soul , Nora , and on the soul of everyone is left living in the world .


( She pauses , and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women , then sinks away . )


MAURYA ( continuing ) .
Michael has a clean burial in the far north , by the grace of the Almighty God .
Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards , and a deep grave surely .
What more can we want than that ?
No man at all can be living for ever , and we must be satisfied .


( She kneels down again , and the curtain falls slowly ) .
