INTRODUCTION


BEGGAR , PLAYER .


Beggar .


If Poverty be a Title to Poetry , I am sure no-body can dispute mine .
I own myself of the Company of Beggars  and I make one at their Weekly Festivals at St. Giles 's .
I have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches , and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please , which is more than most Poets can say .


Player .
As we live by the Muses , it is but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit wherever we find it .
The Muses , contrary to all other Ladies , pay no Distinction to Dress , and never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery for Wit , nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness .
Be the Author who he will , we push his Play as far as it will go .
So ( though you are in Want ) I wish you success heartily .


Beggar .
This piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of James Chaunter and Moll Lay , two most excellent Ballad-Singers .
I have introduced the Similes that are in all your celebrated Operas : The Swallow , the Moth , the Bee , the Ship , the Flower , c. Besides , I have a Prison-Scene , which the Ladies always reckon charmingly pathetic .
As to the Parts , I have observed such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies , that it is impossible for either of them to take Offence .
I hope I may be forgiven , that I have not made my Opera throughout unnatural , like those in vogue  for I have no Recitative  excepting this , as I have consented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue , it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms .
The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our Great Room at St. Giles 's , so that I can not too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage .


Player .
But I see it is time for us to withdraw  the Actors are preparing to begin .
Play away the Overture .

OVERTURE

ACT I. SCENE I .


SCENE , Peachum 's House .


Peachum sitting at a Table with a large Book of Accounts before him .


AIR I .
An old Woman clothed in Gray , c..


[ Music ]


Through all the Employments of Life Each Neighbour abuses his Brother  Whore and Rogue they call Husband and Wife : All Professions be-rogue one another : The Priest calls the Lawyer a Cheat , The Lawyer be-knaves the Divine : And the Statesman , because he 's so great , Thinks his Trade as honest as mine .


A Lawyer is an honest Employment , so is mine .
Like me too he acts in a double Capacity , both against Rogues and for 'em  for 't is but fitting that we should protect and encourage Cheats , since we live by them .


Enter Filch .


Filch .
Sir , Black Moll hath sent word her Trial comes on in the Afternoon , and she hopes you will order Matters so as to bring her off .


Peachum .
As the Wench is very active and industrious , you may satisfy her that I 'll soften the Evidence .


Filch .
Tom Gagg , Sir , is found guilty .


Peachum .
A lazy Dog !
When I took him the time before , I told him what he would come to if he did not mend his Hand .
This is Death without Reprieve .
I may venture to Book him [ writes . ]
For Tom Gagg , forty Pounds .
Let Betty Sly know that I 'll save her from Transportation , for I can get more by her staying in England .


Filch .
Betty hath brought more Goods into our Lock to-year than any five of the Gang  and in truth , 't is a pity to lose so good a Customer .


Peachum .
If none of the Gang take her off , she may , in the common course of Business , live a Twelve-month longer .
I love to let Women scape .
A good Sportsman always lets the Hen Partridges fly , because the Breed of the Game depends upon them .
Besides , here the Law allows us no Reward  there is nothing to be got by the Death of Women -- except our Wives .


Filch .
Without dispute , she is a fine Woman !
'T was to her I was obliged for my Education , and ( to say a bold Word ) she hath trained up more young Fellows to the Business than the Gaming table .


Peachum .
Truly , Filch , thy Observation is right .
We and the Surgeons are more beholden to Women than all the Professions besides .


AIR II .
The bonny gray-ey'd Morn , c..


[ Music ]


Filch .
'T is Woman that seduces all Mankind , By her we first were taught the wheedling Arts : Her very Eyes can cheat  when most she 's kind , She tricks us of our Money with our Hearts .
For her , like Wolves by Night we roam for Prey , And practise ev'ry Fraud to bribe her Charms  For Suits of Love , like Law , are won by Pay , And Beauty must be fee'd into our Arms .


Peachum .
But make haste to Newgate , Boy , and let my Friends know what I intend  for I love to make them easy one way or other .


Filch .
When a Gentleman is long kept in suspence , Penitence may break his Spirit ever after .
Besides , Certainty gives a Man a good Air upon his Trial , and makes him risk another without Fear or Scruple .
But I 'll away , for 't is a Pleasure to be the Messenger of Comfort to Friends in Affliction .
[ Exit Filch .


Peachum .
But 't is now high time to look about me for a decent Execution against next Sessions .
I hate a lazy Rogue , by whom one can get nothing 'till he is hang'd .
A Register of the Gang , [ Reading . ]
Crook-finger'd Jack .
A Year and a half in the Service  Let me see how much the Stock owes to his industry  one , two , three , four , five Gold Watches , and seven Silver ones .
A mighty clean-handed Fellow !
Sixteen Snuff-boxes , five of them of true Gold .
Six Dozen of Handkerchiefs , four silver-hilted Swords , half a Dozen of Shirts , three Tye-Periwigs , and a Piece of Broad-Cloth .
Considering these are only the Fruits of his leisure Hours , I do n't know a prettier Fellow , for no Man alive hath a more engaging Presence of Mind upon the Road .
Wat Dreary , alias Brown Will , an irregular Dog , who hath an underhand way of disposing of his Goods .
I 'll try him only for a Sessions or two longer upon his Good-behaviour .
Harry Paddington , a poor petty-larceny Rascal , without the least Genius  that Fellow , though he were to live these six Months , will never come to the Gallows with any Credit .
Slippery Sam  he goes off the next Sessions , for the Villain hath the Impudence to have Views of following his Trade as a Tailor , which he calls an honest Employment .
Mat of the Mint  listed not above a Month ago , a promising sturdy Fellow , and diligent in his way  somewhat too bold and hasty , and may raise good Contributions on the Public , if he does not cut himself short by Murder .
Tom Tipple , a guzzling soaking Sot , who is always too drunk to stand himself , or to make others stand .
A Cart is absolutely necessary for him .
Robin of Bagshot , alias Gorgon , alias Bluff Bob , alias Carbuncle , alias Bob Booty .


Enter Mrs. Peachum .


Mrs. Peachum .
What of Bob Booty , Husband ?
I hope nothing bad hath betided him .
You know , my Dear , he 's a favourite Customer of mine .
'T was he made me a present of this Ring .


Peachum .
I have set his Name down in the Black List , that 's all , my Dear  he spends his Life among Women , and as soon as his Money is gone , one or other of the Ladies will hang him for the Reward , and there 's forty Pound lost to us for-ever .


Mrs. Peachum .
You know , my Dear , I never meddle in matters of Death  I always leave those Affairs to you .
Women indeed are bitter bad Judges in these cases , for they are so partial to the Brave that they think every Man handsome who is going to the Camp or the Gallows .


AIR III .
Cold and raw , c..


[ Music ]


If any Wench Venus 's Girdle wear , Though she be never so ugly  Lilies and Roses will quickly appear , And her Face look wond ` rous smugly .
Beneath the left Ear so fit but a Cord , ( A Rope so charming a Zone is ! )
The Youth in his Cart hath the Air of a Lord , And we cry , There dies an Adonis !


But really , Husband , you should not be too hard-hearted , for you never had a finer , braver set of Men than at present .
We have not had a Murder among them all , these seven Months .
And truly , my Dear , that is a great Blessing .


Peachum .
What a dickens is the Woman always a whimpring about Murder for ?
No Gentleman is ever look'd upon the worse for killing a Man in his own Defence  and if Business can not be carried on without it , what would you have a Gentleman do ?


Mrs. Peachum .
If I am in the wrong , my Dear , you must excuse me , for no body can help the Frailty of an over-scrupulous Conscience .


Peachum .
Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man can be guilty of .
How many fine Gentlemen have we in Newgate every Year , purely upon that Article !
If they have wherewithal to persuade the Jury to bring it in Manslaughter , what are they the worse for it ?
So , my Dear , have done upon this Subject .
Was Captain Macheath here this Morning , for the Bank-Notes he left with you last Week ?


Mrs. Peachum .
Yes , my Dear  and though the Bank hath stopt Payment , he was so chearful and so agreeable !
Sure there is not a finer Gentleman upon the Road than the Captain !
if he comes from Bagshot at any reasonable Hour , he hath promis'd to make one this Evening with Polly and me , and Bob Booty at a Party of Quadrille .
Pray , my Dear , is the Captain rich ?


Peachum .
The Captain keeps too good Company ever to grow rich .
Marybone and the Chocolate-houses are his Undoing .
The Man that proposes to get Money by play should have the Education of a fine Gentleman , and be train'd up to it from his Youth .


Mrs. Peachum .
Really , I am sorry upon Polly 's Account the Captain hath not more Discretion .
What Business hath he to keep Company with Lords and Gentlemen ?
he should leave them to prey upon one another .


Peachum .
Upon Polly 's Account !
What , a Plague , does the Woman mean ?
-- Upon Polly 's Account !


Mrs. Peachum .
Captain Macheath is very fond of the Girl .


Peachum .
And what then ?


Mrs. Peachum .
If I have any Skill in the Ways of Women , I am sure Polly thinks him a very pretty Man .


Peachum .
And what then ?
You would not be so mad to have the Wench marry him !
Gamesters and Highwaymen are generally very good to their Whores , but they are very Devils to their Wives .


Mrs. Peachum .
But if Polly should be in Love , how should we help her , or how can she help herself ?
Poor Girl , I am in the utmost Concern about her .


AIR IV .
Why is your faithful Slave disdain'd ?
c..


[ Music ]


If Love the Virgin 's Heart invade , How , like a Moth , the simple Maid Still plays about the Flame !
If soon she be not made a Wife , Her Honour 's sing'd , and then for Life , She 's -- what I dare not name .


Peachum .
Look ye , Wife .
A handsome Wench in our way of Business is as profitable as at the Bar of a Temple Coffee-House , who looks upon it as her livelihood to grant every Liberty but one .
You see I would indulge the Girl as far as prudently we can .
In any thing , but Marriage !
After that , my Dear , how shall we be safe ?
Are we not then in her Husband 's Power ?
For a Husband hath the absolute Power over all a Wife 's Secrets but her own .
If the Girl had the Discretion of a Court-Lady , who can have a Dozen young Fellows at her Ear without complying with one , I should not matter it  but Polly is Tinder , and a Spark will at once set her on a Flame .
Married !
If the Wench does not know her own Profit , sure she knows her own Pleasure better than to make herself a Property !
My Daughter to me should be , like a Court-Lady to a Minister of State , a Key to the whole Gang .
Married !
If the Affair is not already done , I 'll terrify her from it , by the Example of our Neighbours .


Mrs. Peachum .
May-hap , my Dear , you may injure the Girl .
She loves to imitate the fine Ladies , and she may only allow the Captain Liberties in the view of Interest .


Peachum .
But 't is your Duty , my Dear , to warn the Girl against her Ruin , and to instruct her how to make the most of her Beauty .
I 'll go to her this moment , and sift her .
In the meantime , Wife , rip out the Coronets and Marks of these Dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs , for I can dispose of them this Afternoon to a Chap in the City .


[ Exit Peachum .


Mrs. Peachum .
Never was a Man more out of the way in an Argument than my Husband !
Why must our Polly , forsooth , differ from her Sex , and love only her Husband ?
And why must Polly 's Marriage , contrary to all Observations , make her the less followed by other Men ?
All Men are Thieves in Love , and like a Woman the better for being another 's Property .


AIR V. Of all the simple Things we do , c..


[ Music ]


A Maid is like the Golden Ore , Which hath Guineas intrinsical i n't , Whose Worth is never known before It is try'd and imprest in the Mint .
A Wife 's like a Guinea in Gold , Stampt with the Name of her Spouse  Now here , now there  is bought , or is sold  And is current in every House .


Enter Filch .


Mrs. Peachum .
Come hither , Filch .
I am as fond of this Child , as though my Mind misgave me he were my own .
He hath as fine a Hand at picking a Pocket as a Woman , and is as nimble-finger'd as a Juggler .
If an unlucky Session does not cut the Rope of thy Life , I pronounce , Boy , thou wilt be a great Man in History .
Where was your Post last Night , my Boy ?


Filch .
I ply'd at the Opera , Madam  and considering 't was neither dark nor rainy , so that there was no great Hurry in getting Chairs and Coaches , made a tolerable Hand o n't .
These seven Handkerchiefs , Madam .


Mrs. Peachum .
Colour'd ones , I see .
They are of sure Sale from our Warehouse at Redriff among the Seamen .


Filch .
And this Snuff-box .


Mrs. Peachum .
Set in Gold !
A pretty Encouragement this to a young Beginner .


Filch .
I had a fair Tug at a charming Gold Watch .
Pox take the Tailors for making the Fobs so deep and narrow !
It stuck by the way , and I was forc'd to make my Escape under a Coach .
Really , Madam , I fear I shall be cut off in the Flower of my Youth , so that every now and then ( since I was pumpt ) I have Thoughts of taking up and going to Sea .


Mrs. Peachum .
You should go to Hockley in the Hole , and to Marybone , Child , to learn Valour .
These are the Schools that have bred so many brave Men .
I thought , Boy , by this time , thou hadst lost Fear as well as Shame .
Poor Lad !
how little does he know as yet of the Old Baily !
For the first Fact I 'll insure thee from being hang'd  and going to Sea , Filch , will come time enough upon a Sentence of Transportation .
But now , since you have nothing better to do , ev'n go to your Book , and learn your Catechism  for really a Man makes but an ill Figure in the Ordinary 's Paper , who can not give a satisfactory Answer to his Questions .
But , hark you , my Lad .
Do n't tell me a Lye  for you know I hate a Liar .
Do you know of anything that hath pass'd between Captain Macheath and our Polly ?


Filch .
I beg you , Madam , do n't ask me  for I must either tell a Lye to you or to Miss Polly  for I promis'd her I would not tell .


Mrs. Peachum .
But when the Honour of our Family is concern'd --


Filch .
I shall lead a sad Life with Miss Polly , if ever she comes to know that I told you .
Besides , I would not willingly forfeit my own Honour by betraying any body .


Mrs. Peachum .
Yonder comes my Husband and Polly .
Come , Filch , you shall go with me into my own Room , and tell me the whole Story .
I 'll give thee a Glass of a most delicious Cordial that I keep for my own drinking .


[ Exeunt .


Enter Peachum , Polly .


Polly .
I know as well as any of the fine Ladies how to make the most of myself and of my Man too .
A Woman knows how to be mercenary , though she hath never been in a Court or at an Assembly .
We have it in our Natures , Papa .
If I allow Captain Macheath some trifling Liberties , I have this Watch and other visible Marks of his Favour to shew for it .
A Girl who can not grant some Things , and refuse what is most material , will make but a poor hand of her Beauty , and soon be thrown upon the Common .


AIR VI .
What shall I do to shew how much I love her , c..


[ Music ]


Virgins are like the fair Flower in its Lustre , Which in the Garden enamels the Ground  Near it the Bees in play flutter and cluster , And gaudy Butterflies frolick around .
But , when once pluck'd , 't is no longer alluring , To Covent-Garden 't is sent ( as yet sweet ) , There fades , and shrinks , and grows past all enduring , Rots , stinks , and dies , and is trod under feet .


Peachum .
You know , Polly , I am not against your toying and trifling with a Customer in the way of Business , or to get out a Secret , or so .
But if I find out that you have play'd the Fool and are married , you Jade you , I 'll cut your Throat , Hussy .
Now you know my Mind .


Enter Mrs. Peachum , in a very great Passion .


AIR VII .
Oh London is a fine Town .


[ Music ]


Our Polly is a sad Slut !
nor heeds what we have taught her .
I wonder any Man alive will ever rear a Daughter !
For she must have both Hoods and Gowns , and Hoops to swell her Pride , With Scarfs and Stays , and Gloves and Lace  and she will have Men beside  And when she 's drest with Care and Cost , all tempting , fine and gay , As Men should serve a Cucumber , she flings herself away .
Our Polly is a sad Slut !
c..


You Baggage !
you Hussy !
you inconsiderate Jade !
had you been hang'd , it would not have vex'd me , for that might have been your Misfortune  but to do such a mad thing by Choice  The Wench is married , Husband .


Peachum .
Married !
the Captain is a bold Man , and will risk any thing for Money  to be sure he believes her a Fortune .
Do you think your Mother and I should have liv'd comfortably so long together , if ever we had been married ?
Baggage !


Mrs. Peachum .
I knew she was always a proud Slut  and now the Wench hath play'd the Fool and Married , because forsooth she would do like the Gentry .
Can you support the Expence of a Husband , Hussy , in Gaming , Drinking and Whoring ?
Have you Money enough to carry on the daily Quarrels of Man and Wife about who shall squander most ?
There are not many Husbands and Wives , who can bear the Charges of plaguing one another in a handsom way .
If you must be married , could you introduce no body into our Family but a Highwayman ?
Why , thou foolish Jade , thou wilt be as ill-us'd , and as much neglected , as if thou hadst married a Lord !


Peachum .
Let not your Anger , my Dear , break through the Rules of Decency , for the Captain looks upon himself in the Military Capacity , as a Gentleman by his Profession .
Besides what he hath already , I know he is in a fair way of getting , or of dying  and both these ways , let me tell you , are most excellent Chances for a Wife .
Tell me , Hussy , are you ruin'd or no ?


Mrs. Peachum .
With Polly 's Fortune , she might very well have gone off to a Person of Distinction .
Yes , that you might , you pouting Slut !


Peachum .
What is the Wench dumb ?
Speak , or I 'll make you plead by squeezing out an Answer from you .
Are you really bound Wife to him , or are you only upon liking ?
[ Pinches her .


Polly .
Oh !
[ Screaming .


Mrs. Peachum .
How the Mother is to be pitied who hath handsom Daughters !
Locks , Bolts , Bars , and Lectures of Morality are nothing to them : They break through them all .
They have as much Pleasure in cheating a Father and Mother , as in cheating at Cards .


Peachum .
Why , Polly , I shall soon know if you are married , by Macheath 's keeping from our House .


AIR VIII .
Grim King of the Ghosts , c..


[ Music ]


Polly .
Can Love be control'd by Advice ?
Will Cupid our Mothers obey ?
Though my Heart were as frozen as Ice , At his Flame 'twould have melted away .
When he kist me so closely he prest , 'T was so sweet that I must have comply'd : So I thought it both safest and best To marry , for fear you should chide .


Mrs. Peachum .
Then all the Hopes of our Family are gone for ever and ever !


Peachum .
And Macheath may hang his Father and Mother-in-law , in hope to get into their Daughter 's Fortune .


Polly .
I did not marry him ( as 't is the Fashion ) coolly and deliberately for Honour or Money .
But , I love him .


Mrs. Peachum .
Love him !
worse and worse !
I thought the Girl had been better bred .
Oh Husband , Husband !
her Folly makes me mad !
my Head swims !
I 'm distracted !
I ca n't support myself -- Oh !
[ Faints .


Peachum .
See , Wench , to what a Condition you have reduc'd your poor Mother !
a Glass of Cordial , this instant .
How the poor Woman takes it to heart !


[ Polly goes out , and returns with it .


Ah , Hussy , now this is the only Comfort your Mother has left !


Polly .
Give her another Glass , Sir !
my Mama drinks double the Quantity whenever she is out of Order .
This , you see , fetches her .


Mrs. Peachum .
The Girl shews such a Readiness , and so much Concern , that I could almost find in my Heart to forgive her .


AIR IX .
O Jenny , O Jenny , where hast thou been .


[ Music ]


O Polly , you might have toy'd and kist .
By keeping Men off , you keep them on .


Polly .
But he so teaz'd me , And he so pleas'd me , What I did , you must have done .


Mrs. Peachum .
Not with a Highwayman .
-- You sorry Slut !


Peachum .
A Word with you , Wife .
'T is no new thing for a Wench to take Man without Consent of Parents .
You know 't is the Frailty of Women , my Dear .


Mrs. Peachum .
Yes , indeed , the Sex is frail .
But the first time a Woman is frail , she should be somewhat nice methinks , for then or never is the time to make her Fortune .
After that , she hath nothing to do but to guard herself from being found out , and she may do what she pleases .


Peachum .
Make yourself a little easy  I have a Thought shall soon set all Matters again to rights .
Why so melancholy , Polly ?
since what is done can not be undone , we must all endeavour to make the best of it .


Mrs. Peachum .
Well , Polly  as far as one Woman can forgive another , I forgive thee .
-- Your Father is too fond of you , Hussy .


Polly .
Then all my Sorrows are at an end .


Mrs. Peachum .
A mighty likely Speech in troth , for a Wench who is just married !


AIR X. Thomas , I can not , c..


[ Music ]


Polly .
I , like a Ship in Storms , was tost  Yet afraid to put in to Land : For seiz'd in the Port the Vessel 's lost , Whose Treasure is contreband .
The Waves are laid , My Duty 's paid .
O Joy beyond Expression !
Thus , safe a-shore , I ask no more , My All is in my Possession .


Peachum .
I hear Customers in t ` other Room : Go , talk with 'em , Polly  but come to us again , as soon as they are gone .
-- But , hark ye , Child , if 't is the Gentleman who was here Yesterday about the Repeating Watch  say , you believe we ca n't get Intelligence of it 'till to-morrow .
For I lent it to Suky Straddle , to make a figure with it to-night at a Tavern in Drury-Lane .
If t ` other Gentleman calls for the Silver-hilted Sword  you know Beetle-brow'd Jemmy hath it on , and he doth not come from Tunbridge 'till Tuesday Night  so that it can not be had 'till then .


[ Exit Polly .


Peachum .
Dear Wife , be a little pacified , Do n't let your Passion run away with your Senses .
Polly , I grant you , hath done a rash thing .


Mrs. Peachum .
If she had only an Intrigue with the Fellow , why the very best Families have excus'd and huddled up a Frailty of that sort .
'T is Marriage , Husband , that makes it a Blemish .


Peachum .
But Money , Wife , is the true Fuller 's Earth for Reputations , there is not a Spot or a Stain but what it can take out .
A rich Rogue now-a-days is fit Company for any Gentleman  and the World , my Dear , hath not such a Contempt for Roguery as you imagine .
I tell you , Wife , I can make this Match turn to our Advantage .


Mrs. Peachum .
I am very sensible , Husband , that Captain Macheath is worth Money , but I am in doubt whether he hath not two or three Wives already , and then if he should die in a Session or two , Polly 's Dower would come into Dispute .


Peachum .
That , indeed , is a Point which ought to be consider'd .


AIR XI .
A Soldier and a Sailor .


[ Music ]


A Fox may steal your Hens , Sir , A Whore your Health and Pence , Sir , Your Daughter rob your Chest , Sir , Your Wife may steal your Rest , Sir .
A Thief your Goods and Plate .
But this is all but picking , With Rest , Pence , Chest and Chicken  It ever was decreed , Sir , If Lawyer 's Hand is fee'd , Sir , He steals your whole Estate .


The Lawyers are bitter Enemies to those in our Way .
They do n't care that any body should get a clandestine Livelihood but themselves .


Enter Polly .


Polly .
'T was only Nimming Ned .
He brought in a Damask Window-Curtain , a Hoop-Petticoat , a pair of Silver Candlesticks , a Periwig , and one Silk Stocking , from the Fire that happen'd last Night .


Peachum .
There is not a Fellow that is cleverer in his way , and saves more Goods out of the Fire than Ned .
But now , Polly , to your Affair  for Matters must not be left as they are .
You are married then , it seems ?


Polly .
Yes , Sir .


Peachum .
And how do you propose to live , Child ?


Polly .
Like other Women , Sir , upon the Industry of my Husband .


Mrs. Peachum .
What , is the Wench turn'd Fool ?
A Highwayman 's Wife , like a Soldier 's , hath as little of his Pay , as of his Company .


Peachum .
And had not you the common Views of a Gentlewoman in your Marriage , Polly ?


Polly .
I do n't know what you mean , Sir .


Peachum .
Of a Jointure , and of being a Widow .


Polly .
But I love him , Sir  how then could I have Thoughts of parting with him ?


Peachum .
Parting with him !
Why , this is the whole Scheme and Intention of all Marriage-Articles .
The comfortable Estate of Widow-hood , is the only Hope that keeps up a Wife 's Spirits .
Where is the Woman who would scruple to be a Wife , if she had it in her Power to be a Widow , whenever she pleas'd ?
If you have any Views of this sort , Polly , I shall think the Match not so very unreasonable .


Polly .
How I dread to hear your Advice !
Yet I must beg you to explain yourself .


Peachum .
Secure what he hath got , have him peach'd the next Sessions , and then at once you are made a rich Widow .


Polly .
What , murder the Man I love !
The Blood runs cold at my Heart with the very thought of it .


Peachum .
Fie , Polly !
What hath Murder to do in the Affair ?
Since the thing sooner or later must happen , I dare say , the Captain himself would like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a Stranger .
Why , Polly , the Captain knows , that as 't is his Employment to rob , so 't is ours to take Robbers  every Man in his Business .
So that there is no Malice in the Case .


Mrs. Peachum .
Ay , Husband , now you have nick'd the Matter .
To have him peach'd is the only thing could ever make me forgive her .


AIR XII .
Now ponder well , ye Parents dear .


[ Music ]


Polly .
O ponder well !
be not severe  So save a wretched Wife !
For on the Rope that hangs my Dear Depends poor Polly 's Life .


Mrs. Peachum .
But your Duty to your Parents , Hussy , obliges you to hang him .
What would many a Wife give for such an Opportunity !


Polly .
What is a Jointure , what is Widow-hood to me ?
I know my Heart .
I can not survive him .


AIR XIII .
Le printems rapelle aux armes .


[ Music ]


The Turtle thus with plaintive Crying , Her Lover dying , The Turtle thus with plaintive Crying , Laments her Dove .
Down she drops quite spent with Sighing .
Pair'd in Death , as pair'd in Love .


Thus , Sir , it will happen to your poor Polly .


Mrs. Peachum .
What , is the Fool in Love in earnest then ?
I hate thee for being particular : Why , Wench , thou art a Shame to thy very Sex .


Polly .
But hear me , Mother .
-- If you ever lov'd --


Mrs. Peachum .
Those cursed Play-Books she reads have been her Ruin .
One Word more , Hussy , and I shall knock your Brains out , if you have any .


Peachum .
Keep out of the way , Polly , for fear of Mischief , and consider of what is proposed to you .


Mrs. Peachum .
Away , Hussy .
Hang your Husband , and be dutiful .


[ Exit Polly .


Re-enter Polly , and listens behind column .


Mrs. Peachum .
The Thing , Husband , must and shall be done .
For the sake of Intelligence we must take other measures , and have him peached the next Session without her Consent .
If she will not know her Duty , we know ours .


Peachum .
But really , my Dear , it grieves one 's Heart to take off a great Man .
When I consider his Personal Bravery , his fine Stratagem , how much we have already got by him , and how much more we may get , methinks I ca n't find in my Heart to have a hand in his Death .
I wish you could have made Polly undertake it .


Mrs. Peachum .
But in a Case of Necessity -- our own Lives are in danger .


Peachum .
Then , indeed , we must comply with the Customs of the World , and make Gratitude give way to Interest .
-- He shall be taken off .


Mrs. Peachum .
I 'll undertake to manage Polly .


Peachum .
And I 'll prepare Matters for the Old-Baily .


[ Exeunt severally .


Polly .
Now I 'm a Wretch , indeed .
-- Methinks I see him already in the Cart , sweeter and more lovely than the Nosegay in his Hand !
-- I hear the Crowd extolling his Resolution and Intrepidity !
-- What Vollies of Sighs are sent from the Windows of Holborn , that so comely a Youth should be brought to Disgrace !
-- I see him at the Tree !
The whole Circle are in Tears !
-- even Butchers weep !
-- Jack Ketch himself hesitates to perform his Duty , and would be glad to lose his Fee , by a Reprieve .
What then will become of Polly !
-- As yet I may inform him of their Design , and aid him in his Escape .
-- It shall be so -- But then he flies , absents himself , and I bar myself from his dear dear Conversation !
That too will distract me .
-- If he keep out of the way , my Papa and Mama may in time relent , and we may be happy .
-- If he stays , he is hang'd , and then he is lost for ever !
-- He intended to lie conceal'd in my Room , 'till the Dusk of the Evening : If they are abroad I 'll this Instant let him out , lest some Accident should prevent him .


[ Exit , and returns with Macheath .


Macheath .


AIR XIV .
Pretty Parrot , say --


[ Music ]


Macheath .
Pretty Polly , say , When I was away , Did your fancy never stray To some newer Lover ?


Polly .
Without Disguise , Heaving Sighs , Doting Eyes , My constant Heart discover .
Fondly let me loll !


Macheath .
O pretty , pretty Poll .


Polly .
And are you as fond as ever , my Dear ?


Macheath .
Suspect my Honour , my Courage , suspect any thing but my Love .
-- May my Pistols miss Fire , and my Mare slip her Shoulder while I am pursu'd , if I ever forsake thee !


Polly .
Nay , my Dear , I have no Reason to doubt you , for I find in the Romance you lent me , none of the great Heroes were ever false in Love .


AIR XV .
Pray , Fair one , be kind --


[ Music ]


Macheath .
My Heart was so free , It rov'd like the Bee , 'Till Polly my Passion requited  I sipt each Flower , I chang'd every Hour , But here every Flower is united .


Polly .
Were you sentenc'd to Transportation , sure , my Dear , you could not leave me behind you -- could you ?


Macheath .
Is there any Power , any Force that could tear me from thee ?
You might sooner tear a Pension out of the Hands of a Courtier , a Fee from a Lawyer , a pretty Woman from a Looking-glass , or any Woman from Quadrille .
-- But to tear me from thee is impossible !


AIR XVI .
Over the Hills and far away .


[ Music ]


Were I laid on Greenland 's Coast , And in my Arms embrac'd my Lass  Warm amidst eternal Frost , Too soon the Half Year 's Night would pass .


Polly .
Were I sold on Indian Soil , Soon as the burning Day was clos'd , I could mock the sultry Toil When on my Charmer 's Breast repos'd .


Macheath .
And I would love you all the Day ,


Polly .
Every Night would kiss and play ,


Macheath .
If with me you 'd fondly stray


Polly .
Over the Hills and far away .


Polly .
Yes , I would go with thee .
But oh !
-- how shall I speak it ?
I must be torn from thee .
We must part .


Macheath .
How !
Part !


Polly .
We must , we must .
-- My Papa and Mama are set against thy Life .
They now , even now are in Search after thee .
They are preparing Evidence against thee .
Thy Life depends upon a moment .


AIR XVII .
Gin thou wert mine awn thing --


[ Music ]


Oh what Pain it is to part !
Can I leave thee , can I leave thee ?
O what pain it is to part !
Can thy Polly ever leave thee ?
But lest Death my Love should thwart , And bring thee to the fatal Cart , Thus I tear thee from my bleeding Heart !
Fly hence , and let me leave thee .


One Kiss and then -- one Kiss -- be gone -- farewel .


Macheath .
My Hand , my Heart , my Dear , is so riveted to thine , that I can not unloose my Hold .


Polly .
But my Papa may intercept thee , and then I should lose the very glimmering of Hope .
A few Weeks , perhaps , may reconcile us all .
Shall thy Polly hear from thee ?


Macheath .
Must I then go ?


Polly .
And will not Absence change your Love ?


Macheath .
If you doubt it , let me stay -- and be hang'd .


Polly .
O how I fear !
how I tremble !
-- Go -- but when Safety will give you leave , you will be sure to see me again  for 'till then Polly is wretched .


AIR XVIII .
O the Broom , c..


[ Music ]


Macheath .
The Miser thus a Shilling sees , Which he 's oblig'd to pay , With sighs resigns it by degrees , And fears 't is gone for ay .


[ Parting , and looking back at each other with fondness  he at one Door , she at the other .


Polly .
The Boy , thus , when his Sparrow 's flown , The Bird in Silence eyes  But soon as out of Sight 't is gone , Whines , whimpers , sobs and cries .

ACT II .
SCENE I .


A TAVERN near Newgate .


Jemmy Twitcher , Crook-finger'd Jack , Wat Dreary , Robin of Bagshot , Nimming Ned , Henry Paddington , Matt of the Mint , Ben Budge , and the rest of the Gang , at the Table , with Wine , Brandy and Tobacco .


Ben .
But pr ` ythee , Matt , what is become of thy Brother Tom ?
I have not seen him since my Return from Transportation .


Matt .
Poor Brother Tom had an Accident this time Twelve-month , and so clever a made fellow he was , that I could not save him from those fleaing Rascals the Surgeons  and now , poor Man , he is among the Otamys at Surgeons Hall .


Ben .
So it seems , his Time was come .


Jemmy .
But the present Time is ours , and no body alive hath more .
Why are the Laws levell'd at us ?
are we more dishonest than the rest of Mankind ?
What we win , Gentlemen , is our own by the Law of Arms , and the Right of Conquest .


Crook .
Where shall we find such another Set of Practical Philosophers , who to a Man are above the Fear of Death ?


Wat .
Sound Men , and true !


Robin .
Of try'd Courage , and indefatigable Industry !


Ned .
Who is there here that would not die for his Friend ?


Harry .
Who is there here that would betray him for his Interest ?


Matt .
Shew me a Gang of Courtiers that can say as much .


Ben .
We are for a just Partition of the World , for every Man hath a Right to enjoy Life .


Matt .
We retrench the Superfluities of Mankind .
The World is avaritious , and I hate Avarice .
A covetous fellow , like a Jackdaw , steals what he was never made to enjoy , for the sake of hiding it .
These are the Robbers of Mankind , for Money was made for the Free-hearted and Generous , and where is the Injury of taking from another , what he hath not the Heart to make use of ?


Jemmy .
Our several Stations for the Day are fixt .
Good luck attend us all .
Fill the Glasses .


AIR XIX .
Fill every Glass , c..


[ Music ]


Matt .
Fill every Glass , for Wine inspires us , And fires us With Courage , Love and Joy .
Women and Wine should life employ .
Is there ought else on Earth desirous ?


Chorus .
Fill every Glass , c..


To them enter Macheath .


Macheath .
Gentlemen , well met .
My Heart hath been with you this Hour  but an unexpected Affair hath detain'd me .
No Ceremony , I beg you .


Matt .
We were just breaking up to go upon Duty .
Am I to have the Honour of taking the Air with you , Sir , this Evening upon the Heath ?
I drink a Dram now and then with the Stagecoachmen in the way of Friendship and Intelligence  and I know that about this Time there will be Passengers upon the Western Road , who are worth speaking with .


Macheath .
I was to have been of that Party -- but --


Matt .
But what , Sir ?


Macheath .
Is there any Man who suspects my Courage ?


Matt .
We have all been Witnesses of it .


Macheath .
My Honour and Truth to the Gang ?


Matt .
I 'll be answerable for it .


Macheath .
In the Division of our Booty , have I ever shewn the least Marks of Avarice or Injustice ?


Matt .
By these Questions something seems to have ruffled you .
Are any of us suspected ?


Macheath .
I have a fixed Confidence , Gentlemen , in you all , as Men of Honour , and as such I value and respect you .
Peachum is a Man that is useful to us .


Matt .
Is he about to play us any foul Play ?
I 'll shoot him through the Head .


Macheath .
I beg you , Gentlemen , act with Conduct and Discretion .
A Pistol is your last Resort .


Matt .
He knows nothing of this Meeting .


Macheath .
Business can not go on without him .
He is a Man who knows the World , and is a necessary Agent to us .
We have had a slight Difference , and 'till it is accommodated I shall be oblig'd to keep out of his way .
Any private Dispute of mine shall be of no ill consequence to my Friends .
You must continue to act under his Direction , for the moment we break loose from him , our Gang is ruin'd .


Matt .
As a Bawd to a Whore , I grant you , he is to us of great Convenience .


Macheath .
Make him believe I have quitted the Gang , which I can never do but with Life .
At our private Quarters I will continue to meet you .
A Week or so will probably reconcile us .


Matt .
Your Instructions shall be observ'd .
'T is now high time for us to repair to our several Duties  so 'till the Evening at our Quarters in Moor-Fields we bid you farewel .


Macheath .
I shall wish myself with you .
Success attend you .


[ Sits down melancholy at the Table .


AIR XX .
March in Rinaldo , with Drums and Trumpets .


[ Music ]


Matt .
Let us take the Road .
Hark !
I hear the Sound of Coaches !
The Hour of Attack approaches , To your Arms , brave Boys , and load .
See the Ball I hold !
Let the Chymists toil like Asses , Our Fire their Fire surpasses , And turns all our Lead to Gold .


[ The Gang , rang'd in the Front of the Stage , load their Pistols , and stick them under their Girdles  then go off singing the first Part in Chorus .


Macheath .
What a Fool is a fond Wench !
Polly is most confoundedly bit .
-- I love the Sex .
And a Man who loves Money , might as well be contented with one Guinea , as I with one Woman .
The Town perhaps have been as much obliged to me , for recruiting it with free-hearted Ladies , as to any Recruiting Officer in the Army .
If it were not for us , and the other Gentlemen of the Sword , Drury-Lane would be uninhabited .


AIR XXI .
Would you have a young Virgin , c..


[ Music ]


If the Heart of a Man is deprest with Cares , The Mist is dispell'd when a Woman appears  Like the Notes of a Fiddle , she sweetly , sweetly Raises the Spirits , and charms our Ears , Roses and Lilies her Cheeks disclose , But her ripe Lips are more sweet than those .
Press her , Caress her , With Blisses , Her Kisses Dissolve us in Pleasure , and soft Repose .


I must have Women .
There is nothing unbends the Mind like them .
Money is not so strong a Cordial for the Time .
Drawer -- [ Enter Drawer . ]
Is the Porter gone for all the Ladies according to my Directions ?


Drawer .
I expect him back every Minute .
But you know , Sir , you sent him as far as Hockley in the Hole for three of the Ladies , for one in Vinegar-Yard , and for the rest of them somewhere about Lewkner 's - Lane .
Sure some of them are below , for I hear the Bar-Bell .
As they come I will shew them up .
Coming , Coming .


Enter Mrs. Coaxer , Dolly Trull , Mrs. Vixen , Betty Doxy , Jenny Diver , Mrs. Slammekin , Suky Tawdry , and Molly Brazen .


Macheath .
Dear Mrs. Coaxer , you are welcome .
You look charmingly to-day .
I hope you do n't want the Repairs of Quality , and lay on Paint .
-- Dolly Trull !
kiss me , you Slut  are you as amorous as ever , Hussy ?
You are always so taken up with stealing Hearts , that you do n't allow yourself Time to steal any thing else .
-- Ah Dolly , thou wilt ever be a Coquette !
Mrs. Vixen , I 'm yours , I always lov'd a Woman of Wit and Spirit  they make charming Mistresses , but plaguy Wives -- Betty Doxy !
Come hither , Hussy .
Do you drink as hard as ever ?
You had better stick to good wholesom Beer  for in troth , Betty , Strong-Waters will in time ruin your Constitution .
You should leave those to your Betters .
-- What !
and my pretty Jenny Diver too !
As prim and demure as ever !
There is not any Prude , though ever so high bred , hath a more sanctify'd Look , with a more mischievous Heart .
Ah !
thou art a dear artful Hypocrite .
-- Mrs. Slammekin !
as careless and genteel as ever !
all you fine Ladies , who know your own Beauty , affect an Undress .
-- But see , here 's Suky Tawdry come to contradict what I was saying .
Every thing she gets one way she lays out upon her Back .
Why , Suky , you must keep at least a Dozen Tallymen .
Molly Brazen !
[ She kisses him . ]
That 's well done .
I love a free-hearted Wench .
Thou hast a most agreeable Assurance , Girl , and art as willing as a Turtle .
-- But hark !
I hear Music .
The Harper is at the Door .
If Music be the Food of Love , play on .
Ere you seat yourselves , Ladies , what think you of a Dance ?
Come in .
[ Enter Harper . ]
Play the French Tune , that Mrs. Slammekin was so fond of .


[ A Dance a la ronde in the French manner  near the end of it this song and Chorus .


AIR XXII .
Cotillon .


[ Music ]


Youth 's the Season made for Joys , Love is then our Duty , She alone who that employs , Well deserves her Beauty .
Let 's be gay , While we may , Beauty 's a Flower , despis'd in Decay .
Youth 's the Season , c..


Let us drink and sport to-day , Ours is not to-morrow .
Love with Youth flies swift away , Age is nought but Sorrow .
Dance and sing , Time 's on the Wing .
Life never knows the Return of Spring .


Chorus .
Let us drink , c..


Macheath .
Now , pray Ladies , take your Places .
Here Fellow .
[ Pays the Harper . ]
Bid the Drawer bring us more Wine .
[ Exit Harper . ]
If any of the Ladies choose Ginn , I hope they will be so free to call for it .


Jenny .
You look as if you meant me .
Wine is strong enough for me .
Indeed , Sir , I never drink Strong-Waters , but when I have the Cholic .


Macheath .
Just the Excuse of the fine Ladies !
Why , a Lady of Quality is never without the Cholic .
I hope , Mrs. Coaxer , you have had good Success of late in your Visits among the Mercers .


Mrs. Coaxer .
We have so many Interlopers -- Yet with Industry , one may still have a little Picking .
I carried a silver-flowered Lutestring , and a Piece of black Padesoy to Mr. Peachum 's Lock but last Week .


Mrs. Vixen .
There 's Molly Brazen hath the Ogle of a Rattle-Snake .
She rivetted a Linen-Draper 's Eye so fast upon her , that he was nick'd of three Pieces of Cambric before he could look off .


Brazen .
Oh dear Madam !
-- But sure nothing can come up to your handling of Laces !
And then you have such a sweet deluding Tongue !
To cheat a Man is nothing  but the Woman must have fine Parts indeed who cheats a Woman .


Mrs. Vixen .
Lace , Madam , lies in a small Compass , and is of easy Conveyance .
But you are apt , Madam , to think too well of your Friends .


Mrs. Coaxer .
If any woman hath more Art than another , to be sure , 't is Jenny Diver .
Though her Fellow be never so agreeable , she can pick his Pocket as coolly , as if money were her only Pleasure .
Now that is a Command of the Passions uncommon in a Woman !


Jenny .
I never go to the Tavern with a Man , but in the View of Business .
I have other Hours , and other sort of Men for my Pleasure .
But had I your Address , Madam --


Macheath .
Have done with your Compliments , Ladies  and drink about : You are not so fond of me , Jenny , as you use to be .


Jenny .
'T is not convenient , Sir , to shew my Fondness among so many Rivals .
'T is your own Choice , and not the Warmth of my Inclination that will determine you .


AIR XXIII .
All in a misty Morning , c..


[ Music ]


Before the Barn-Door crowing , The Cock by Hens attended , His Eyes around him throwing , Stands for a while suspended .


Then One he singles from the Crew , And cheers the happy Hen  With how do you do , and how do you do , And how do you do again .


Macheath .
Ah Jenny !
thou art a dear Slut .


Jenny .
A Man of Courage should never put any thing to the Risk but his Life .
These are the Tools of a Man of Honour .
Cards and Dice are only fit for cowardly Cheats , who prey upon their Friends .


[ She takes up his Pistol .
Tawdry takes up the other .


Tawdry .
This , Sir , is fitter for your Hand .
Besides your Loss of Money , 't is a Loss to the Ladies .
Gaming takes you off from Women .
How fond could I be of you !
but before Company 't is ill bred .


Macheath .
Wanton Hussies !


Jenny .
I must and will have a Kiss to give my Wine a Zest .


[ They take him about the Neck and make signs to Peachum and Constables , who rush in upon him .


Peachum .
I seize you , Sir , as my Prisoner .


Macheath .
Was this well done , Jenny ?
-- Women are Decoy Ducks  who can trust them !
Beasts , Jades , Jilts , Harpies , Furies , Whores !


Peachum .
Your Case , Mr. Macheath , is not particular .
The greatest Heroes have been ruin'd by Women .
But , to do them Justice , I must own they are a pretty sort of Creatures , if we could trust them .
You must now , Sir , take your Leave of the Ladies , and if they have a mind to make you a Visit , they will be sure to find you at home .
This Gentleman , Ladies , lodges in Newgate .
Constables , wait upon the Captain to his Lodgings .


AIR XXIV .
When first I laid Siege to my Chloris , c..


[ Music ]


Macheath .
At the Tree I shall suffer with Pleasure , At the Tree I shall suffer with Pleasure , Let me go where I will , In all kinds of Ill , I shall find no such Furies as these are .


Peachum .
Ladies , I 'll take care the Reckoning shall be discharged .


[ Exit Macheath , guarded with Peachum and Constables .


Mrs. Vixen .
Look ye , Mrs. Jenny , though Mr. Peachum may have made a private Bargain with you and Suky Tawdry for betraying the Captain , as we were all assisting , we ought all to share alike .


Mrs. Coaxer .
I think Mr. Peachum , after so long an Acquaintance , might have trusted me as well as Jenny Diver .


Mrs. Slammekin .
I am sure at least three Men of his hanging , and in a Year 's time too ( if he did me Justice ) should be set down to my Account .


Trull .
Mrs. Slammekin , that is not fair .
For you know one of them was taken in Bed with me .


Jenny .
As far as a Bowl of Punch or a Treat , I believe Mrs. Suky will join with me .
-- As for any thing else , Ladies , you can not in Conscience expect it .


Mrs. Slammekin .
Dear Madam --


Trull .
I would not for the World --


Mrs. Slammekin .
'T is impossible for me --


Trull .
As I hope to be sav'd , Madam --


Mrs. Slammekin .
Nay , then I must stay here all Night --


Trull .
Since you command me .


[ Exeunt with great Ceremony .

SCENE II .
Newgate .


Lockit , Turnkeys , Macheath , Constables .


Lockit .
Noble Captain , you are welcome .
You have not been a Lodger of mine this Year and half .
You know the Custom , Sir .
Garnish , Captain , Garnish .
Hand me down those Fetters there .


Macheath .
Those , Mr. Lockit , seem to be the heaviest of the whole Set .
With your Leave , I should like the further Pair better .


Lockit .
Look ye , Captain , we know what is fittest for our Prisoners .
When a Gentleman uses me with Civility , I always do the best I can to please him .
-- Hand them down I say .
-- We have them of all Prices , from one Guinea to ten , and 't is fitting every Gentleman should please himself .


Macheath .
I understand you , Sir .
[ Gives Money . ]
The Fees here are so many , and so exorbitant , that few Fortunes can bear the Expence of getting off handsomly , or of dying like a Gentleman .


Lockit .
Those , I see , will fit the Captain better -- Take down the further Pair .
Do but examine them , Sir .
-- Never was better work .
-- How genteely they are made !
-- They will fit as easy as a Glove , and the nicest Man in England might not be asham'd to wear them .
[ He puts on the Chains . ]
If I had the best Gentleman in the Land in my Custody I could not equip him more handsomly .
And so , Sir -- I now leave you to your private Meditations .


[ Exeunt leaving Macheath solus .


Macheath .


AIR XXV .
Courtiers , Courtiers , think it no Harm , c..


[ Music ]


Man may escape from Rope and Gun  Nay , some have out liv'd the Doctor 's Pill  Who takes a Woman must be undone , That Basilisk is sure to kill .
The Fly that sips Treacle is lost in the Sweets , So he that tastes Woman , Woman , Woman , He that tastes Woman , ruin meets .


To what a woful Plight have I brought myself !
Here must I ( all Day long , 'till I am hang'd ) be confin'd to hear the Reproaches of a Wench who lays her Ruin at my Door -- I am in the Custody of her Father , and to be sure , if he knows of the matter , I shall have a fine time o n't betwixt this and my Execution .
-- But I promis'd the Wench Marriage -- What signifies a Promise to a Woman ?
Does not Man in Marriage itself promise a hundred things that he never means to perform ?
Do all we can , Women will believe us  for they look upon a Promise as an Excuse for following their own Inclinations .
-- But here comes Lucy , and I can not get from her .
-- Wou'd I were deaf !


Enter Lucy .


Lucy .
You base Man you , -- how can you look me in the Face after what hath passed between us ?
-- See here , perfidious Wretch , how I am forc'd to bear about the Load of Infamy you have laid upon me -- O Macheath !
thou hast robb'd me of my Quiet -- to see thee tortur'd would give me Pleasure .


AIR XXVI .
A lovely Lass to a Friar came , c..


[ Music ]


Thus when a good Housewife sees a Rat In her Trap in the Morning taken , With Pleasure her Heart goes pit-a-pat , In Revenge for her Loss of Bacon .
Then she throws him To the Dog or Cat , To be worried , crush'd and shaken .


Macheath .
Have you no Bowels , no Tenderness , my dear Lucy , to see a Husband in these Circumstances ?


Lucy .
A Husband !


Macheath .
In ev'ry Respect but the Form , and that , my Dear , may be said over us at any time .
-- Friends should not insist upon Ceremonies .
From a Man of Honour , his Word is as good as his Bond .


Lucy .
'T is the Pleasure of all you fine Men to insult the Women you have ruin'd .


AIR XXVII .
'T was when the Sea was roaring , c..


[ Music ]


How cruel are the Traitors , Who lye and swear in jest , To cheat unguarded Creatures Of Virtue , Fame , and Rest !
Whoever steals a Shilling , Through Shame the Guilt conceals : In Love the perjur'd Villain With Boasts the Theft reveals .


Macheath .
The very first Opportunity , my Dear , ( have but Patience ) you shall be my Wife in whatever manner you please .


Lucy .
Insinuating Monster !
And so you think I know nothing of the Affair of Miss Polly Peachum .
-- I could tear thy Eyes out !


Macheath .
Sure , Lucy , you ca n't be such a Fool as to be jealous of Polly !


Lucy .
Are you not married to her , you Brute , you .


Macheath .
Married !
Very good .
The Wench gives it out only to vex thee , and to ruin me in thy good Opinion .
'T is true , I go to the House  I chat with the Girl , I kiss her , I say a thousand things to her ( as all Gentlemen do ) that mean nothing , to divert myself  and now the silly Jade hath set it about that I am married to her , to let me know what she would be at .
Indeed , my dear Lucy , these violent Passions may be of ill consequence to a Woman in your Condition .


Lucy .
Come , come , Captain , for all your Assurance , you know that Miss Polly hath put it out of your Power to do me the Justice you promis'd me .


Macheath .
A jealous Woman believes every thing her Passion suggests .
To convince you of my Sincerity , if we can find the Ordinary , I shall have no Scruples of making you my Wife  and I know the Consequence of having two at a time .


Lucy .
That you are only to be hang'd , and so get rid of them both .


Macheath .
I am ready , my dear Lucy , to give you Satisfaction -- if you think there is any in Marriage .
-- What can a Man of Honour say more ?


Lucy .
So then , it seems , you are not married to Miss Polly .


Macheath .
You know , Lucy , the Girl is prodigiously conceited .
No Man can say a civil thing to her , but ( like other fine Ladies ) her Vanity makes her think he 's her own for ever and ever .


AIR XXVIII .
The Sun had loos'd his weary Teams , c..


[ Music ]


The first time at the Looking-glass The Mother sets her Daughter , The Image strikes the smiling Lass With Self-love ever after , Each time she looks , she , fonder grown , Thinks ev'ry Charm grows stronger .
But alas , vain Maid , all Eyes but your own Can see you are not younger .


When Women consider their own Beauties , they are all alike unreasonable in their Demands  for they expect their Lovers should like them as long as they like themselves .


Lucy .
Yonder is my Father -- perhaps this way we may light upon the Ordinary , who shall try if you will be as good as your Word .
-- For I long to be made an honest Woman .


[ Exeunt .


Enter Peachum and Lockit with an Account-Book .


Lockit .
In this last Affair , Brother Peachum , we are agreed .
You have consented to go halves in Macheath .


Peachum .
We shall never fall out about an Execution -- But as to that Article , pray how stands our last Year 's Account ?


Lockit .
If you will run your Eye over it , you 'll find 't is fair and clearly stated .


Peachum .
This long Arrear of the Government is very hard upon us !
Can it be expected that we would hang our Acquaintance for nothing , when our Betters will hardly save theirs without being paid for it .
Unless the People in Employment pay better , I promise them for the future , I shall let other Rogues live besides their own .


Lockit .
Perhaps , Brother , they are afraid these Matters may be carried too far .
We are treated too by them with Contempt , as if our Profession were not reputable .


Peachum .
In one respect indeed our Employment may be reckon'd dishonest , because , like Great Statesmen , we encourage those who betray their Friends .


Lockit .
Such Language , Brother , any where else , might turn to your Prejudice .
Learn to be more guarded , I beg you .


AIR XXIX .
How happy are we , c..


[ Music ]


When you censure the Age , Be cautious and sage , Lest the Courtiers offended should be : If you mention Vice or Bribe , 'T is so pat to all the Tribe  Each cries -- That was levell'd at me .


Peachum .
Here 's poor Ned Clincher 's Name , I see .
Sure , Brother Lockit , there was a little unfair Proceeding in Ned 's Case : for he told me in the Condemn'd Hold , that for Value receiv'd , you had promis'd him a Session or two longer without Molestation .


Lockit .
Mr. Peachum -- this is the first time my Honour was ever call'd in Question .


Peachum .
Business is at an end -- if once we act dishonourably .


Lockit .
Who accuses me ?


Peachum .
You are warm , Brother .


Lockit .
He that attacks my Honour , attacks my Livelihood .
-- And this Usage -- Sir -- is not to be borne .


Peachum .
Since you provoke me to speak -- I must tell you too , that Mrs. Coaxer charges you with defrauding her of her Information-Money , for the apprehending of curl-pated Hugh .
Indeed , indeed , Brother , we must punctually pay our Spies , or we shall have no Information .


Lockit .
Is this Language to me , Sirrah , -- who have sav'd you from the Gallows , Sirrah !
[ Collaring each other .


Peachum .
If I am hang'd , it shall be for ridding the World of an arrant Rascal .


Lockit .
This Hand shall do the Office of the Halter you deserve , and throttle you -- you Dog !
--


Peachum .
Brother , Brother -- We are both in the Wrong -- We shall be both Losers in the Dispute -- for you know we have it in our Power to hang each other .
You should not be so passionate .


Lockit .
Nor you so provoking .


Peachum .
'T is our mutual Interest  't is for the Interest of the World we should agree .
If I said any thing , Brother , to the Prejudice of your Character , I ask pardon .


Lockit .
Brother Peachum -- I can forgive as well as resent .
-- Give me your Hand .
Suspicion does not become a Friend .


Peachum .
I only meant to give you Occasion to justify yourself : But I must now step home , for I expect the Gentleman about this Snuff-box , that Filch nimm'd two Nights ago in the Park .
I appointed him at this Hour .
[ Exit Peachum .


Enter Lucy .


Lockit .
Whence come you , Hussy ?


Lucy .
My Tears might answer that Question .


Lockit .
You have then been whimpering and fondling , like a Spaniel , over the Fellow that hath abus'd you .


Lucy .
One ca n't help Love  one ca n't cure it .
'T is not in my Power to obey you , and hate him .


Lockit .
Learn to bear your Husband 's Death like a reasonable Woman .
'T is not the fashion , now-a-days , so much as to affect Sorrow upon these Occasions .
No Woman would ever marry , if she had not the Chance of Mortality for a Release .
Act like a Woman of Spirit , Hussy , and thank your Father for what he is doing .

Such a Man can I think of quitting ?
When first we met , so moves me yet , O see how my Heart is splitting !

Lucy .
Though the Ordinary was out of the way to-day , I hope , my Dear , you will , upon the first Opportunity , quiet my Scruples -- Oh Sir !
-- my Father 's hard heart is not to be soften'd , and I am in the utmost Despair .


Macheath .
But if I could raise a small Sum -- Would not twenty Guineas , think you , move him ?
-- Of all the Arguments in the way of Business , the Perquisite is the most prevailing -- Your Father 's Perquisites for the Escape of Prisoners must amount to a considerable Sum in the Year .
Money well tim'd , and properly apply'd , will do any thing .

If you at an Office solicit your Due , And would not have Matters neglected  You must quicken the Clerk with the Perquisite too , To do what his Duty directed .

Lucy .
What Love or Money can do shall be done : for all my Comfort depends upon your Safety .

Polly .
Where is my dear Husband ?
-- Was a Rope ever intended for this Neck !
-- O let me throw my Arms about it , and throttle thee with Love !
-- Why dost thou turn away from me ?
'T is thy Polly -- 'T is thy Wife .


Macheath .
Was ever such an unfortunate Rascal as I am !


Lucy .
Was there ever such another Villain !


Polly .
O Macheath !
was it for this we parted ?
Taken !
Imprisoned !
Try'd !
Hang'd -- cruel Reflection !
I 'll stay with thee 'till Death -- no Force shall tear thy dear Wife from thee now .
-- What means my Love ?

Am I then bilk'd of my Virtue ?
Can I have no Reparation ?
Sure Men were born to lie , and Women to believe them !
O Villain !

Polly .
Am I not thy Wife ?
-- Thy Neglect of me , thy Aversion to me too severely proves it .
-- Look on me .
-- Tell me , am I not thy Wife ?


Lucy .
Perfidious Wretch !


Polly .
Barbarous Husband !


Lucy .
Hadst thou been hang'd five Months ago , I had been happy .


Polly .
And I too -- If you had been kind to me 'till Death , it would not have vexed me -- And that 's no very unreasonable Request , ( though from a Wife ) to a Man who hath not above seven or eight Days to live .


Lucy .
Art thou then married to another ?
Hast thou two Wives , Monster ?


Macheath .
If Women 's Tongues can cease for an Answer -- hear me .

Sure , my Dear , there ought to be some Preference shewn to a Wife !
At least she may claim the Appearance of it .
He must be distracted with his Misfortunes , or he could not use me thus .


Lucy .
O Villain , Villain !
thou hast deceiv'd me .

Not a Prude wishes more heartily to have Facts against her intimate Acquaintance , than I now wish to have Facts against thee .

Macheath .
Be pacified , my dear Lucy -- This is all a Fetch of Polly 's , to make me desperate with you in case I get off .
If I am hang'd , she would fain have the Credit of being thought my Widow -- Really , Polly , this is no time for a Dispute of this sort  for whenever you are talking of Marriage , I am thinking of Hanging .


Polly .
And hast thou the Heart to persist in disowning me ?


Macheath .
And hast thou the Heart to persist in persuading me that I am married ?
Why , Polly , dost thou seek to aggravate my Misfortunes ?


Lucy .
Really , Miss Peachum , you but expose yourself .
Besides , 't is barbarous in you to worry a Gentleman in his Circumstances .

Polly .
Decency , Madam , methinks might teach you to behave yourself with some Reserve with the Husband , while his Wife is present .


Macheath .
But seriously , Polly , this is carrying the Joke a little too far .


Lucy .
If you are determin'd , Madam , to raise a Disturbance in the Prison , I shall be obliged to send for the Turnkey to shew you the Door .
I am sorry , Madam , you force me to be so ill-bred .


Polly .

And my Duty , Madam , obliges me to stay with my Husband , Madam .

Polly .
Dear , dear Father , do not tear me from him -- I must speak  I have more to say to him -- Oh !
twist thy Fetters about me , that he may not haul me from thee !

Lucy , Macheath .


Macheath .
I am naturally compassionate , Wife  so that I could not use the Wench as she deserv'd  which made you at first suspect there was something in what she said .


Lucy .
Indeed , my Dear , I was strangely puzzled .


Macheath .
If that had been the Case , her Father would never have brought me into this Circumstance -- No , Lucy , -- I had rather die than be false to thee .


Lucy .
How happy am I , if you say this from your Heart !
For I love thee so , that I could sooner bear to see thee hang'd than in the Arms of another .


Macheath .
But could ` st thou bear to see me hang'd ?


Lucy .
O Macheath , I can never live to see that Day .


Macheath .
You see , Lucy  in the Account of Love you are in my Debt , and you must now be convinc'd , that I rather choose to die than be another 's .
-- Make me , if possible , love thee more , and let me owe my Life to thee -- If you refuse to assist me , Peachum and your Father will immediately put me beyond all means of Escape .


Lucy .
My Father , I know , hath been drinking hard with the Prisoners : and I fancy he is now taking his Nap in his own Room -- If I can procure the Keys , shall I go off with thee , my Dear ?


Macheath .
If we are together , ` twill be impossible to lie conceal'd .
As soon as the Search begins to be a little cool , I will send to thee -- 'Till then my Heart is thy Prisoner .


Lucy .
Come then , my dear Husband -- owe thy Life to me -- and though you love me not -- be grateful , -- but that Polly runs in my Head strangely .

Lockit , Lucy .


Lockit .
To be sure , Wench , you must have been aiding and abetting to help him to this Escape .


Lucy .
Sir , here hath been Peachum and his Daughter Polly , and to be sure they know the Ways of Newgate as well as if they had been born and bred in the Place all their Lives .
Why must all your Suspicion light upon me ?


Lockit .
Lucy , Lucy , I will have none of these shuffling Answers .


Lucy .
Well then -- If I know any thing of him I wish I may be burnt !


Lockit .
Keep your Temper , Lucy , or I shall pronounce you guilty .


Lucy .
Keep yours , Sir , -- I do wish I may be burnt .
I do -- And what can I say more to convince you ?


Lockit .
Did he tip handsomly ?
-- How much did he come down with ?
Come , Hussy , do n't cheat your Father  and I shall not be angry with you -- Perhaps , you have made a better Bargain with him than I could have done -- How much , my good Girl ?


Lucy .
You know , Sir , I am fond of him , and would have given Money to have kept him with me .


Lockit .
Ah Lucy !
thy Education might have put thee more upon thy Guard  for a Girl in the Bar of an Ale-house is always besieg'd .


Lucy .
Dear Sir , mention not my Education -- for 't was to that I owe my Ruin .


AIR XL .
If Love 's a sweet Passion , c..


[ Music ]


When young at the Bar you first taught me to score , And bid me be free of my Lips , and no more  I was kiss'd by the Parson , the Squire , and the Sot , When the Guest was departed , the Kiss was forgot .
But his Kiss was so sweet , and so closely he prest , That I languish'd and pin'd till I granted the rest .


If you can forgive me , Sir , I will make a fair Confession , for to be sure he hath been a most barbarous Villain to me .


Lockit .
And so you have let him escape , Hussy -- Have you ?


Lucy .
When a Woman loves  a kind Look , a tender Word can persuade her to any thing -- And I could ask no other Bribe .


Lockit .
Thou wilt always be a vulgar Slut , Lucy .
-- If you would not be look'd upon as a Fool , you should never do any thing but upon the foot of Interest .
Those that act otherwise are their own Bubbles .


Lucy .
But Love , Sir , is a Misfortune that may happen to the most discreet Women , and in Love we are all Fools alike -- Notwithstanding all he swore , I am now fully convinc'd that Polly Peachum is actually his Wife .
-- Did I let him escape , ( Fool that I was ! )
to go to her ?
-- Polly will wheedle herself into his Money , and then Peachum will hang him , and cheat us both .


Lockit .
So I am to be ruin'd , because , forsooth , you must be in Love !
-- a very pretty Excuse !


Lucy .
I could murder that impudent happy Strumpet : -- I gave him his Life , and that Creature enjoys the Sweets of it .
-- Ungrateful Macheath !

South-Sea Ballad .

My Love is all Madness and Folly , Alone I lie , Toss , tumble , and cry , What a happy Creature is Polly !
Was e'er such a Wretch as I !
With rage I redden like Scarlet , That my dear inconstant Varlet , Stark blind to my Charms , Is lost in the Arms Of that Jilt , that inveigling Harlot !
Stark blind to my Charms , Is lost in the Arms Of that Jilt , that inveigling Harlot !
This , this my Resentment alarms .


Lockit .
And so , after all this Mischief , I must stay here to be entertain'd with your Catterwauling , Mrs. Puss !
-- Out of my Sight , wanton Strumpet !
you shall fast and mortify yourself into Reason , with now and then a little handsom Discipline to bring you to your Senses .
-- Go .
[ Exit Lucy .


Peachum then intends to outwit me in this Affair  but I 'll be even with him .
-- The Dog is leaky in his Liquor , so I 'll ply him that way , get the Secret from him , and turn this Affair to my own Advantage .
-- Lions , Wolves , and Vultures do n't live together in Herds , Droves or Flocks .
-- Of all Animals of Prey , Man is the only sociable one .
Every one of us preys upon his Neighbour , and yet we herd together .
-- Peachum is my Companion , my Friend .
-- According to the Custom of the World , indeed , he may quote thousands of Precedents for cheating me -- And shall not I make use of the Privilege of Friendship to make him a Return .

Packington 's Pound .


[ Music ]


Thus Gamesters united in Friendship are found , Though they know that their Industry all is a Cheat  They flock to their Prey at the Dice-Box 's Sound , And join to promote one another 's Deceit .
But if by mishap They fail of a Chap , To keep in their Hands , they each other entrap .
Like Pikes , lank with Hunger , who miss of their Ends , They bite their Companions , and prey on their Friends .


Now , Peachum , you and I , like honest Tradesmen , are to have a fair Trial which of us two can over-reach the other .

I am sorry , Gentlemen , the Road was so barren of Money .

AIR XLIII .
Lillibullero .


[ Music ]


The Modes of the Court so common are grown , That a true Friend can hardly be met  Friendship for Interest is but a Loan , Which they let out for what they can get .
'T is true , you find Some Friends so kind , Who will give you good Counsel themselves to defend .
In sorrowful Ditty , They promise , they pity , But shift for your Money , from Friend to Friend .


But we , Gentlemen , have still Honour enough to break through the Corruptions of the World .
-- And while I can serve you , you may command me .


Ben .
It grieves my Heart that so generous a Man should be involv'd in such Difficulties , as oblige him to live with such ill Company , and herd with Gamesters .


Matt .
See the Partiality of Mankind !
-- One Man may steal a Horse , better than another look over a Hedge .
-- Of all Mechanics , of all servile Handicrafts-men , a Gamester is the vilest .
But yet , as many of the Quality are of the Profession , he is admitted amongst the politest Company .
I wonder we are not more respected .


Macheath .
There will be deep Play to-night at Mary-bone , and consequently Money may be pick'd up upon the Road .
Meet me there , and I 'll give you the Hint who is worth Setting .


Matt .
The Fellow with a brown Coat with a narrow Gold Binding , I am told , is never without Money .


Macheath .
What do you mean , Matt ?
-- Sure you will not think of meddling with him !
-- He 's a good honest kind of a Fellow , and one of us .


Ben .
To be sure , Sir , we will put ourselves under your Direction .


Macheath .
Have an Eye upon the Money-Lenders .
-- A Rouleau , or two , would prove a pretty sort of an Expedition .
I hate Extortion .


Matt .
Those Rouleaus are very pretty Things .
-- I hate your Bank Bills .
-- There is such a Hazard in putting them off .


Macheath .
There is a certain Man of Distinction , who in his Time hath nick'd me out of a great deal of the Ready .
He is in my Cash , Ben  -- I 'll point him out to you this Evening , and you shall draw upon him for the Debt .
-- The Company are met  I hear the Dice-Box in the other Room .
So , Gentlemen , your Servant .
You 'll meet me at Mary-bone .

Peachum , Lockit .


Lockit .
The Coronation Account , Brother Peachum , is of so intricate a nature , that I believe it will never be settled .


Peachum .
It consists indeed of a great Variety of Articles .
-- It was worth to our People , in Fees of different kinds , above ten Instalments .
-- This is part of the Account , Brother , that lies open before us .


Lockit .
A Lady 's Tail of rich Brocade .
-- that , I see , is dispos'd of .


Peachum .
To Mrs. Diana Trapes , the Tally-Woman , and she will make a good Hand o n't in Shoes and Slippers , to trick out young Ladies , upon their going into Keeping .
--


Lockit .
But I do n't see any Article of the Jewels .


Peachum .
Those are so well known that they must be sent abroad -- You 'll find them enter'd under the Article of Exportation .
-- As for the Snuff-Boxes , Watches , Swords , c. -- I thought it best to enter them under their several Heads .


Lockit .
Seven and twenty Women 's Pockets complete  with the several things therein contain'd  all Seal'd , Number'd , and Enter'd .


Peachum .
But , Brother , it is impossible for us now to enter upon this Affair , -- We should have the whole Day before us .
-- Besides , the Account of the last Half Year 's Plate is in a Book by itself , which lies at the other Office .


Lockit .
Bring us then more Liquor -- To-day shall be for Pleasure -- To-morrow for Business -- Ah , Brother , those Daughters of ours are two slippery Hussies -- Keep a watchful Eye upon Polly , and Macheath in a Day or two shall be our own again .

Peachum .
But what signifies catching the Bird , if your Daughter Lucy will set open the Door of the Cage ?


Lockit .
If men were answerable for the Follies and Frailties of their Wives and Daughters , no Friends could keep a good Correspondence together for two Days .
-- This in unkind of you , Brother  for among good Friends , what they say or do goes for nothing .


Enter a Servant .


Servant .
Sir , here 's Mrs. Diana Trapes wants to speak with you .


Peachum .
Shall we admit her , Brother Lockit ?

By all means , -- She 's a good Customer , and a fine-spoken Woman -- And a Woman who drinks and talks so freely , will enliven the Conversation .

But now , Mr. Peachum , to our Business .
-- If you have Blacks of any kind , brought in of late  Mantoes -- Velvet Scarfs -- Petticoats -- Let it be what it will -- I am your Chap -- for all my Ladies are very fond of Mourning .


Peachum .
Why , look ye , Mrs. Dye -- you deal so hard with us , that we can afford to give the Gentlemen , who venture their Lives for the Goods , little or nothing .


Mrs. Trapes .
The hard Times oblige me to go very near in my Dealing .
-- To be sure , of late Years I have been a great Sufferer by the Parliament .
-- Three thousand Pounds would hardly make me amends .
-- The Act for destroying the Mint , was a severe Cut upon our Business -- 'Till then , if a Customer stept out of the way -- we knew where to have her -- No doubt you know Mrs. Coaxer -- there 's a Wench now ( 'till to-day ) with a good Suit of Clothes of mine upon her Back , and I could never set Eyes upon her for three Months together .
-- Since the Act too against Imprisonment for small Sums , my Loss there too hath been very considerable , and it must be so , when a Lady can borrow a handsom Petticoat , or a clean Gown , and I not have the least Hank upon her !
And , o ' my Conscience , now-a-days most Ladies take a Delight in cheating , when they can do it with Safety .


Peachum .
Madam , you had a handsom Gold Watch of us ` tother Day for seven Guineas .
-- Considering we must have our Profit .
-- To a Gentleman upon the Road , a Gold Watch will be scarce worth the taking .


Mrs. Trapes .
Consider , Mr. Peachum , that Watch was remarkable , and not of very safe Sale .
-- If you have any black Velvet Scarfs -- they are a handsom Winter-wear , and take with most Gentlemen who deal with my Customers .
-- 'T is I that put the Ladies upon a good Foot .
'T is not Youth or Beauty that fixes their Price .
The Gentlemen always pay according to their Dress , from half a Crown to two Guineas  and yet those Hussies make nothing of bilking of me .
-- Then too , allowing for Accidents .
-- I have eleven fine Customers now down under the Surgeon 's Hands -- what with Fees and other Expenses , there are great Goings-out , and no Comings in , and not a Farthing to pay for at least a Month 's Clothing .
-- We run great Risques -- great Risques indeed .


Peachum .
As I remember , you said something just now of Mrs. Coaxer .


Mrs. Trapes .
Yes , Sir .
-- To be sure I stript her of a Suit of my own Clothes about two Hours ago  and have left her as she should be , in her Shift , with a Lover of hers at my House .
She call'd him up Stairs , as he was going to Mary-bone in a Hackney Coach .
-- And I hope , for her own sake and mine , she will persuade the Captain to redeem her , for the Captain is very generous to the Ladies .


Lockit .
What Captain ?


Mrs. Trapes .
He thought I did not know him -- An intimate Acquaintance of yours , Mr. Peachum -- Only Captain Macheath -- as fine as a Lord .


Peachum .
To-morrow , dear Mrs. Dye , you shall set your own Price upon any of the Goods you like -- We have at least half a Dozen Velvet Scarfs , and all at your Service .
Will you give me leave to make you a Present of this Suit of Night-clothes for your own wearing ?
-- But are you sure it is Captain Macheath .


Mrs. Trapes .
Though he thinks I have forgot him  no body knows him better .
I have taken a great deal of the Captain 's Money in my Time at second-hand , for he always lov'd to have his Ladies well drest .


Peachum .
Mr. Lockit and I have a little Business with the Captain  -- You understand me -- and we will satisfy you for Mrs. Coaxer 's Debt .


Lockit .
Depend upon it -- we will deal like Men of Honour .


Mrs. Trapes .
I do n't enquire after your Affairs -- so whatever happens , I wash my Hands o n't -- It hath always been my Maxim , that one Friend should assist another -- But if you please -- I 'll take one of the Scarfs home with me .
'T is always good to have something in Hand .

But , Miss Polly -- in the way of Friendship , will you give me leave to propose a Glass of Cordial to you ?


Polly .
Strong-Waters are apt to give me the Head-ache -- I hope , Madam , you will excuse me .


Lucy .
Not the greatest Lady in the Land could have better in her Closet , for her own private drinking .
-- You seem mighty low in Spirits , my Dear .


Polly .
I am sorry , Madam , my Health will not allow me to accept of your Offer .
-- I should not have left you in the rude manner I did when we met last , Madam , had not my Papa haul'd me away so unexpectedly -- I was indeed somewhat provok'd , and perhaps might use some Expressions that were disrespectful .
-- But really , Madam , the Captain treated me with so much Contempt and Cruelty , that I deserv'd your Pity , rather than your Resentment .


Lucy .
But since his Escape , no doubt all Matters are made up again .
-- Ah Polly !
Polly !
't is I am the unhappy Wife  and he loves you as if you were only his Mistress .


Polly .
Sure , Madam , you can not think me so happy as to be the object of your Jealousy .

Would Fate to me Belinda give .


[ Music ]


Among the Men , Coquettes we find , Who court by turns all Woman-kind  And we grant all their Hearts desir'd , When they are flatter'd , and admir'd .


The Coquettes of both Sexes are Self-lovers , and that is a Love no other whatever can dispossess .
I hear , my dear Lucy , our Husband is one of those .


Lucy .
Away with these melancholy Reflections , -- indeed , my dear Polly , we are both of us a Cup too low -- Let me prevail upon you to accept of my Offer .


AIR L. Come , sweet Lass .


[ Music ]


Come , sweet Lass , Let 's banish Sorrow 'Till To-morrow  Come , sweet Lass , Let 's take a chirping Glass .
Wine can clear The Vapours of Despair And make us light as Air  Then drink , and banish Care .


I ca n't bear , Child , to see you in such low Spirits .
-- And I must persuade you to what I know will do you good .
[ Aside . ]
I shall now soon be even with the hypocrytical Strumpet .
[ Exit .


Polly .
All this Wheedling of Lucy can not be for nothing .
-- At this time too !
when I know she hates me !
-- The Dissembling of a Woman is always the Forerunner of Mischief .
-- By pouring Strong-Waters down my Throat , she thinks to pump some Secrets out of me , -- I 'll be upon my Guard , and wo n't taste a Drop of her Liquor , I 'm resolv'd .


Re-enter Lucy , with Strong-Waters .


Lucy .
Come , Miss Polly .


Polly .
Indeed , Child , you have given yourself trouble to no purpose .
-- You must , my Dear , excuse me .


Lucy .
Really , Miss Polly , you are as squeamishly affected about taking a Cup of Strong-Waters as a Lady before Company .
I vow , Polly , I shall take it monstrously ill if you refuse me .
-- Brandy and Men ( though Women love them ever so well ) are always taken by us with some Reluctance -- unless 't is in private .


Polly .
I protest , Madam , it goes against me .
-- What do I see !
Macheath again in Custody !
-- Now every Glimm ` ring of Happiness is lost .


[ Drops the Glass of Liquor on the Ground .


Lucy .
Since things are thus , I 'm glad the Wench hath escap'd : for by this Event , 't is plain , she was not happy enough to deserve to be poison'd .


Enter Lockit , Macheath , Peachum .


Lockit .
Set your Heart to rest , Captain .
-- You have neither the Chance of Love or Money for another Escape , -- for you are order'd to be call'd down upon your Trial immediately .


Peachum .
Away , Hussies !
-- This is not a Time for a Man to be hamper'd with his Wives .
-- You see , the Gentleman is in Chains already .


Lucy .
O Husband , Husband , my Heart long'd to see thee  but to see thee thus distracts me ?


Polly .
Will not my dear Husband look upon his Polly ?
Why hadst thou not flown to me for Protection ?
with me thou hadst been safe .


AIR LI .
The last time I went o'er the Moor .


[ Music ]


Polly .
Hither , dear Husband , turn your Eyes .


Lucy .
Bestow one Glance to cheer me .


Polly .
Think with that Look , thy Polly dies .


Lucy .
O shun me not -- but hear me .


Polly .
'T is Polly sues .


Lucy .
-- 'T is Lucy speaks .


Polly .
Is thus true Love requited ?


Lucy .
My Heart is bursting .


Polly .
-- Mine too breaks .


Lucy .
Must I


Polly .
-- Must I be slighted ?


Macheath .
What would you have me say , Ladies ?
-- You see this affair will soon be at an end , without my disobliging either of you .


Peachum .
But the settling this Point , Captain , might prevent a Law-Suit between your two Widows .


AIR LII .
Tom Tinker 's my true Love .


[ Music ]


Macheath .
Which way shall I turn me -- How can I decide ?
Wives , the Day of our Death , are as fond as a Bride .
One Wife is too much for most Husbands to hear , But two at a time there 's no mortal can bear .
This way , and that way , and which way I will , What would comfort the one , t' other Wife would take ill .


Polly .
But if his own Misfortunes have made him insensible to mine -- A Father sure will be more compassionate -- Dear , dear Sir , sink the material Evidence , and bring him off at his Trial -- Polly upon her Knees begs it of you .


AIR LIII .
I am a poor Shepherd undone .


[ Music ]


When my Heroe in Court appears , And stands arraign'd for his Life  Then think of poor Polly 's Tears  For Ah !
poor Polly 's his Wife .
Like the Sailor he holds up his hand , Distrest on the dashing Wave .
To die a dry Death at Land , Is as bad as a watery Grave .
And alas , poor Polly !
Alack , and well-a-day !
Before I was in Love , Oh !
every Month was May .


Lucy .
If Peachum 's Heart is harden'd  sure you , Sir , will have more Compassion on a Daughter .
-- I know the Evidence is in your Power .
-- How then can you be a Tyrant to me ?
[ Kneeling .


AIR LIV .
Ianthe the lovely , c..


[ Music ]


When he holds up his Hand arraign'd for his Life , O think of your Daughter , and think I 'm his Wife !
What are Canons , or Bombs , or clashing of Swords ?
For Death is more certain by Witnesses Words .
Then nail up their Lips  that dread Thunder allay  And each Month of my Life will hereafter be May .


Lockit .
Macheath 's Time is come , Lucy .
-- We know our own Affairs , therefore let us have no more Whimpering or Whining .


AIR LV .
A Cobler there was , c..


[ Music ]


Ourselves , like the Great , to secure a Retreat , When Matters require it , must give up our Gang : And good reason why , Or , instead of the Fry , Ev'n Peachum and I. Like poor petty Rascals , might hang , hang  Like poor petty Rascals , might hang .


Peachum .
Set your Heart at rest , Polly .
-- Your Husband is to die to-day .
-- Therefore if you are not already provided , 't is high time to look about for another .
There 's Comfort for you , you Slut .


Lockit .
We are ready , Sir , to conduct you to the Old Baily .


AIR LVI .
Bonny Dundee .


[ Music ]


Macheath .
The Charge is prepar'd  the Lawyers are met , The Judges all rang'd ( a terrible Show ! )
I go , undismay'd .
-- For Death is a Debt , A Debt on Demand .
-- So take what I owe .
Then farewell , my Love -- Dear Charmers , adieu .
Contented I die -- 'T is the better for you .
Here ends all Disputes the rest of our Lives , For this way at once I please all my Wives .


Now , Gentlemen , I am ready to attend you .


[ Exeunt Macheath , Lockit , and Peachum .


Enter Filch .


Polly .
Follow them , Filch , to the Court .
And when the Trial is over , bring me a particular Account of his Behaviour , and of every thing that happen'd -- You 'll find me here with Miss Lucy .
[ Exit Filch . ]
But why is all this Musick ?


Lucy .
The Prisoners , whose Trials are put off 'till next Session , are diverting themselves .


Polly .
Sure there is nothing so charming as Music !
I 'm fond of it to Distraction !
-- But alas !
-- now , all Mirth seems an Insult upon my Affliction .
-- Let us retire , my dear Lucy , and indulge our Sorrows .
-- The noisy Crew , you see , are coming upon us .

SCENE V .
The Condemn'd Hold .


Macheath , in a melancholy Posture .


AIR LVII .
Happy Groves .


[ Music ]


O cruel , cruel , cruel Case !
Must I suffer this Disgrace ?


AIR LVIII .
Of all the Girls that are so smart .


[ Music ]


Of all the Friends in time of Grief , When threatning Death looks grimmer , Not one so sure can bring Relief , As this best Friend , a Brimmer .

AIR LIX .
Britons strike home .

Since I must swing , -- I scorn , I scorn to wince or whine .

AIR LX .
Chevy Chase .

But now again my Spirits sink  I 'll raise them high with Wine .
[ Drinks a Glass of Wine .


AIR LXI .
To old Sir Simon the King .


[ Music ]


But Valour the stronger grows , The stronger Liquor we'er drinking  And how can we feel our Woes , When we 've lost the Trouble of Thinking ?
[ Drinks .


AIR LXII .
Joy to Great CÃ¦sar .


[ Music ]


If thus -- A Man can die Much bolder with Brandy .
[ Pours out a Bumper of Brandy .


AIR LXIII .
There was an old Woman .


[ Music ]


So I drink off this Bumper .
-- And now I can stand the Test , And my Comrades shall see , that I die as brave as the Best .


[ Drinks .


AIR LXIV .
Did you ever hear of a gallant Sailor .


[ Music ]


But can I leave my pretty Hussies , Without one Tear , or tender Sigh ?


AIR LXV .
Why are mine Eyes still flowing .


[ Music ]


Their Eyes , their Lips , their Busses Recall my Love , -- Ah must I die !


AIR LXVI .
Green Sleeves .


[ Music ]


Since Laws were made for ev'ry Degree , To curb Vice in others , as well as me , I wonder we ha n't better Company , Upon Tyburn Tree !
But Gold from Law can take out the Sting  And if rich Men like us were to swing , 'Twou'd thin the Land , such Numbers to string Upon Tyburn Tree !


Jailor .
Some Friends of yours , Captain , desire to be admitted -- I leave you together .


Enter Ben Budge , Matt of the Mint .


Macheath .
For my having broke Prison , you see , Gentlemen , I am order'd immediate Execution .
-- The Sheriff 's Officers , I believe , are now at the Door .
-- That Jemmy Twitcher should peach me , I own surpris'd me !
-- 'T is a plain Proof that the World is all alike , and that even our Gang can no more trust one another than other People .
Therefore , I beg you , Gentlemen , look well to yourselves , for in all probability you may live some Months longer .


Matt .
We are heartily sorry , Captain , for your Misfortune .
-- But 't is what we must all come to .


Macheath .
Peachum and Lockit , you know , are infamous Scoundrels .
Their Lives are as much in your Power , as yours are in theirs .
-- Remember your dying Friend !
-- 'T is my last Request .
-- Bring those Villains to the Gallows before you , and I am satisfied .


Matt .
We 'll do ` t .


Jailor .
Miss Polly and Miss Lucy intreat a Word with you .


Macheath .
Gentlemen , adieu .


[ Exeunt Ben Budge and Matt .


Enter Lucy and Polly .


Macheath .
My dear Lucy -- My dear Polly -- Whatsoever hath pass'd between us is now at an end -- If you are fond of marrying again , the best Advice I can give you , is to Ship yourselves off for the West-Indies , where you 'll have a fair Chance of getting a Husband a-piece , or by good Luck , two or three , as you like best .


Polly .
How can I support this Sight !


Lucy .
There is nothing moves one so much as a great Man in Distress .


AIR LXVII .
All you that must take a Leap , c..


[ Music ]


Lucy .
Would I might be hang'd !


Polly .
-- And I would so too !


Lucy .
To be hang'd with you .


Polly .
-- My Dear , with you .


Macheath .
O leave me to Thought !
I fear !
I doubt !
I tremble !
I droop !
-- See , my Courage is out .


[ Turns up the empty Bottle .


Polly .
No Token of Love ?


Macheath .
-- See , my Courage is out .


[ Turns up the empty Pot .


Lucy .
No Token of Love ?


Polly .
-- Adieu .


Lucy .
-- Farewell .


Macheath .
But hark !
I hear the Toll of the Bell .


Chorus .
Tol de rol lol , c..


Jailor .
Four Women more , Captain , with a Child apiece !
See , here they come .


[ Enter Women and Children .


Macheath .
What -- four Wives more !
-- This is too much -- Here -- tell the Sheriff 's Officers I am ready .
[ Exit Macheath guarded .


To them , Enter Player and Beggar .


Player .
But , honest Friend , I hope you do n't intend that Macheath shall be really executed .


Beggar .
Most certainly , Sir .
-- To make the Piece perfect , I was for doing strict poetical Justice .
-- Macheath is to be hang'd  and for the other Personages of the Drama , the Audience must have suppos'd they were all either hang'd or transported .


Player .
Why then , Friend , this is a downright deep Tragedy .
The Catastrophe is manifestly wrong , for an Opera must end happily .


Beggar .
Your Objection , Sir , is very just , and is easily remov'd .
For you must allow , that in this kind of Drama , 't is no matter how absurdly things are brought about -- So -- you Rabble there -- run and cry , A Reprieve !
-- let the Prisoner be brought back to his Wives in Triumph .


Player .
All this we must do , to comply with the Taste of the Town .


Beggar .
Through the whole Piece you may observe such a Similitude of Manners in high and low Life , that it is difficult to determine whether ( in the fashionable Vices ) the fine Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of the Road , or the Gentlemen of the Road the fine Gentlemen .
-- Had the Play remained , as I at first intended , it would have carried a most excellent Moral .
` Twould have shewn that the lower Sort of People have their Vices in a degree as well as the Rich : And that they are punish'd for them .


To them , Macheath with Rabble , c..


Macheath .
So , it seems , I am not left to my Choice , but must have a Wife at last .
-- Look ye , my Dears , we will have no Controversy now .
Let us give this Day to Mirth , and I am sure she who thinks herself my Wife will testify her Joy by a Dance .


All .
Come , a Dance -- a Dance .


Macheath .
Ladies , I hope you will give me leave to present a Partner to each of you .
And ( if I may without Offence ) for this time , I take Polly for mine .
-- And for Life , you Slut , -- for we were really marry'd .
-- As for the rest .
-- But at present keep your own Secret .


[ To Polly .


A DANCE .


AIR LXVIII .
Lumps of Pudding , c..


[ Music ]


Thus I stand like the Turk , with his Doxies around  From all Sides their Glances his Passion confound  For Black , Brown , and Fair , his Inconstancy burns , And the different Beauties subdue him by turns : Each calls forth her Charms to provoke his Desires : Though willing to all , with but one he retires .
But think of this Maxim , and put off your Sorrow , The Wretch of To-day , may be happy To-morrow .


Chorus .
But think of this Maxim , c..
