HOBSON 'S CHOICE


ACT 1


The SCENE represents the interior of HOBSON 'S Boot Shop in Chapel Street , Bedford .
The shop windows and entrance from street occupy the left side .
Facing the audience is the counter , with exhibits of boots and slippers , behind which the wall is fitted with racks containing boot boxes .
Cane chairs in front of counter .
There is a desk down L. with a chair .
A door R. leads up to the house .
In the centre of the stage is a trap leading to the cellar where work is done .
There are no elaborate fittings .
Gas brackets in the windows and walls .
The business is prosperous , but to prosper in Salford in 1880 you did not require the elaborate accessories of a later day .
A very important customer goes for fitting into HOBSON 'S sitting-room .
The rank and file use the cane chairs in the shop , which is dingy but business-like .
The windows exhibit little stock , and amongst what there is clogs figure prominently .
Through the windows comes the bright light of noon .


Sitting behind the counter are HOBSON 'S two younger daughters , ALICE , R. , who is twenty-three , and VICTORIA , L. , who is twenty-one , and very pretty .
ALICE is knitting and VICTORIA is reading .
They are in black , with neat black aprons .
The door R. opens , and MAGGIE enters .
She is HOBSON 'S eldest daughter , thirty .


ALICE .
Oh , it 's you .
I hoped it was father going out .


MAGGIE .
It is n't .
( She crosses and takes her place at desk L. ) ALICE .
He is late this morning .


MAGGIE .
He got up late .
( She busies herself with an account book . )


VICKEY .
( reading ) .
Has he had breakfast yet , Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
Breakfast !
With a Masons ' meeting last night !


VICKEY .
He 'll need reviving .


ALICE .
Then I wish he 'd go and do it .


VICKEY .
Are you expecting anyone , Alice ?


ALICE .
Yes , I am , and you know I am , and I 'll thank you both to go when he comes .


VICKEY .
Well , I 'll oblige you , Alice , if father 's gone out first , only you know I ca n't leave the counter till he goes .


( ALBERT PROSSER enters from the street .
He is twenty-six , nicely dressed , as the son of an established solicitor would be .
He crosses to R. and raises his hat to ALICE . )


ALBERT .
Good morning , Miss Alice .


ALICE .
Good morning , Mr. Prosser .
( She leans across counter . )
Father 's not gone out yet .
He 's late .


ALBERT .
Oh !
( He turns to go , and is half-way to door , when MAGGIE rises . )
MAGGIE ( coming C. ) .
What can we do for you , Mr. Prosser ?


ALBERT ( stopping ) .
Well , I ca n't say that I came in to buy anything , Miss Hobson .


MAGGIE .
This is a shop , you know .
We 're not here to let people go out without buying .


ALBERT .
Well , I 'll just have a pair of bootlaces , please .
( Moves slightly to R. )


MAGGIE .
What size do you take in boots ?


ALBERT .
Eights .
I 've got small feet .
( He simpers , then perceives that MAGGIE is by no means smiling . )
Does that matter to the laces ?


MAGGIE ( putting mat in front of arm-chair R. C. ) It matters to the boots .
( She pushes him slightly . )
Sit down , Mr. Prosser .


ALBERT ( sitting in arm-chair R. C. ) Yes , but -


( MAGGIE is on her knees and takes off his boot . )


MAGGIE .
It 's time you had a new pair .
These uppers are disgraceful for a professional man to wear .
Number eights from the third rack , Vickey , please .


ALICE ( moving down a little ) .
Mr. Prosser did n't come in to buy boots , Maggie .


( VICKEY comes down to MAGGIE with box which she opens . )


MAGGIE .
I wonder what does bring him in here so often !


( ALICE moves back to behind counter . )


ALBERT .
I 'm terrible hard on bootlaces , Miss Hobson .


( MAGGIE puts a new boot on him and laces it . )


MAGGIE .
Do you get through a pair a day ?
You must be strong .


ALBERT .
I keep a little stock of them .
It 's as well to be prepared for accidents .


MAGGIE .
And now you 'll have boots to go with the laces , Mr. Prosser .
How does that feel ?
ALBERT .
Very comfortable .


MAGGIE .
Try it standing up .


ALBERT ( trying and walking a few steps ) .
Yes , that fits all right .


MAGGIE .
I 'll put the other on .


ALBERT .
Oh no , I really do n't want to buy them .


MAGGIE ( pushing him ) .
Sit down , Mr. Prosser .
You ca n't go through the streets in odd boots .


( ALICE comes down again . )


ALBERT .
What 's the price of these ?


MAGGIE .
A pound .


ALBERT .
A pound !
I say -


MAGGIE .
They 're good boots , and you do n't need to buy a pair of laces to-day , because we give them in as discount .
( VICKEY goes back to counter . )
Braid laces , that is .
Of course , if you want leather ones , you being so strong in the arm and breaking so many pairs , you can have them , only it 's tuppence more .


ALBERT .
These - these will do .


MAGGIE .
Very well , you 'd better have the old pair mended and I 'll send them home to you with the bill .
( She has laced the second boot , rises , and moves towards desk L. , throwing the boot box at VICKEY , who gives a little scream at the interruption of her reading .
ALBERT gasps . )


ALBERT .
Well , if anyone had told me I was coming in here to spend a pound I 'd have called him crazy .


MAGGIE .
It 's not wasted .
Those boots will last .
Good morning , Mr. Prosser .
( She holds door open . )
ALBERT .
Good morning .
( He looks blankly at ALICE and goes out . )


ALICE .
Maggie , we know you 're a pushing sales-woman , but -


MAGGIE ( returning to R. she picks up old boots and puts them on rack up R. ) .
It 'll teach him to keep out of here a bit .
He 's too much time on his hands .


ALICE .
You know why he comes .


MAGGIE .
I know it 's time he paid a rent for coming .
A pair of laces a day 's not half enough .
Coming here to make sheep 's eyes at you .
I 'm sick of the sight of him .
( Crosses in front of counter to L. )


ALICE .
It 's all very well for an old maid like you to talk , but if father wo n't have us go courting , where else can Albert meet me except here when father 's out ?


MAGGIE .
If he wants to marry you why does n't he do it ?


ALICE .
Courting must come first .


MAGGIE .
It need n't .
( She picks up a slipper on desk L. ) .
See that slipper with a fancy buckle on to make it pretty ?
Courting 's like that , my lass .
All glitter and no use to nobody .
( She replaces slipper and sits at her desk . )
( HENRY HORATIO HOBSON enters from the house .
He is fifty-five , successful , coarse , florid , and a parent of the period .
His hat is on .
It is one of those felt hats which are half-way to tall hats in shape .
He has a heavy gold chain and masonic emblems on it .
His clothes are bought to wear . )


HOBSON .
Maggie , I 'm just going out for a quarter of an hour .
( Moves over to doors L. )


MAGGIE .
Yes , father .
Do n't be late for dinner .
There 's liver .


HOBSON .
It 's an hour off dinner-time .
( Going . )


MAGGIE .
So that , if you stay more than an hour in the Moonraker 's Inn , you 'll be late for it .
HOBSON .
`` Moonraker 's ? ''
Who said - ?
( Turning . )


VICKEY .
If your dinner 's ruined , it 'll be your own fault .


HOBSON .
Well , I 'll be eternally -


ALICE .
Do n't swear , father .


HOBSON ( putting hat on counter ) .
No .
I 'll sit down instead .
( He moves to R. C. and sits in arm-chair R. C. facing them . )
Listen to me , you three .
I 've come to conclusions about you .
And I wo n't have it .
Do you hear that ?
Interfering with my goings out and comings in .
The idea !
I 've a mind to take measures with the lot of you .


MAGGIE .
I expect Mr. Heeler 's waiting for you in `` Moonraker 's , '' father .


HOBSON .
He can go on waiting .
At present , I 'm addressing a few remarks to the rebellious females of this house , and what I say will be listened to and heeded .
I 've noticed it coming on ever since your mother died .
There 's been a gradual increase of uppishness towards me .


VICKEY .
Father , you 'd have more time to talk after we 've closed to-night .
( She is anxious to resume her reading . )


HOBSON .
I 'm talking now , and you 're listening .
Providence has decreed that you should lack a mother 's hand at the time when single girls grow bumptious and must have somebody to rule .
But I 'll tell you this , you 'll none rule me .


VICKEY .
I 'm sure I 'm not bumptious , father .


HOBSON .
Yes , you are .
You 're pretty , but you 're bumptious , and I hate bumptiousness like I hate a lawyer .


ALICE .
If we take trouble to feed you it 's not bumptious to ask you not to be late for your food .


VICKEY .
Give and take , father .


HOBSON .
I give and you take , and it 's going to end .


MAGGIE .
How much a week do you give us ?


HOBSON .
That 's neither here nor there .
( Rises and moves to doors L. ) At moment I 'm on uppishness , and I 'm warning you your conduct towards your parent 's got to change .
( Turns to the counter . )
But that 's not all .
That 's private conduct , and now I pass to broader aspects and I speak of public conduct .
I 've looked upon my household as they go about the streets , and I 've been disgusted .
The fair name and fame of Hobson have been outraged by members of Hobson 's family , and uppishness has done it .


VICKEY .
I do n't know what you 're talking about .


HOBSON .
Vickey , you 're pretty , but you can lie like a gas-meter .
Who had new dresses on last week ?
ALICE .
I suppose you mean Vickey and me !


HOBSON .
I do .


VICKEY .
We shall dress as we like , father , and you can save your breath .


HOBSON .
I 'm not stopping in from my business appointment for the purpose of saving my breath .


VICKEY .
You like to see me in nice clothes .


HOBSON .
I do .
I like to see my daughters nice .
( Crosses R. ) That 's why I pay Mr. Tudsbury , the draper , 10 pounds a year a head to dress you proper .
It pleases the eye and it 's good for trade .
But , I 'll tell you , if some women could see themselves as men see them , they 'd have a shock , and I 'll have words with Tudsbury an ' all , for letting you dress up like guys .
( Moves L. ) I saw you and Alice out of the `` Moonraker 's '' parlour on Thursday night and my friend Sam Minns - ( Turns . )


ALICE .
A publican .


HOBSON .
Aye , a publican .
As honest a man as God Almighty ever set behind a bar , my ladies .
My friend , Sam Minns , asked me who you were .
And well he might .
You were going down Chapel Street with a hump added to nature behind you .


VICKEY ( scandalized ) .
Father !


HOBSON .
The hump was wagging , and you put your feet on pavement as if you 'd got chilblains - aye , stiff neck above and weak knees below .
It 's immodest !


ALICE .
It is not immodest , father .
It 's the fashion to wear bustles .


HOBSON .
Then to hell with the fashion .


MAGGIE .
Father , you are not in the `` Moonraker 's '' now .


VICKEY .
You should open your eyes to what other ladies wear .
( Rises . )


HOBSON .
If what I saw on you is any guide , I should do nowt of kind .
I 'm a decent-minded man .
I 'm Hobson .
I 'm British middle class and proud of it .
I stand for common sense and sincerity .
You 're affected , which is bad sense and insincerity .
You 've overstepped nice dressing and you 've tried grand dressing - ( VICKEY sits ) - which is the occupation of fools and such as have no brains .
You forget the majesty of trade and the unparalleled virtues of the British Constitution which are all based on the sanity of the middle classes , combined with the diligence of the working-classes .
You 're losing balance , and you 're putting the things which do n't matter in front of the things which do , and if you mean to be a factor in the world in Lancashire or a factor in the house of Hobson , you 'll become sane .


VICKEY .
Do you want us to dress like mill girls ?


HOBSON .
No .
Nor like French Madams , neither .
It 's un-English , I say .


ALICE .
We shall continue to dress fashionably , father .


HOBSON .
Then I 've a choice for you two .
Vickey , you I 'm talking to , and Alice .
You 'll become sane if you 're going on living here .
You 'll control this uppishness that 's growing on you .
And if you do n't , you 'll get out of this , and exercise your gifts on some one else than me .
You do n't know when you 're well off .
But you 'll learn it when I 'm done with you .
I 'll choose a pair of husbands for you , my girls .
That 's what I 'll do .


ALICE .
Ca n't we choose husbands for ourselves ?


HOBSON .
I 've been telling you for the last five minutes you 're not even fit to choose dresses for yourselves .


MAGGIE .
You 're talking a lot to Vickey and Alice , father .
Where do I come in ?


HOBSON .
You ?
( Turning on her , astonished . )


MAGGIE .
If you 're dealing husbands round , do n't I get one ?


HOBSON .
Well , that 's a good one !
( Laughs . )
You with a husband !
( Down in front of desk . )


MAGGIE .
Why not ?


HOBSON .
Why not ?
I thought you 'd sense enough to know .
But if you want the brutal truth , you 're past the marrying age .
You 're a proper old maid , Maggie , if ever there was one .


MAGGIE .
I 'm thirty .


HOBSON ( facing her ) .
Aye , thirty and shelved .
Well , all the women ca n't get husbands .
But you others , now .
I 've told you .
I 'll have less uppishness from you or else I 'll shove you off my hands on to some other men .
You can just choose which way you like .
( He picks up hat and makes for door . )


MAGGIE .
One o'clock dinner , father .


HOBSON .
See here , Maggie , - ( back again down to in front of desk ) - I set the hours at this house .
It 's one o'clock dinner because I say it is , and not because you do .


MAGGIE .
Yes , father .


HOBSON .
So long as that 's clear I 'll go .
( He is by door . )
Oh no , I wo n't .
Mrs. Hepworth 's getting out of her carriage .
( He puts hat on counter again .
MAGGIE rises and opens door .
Enter MRS. HEPWORTH , an old lady with a curt manner and good clothes . )


Good morning , Mrs. Hepworth .
What a lovely day .
( He crosses R. and places chair . )


MRS. HEPWORTH ( sitting in arm-chair R. C. ) .
Morning , Hobson .
( She raises her skirt . )
I 've come about those boots you sent me home .


HOBSON ( kneeling on MRS. HEPWORTH 'S R. , and fondling foot .
MAGGIE is C. ) .
Yes , Mrs. Hepworth .
They look very nice .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Get up , Hobson .
( He scrambles up , controlling his feelings . )
You look ridiculous on the floor .
Who made these boots ?


HOBSON .
We did .
Our own make .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Will you answer a plain question ?
Who made these boots ?


HOBSON .
They were made on the premises .


MRS. HEPWORTH ( to MAGGIE ) .
Young woman , you seemed to have some sense when you served me .
Can you answer me ?


MAGGIE .
I think so , but I 'll make sure for you , Mrs. Hepworth .
( She opens trap and calls . )
Tubby !


HOBSON ( down R. ) .
You wish to see the identical workman , madam ?


MRS. HEPWORTH .
I said so .


HOBSON .
I am responsible for all work turned out here .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
I never said you were n't .


( TUBBY WADLOW comes up trap .
A white-haired little man with thin legs and a paunch , in dingy clothes with no collar and a coloured cotton shirt .
He has no coat on . )


TUBBY .
Yes , Miss Maggie ?
( He stands half out of trap , not coming right up . )


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Man , did you make these boots ?
( She rises and advances one pace towards him . )


TUBBY .
No , ma'am .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Then who did ?
Am I to question every soul in the place before I find out ?
( Looking round . )


TUBBY .
They 're Willie 's making , those .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Then tell Willie I want him .


TUBBY .
Certainly , ma'am .
( He goes down trap and calls `` Willie ! '' )
MRS. HEPWORTH .
Who 's Willie ?


HOBSON .
Name of Mossop , madam .
But if there is anything wrong I assure you I 'm capable of making the man suffer for it .
I 'll -


( WILLIE MOSSOP comes up trap .
He is a lanky fellow , about thirty , not naturally stupid but stunted mentally by a brutalized childhood .
He is a raw material of a charming man , but , at present , it requires a very keen eye to detect his potentialities .
His clothes are an even poorer edition of TUBBY 'S .
He comes half-way up trap . )


MRS. HEPWORTH ( standing R. of trap ) .
Are you Mossop ?
WILLIE .
Yes , mum .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
You made these boots ?


WILLIE ( peering at them ) .
Yes , I made them last week .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Take that .


( WILLIE , bending down , rather expects `` that '' to be a blow .
Then he raises his head and finds she is holding out a visiting card .
He takes it . )


See what 's on it ?


WILLIE ( bending over the card ) .
Writing ?


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Read it .


WILLIE .
I 'm trying .
( His lips move as he tries to spell it out . )


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Bless the man .
Ca n't you read ?


WILLIE .
I do a bit .
Only it 's such funny print .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
It 's the usual italics of a visiting card , my man .
Now listen to me .
I heard about this shop , and what I heard brought me here for these boots .
I 'm particular about what I put on my feet .


HOBSON ( moving slightly towards her ) .
I assure you it shall not occur again , Mrs. Hepworth .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
What sha n't ?


HOBSON ( crestfallen ) .
I - I do n't know .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
Then hold your tongue .
Mossop , I 've tried every shop in Manchester , and these are the best-made pair of boots I 've ever had .
Now , you 'll make my boots in future .
You hear that , Hobson ?


( MAGGIE , down L. C. , is taking it all in . )


HOBSON .
Yes , madam , of course he shall .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
You 'll keep that card , Mossop , and you wo n't dare leave here to go to another shop without letting me know where you are .


HOBSON .
Oh , he wo n't make a change .


MRS. HEPWORTH .
How do you know ?
The man 's a treasure , and I expect you underpay him .


HOBSON .
That 'll do , Willie .
You can go .


WILLIE .
Yes , sir .


( He dives down trap .
MAGGIE closes it . )


MRS. HEPWORTH .
He 's like a rabbit .


MAGGIE .
Can I take your order for another pair of boots , Mrs. Hepworth ?
MRS. HEPWORTH .
Not yet , young woman .
But I shall send my daughters here .
And , mind you , that man 's to make the boots .
( She crosses L. )


MAGGIE .
( Up at doors and opening them . )
Certainly , Mrs. Hepworth .
MRS. HEPWORTH .
Good morning .


HOBSON .
Good morning , Mrs. Hepworth .
Very glad to have the honour of serving you , madam .
( Following her up . )


( She goes out . )


( Angry . )
I wish some people would mind their own business .
What does she want to praise a workman to his face for ?
( Moves down L. and then to C. )


MAGGIE .
I suppose he deserved it .


HOBSON .
Deserved be blowed !
Making them uppish .
That 's what it is .
Last time she puts her foot in my shop , I give you my word .


MAGGIE .
Do n't be silly , father .


HOBSON .
I 'll show her .
Thinks she owns the earth because she lives at Hope Hall .


( Enter from street JIM HEELER , who is a grocer , and HOBSON 'S boon companion . )


JIM ( looking down street as he enters ) .
That 's a bit of a startler .


HOBSON ( swinging round ) .
Eh ?
Oh , morning , Jim .


JIM .
You 're doing a good class trade if the carriage folk come to you , Hobson .
( Moves down L. C. )


HOBSON .
What ?


JIM .
Was n't that Mrs. Hepworth ?


HOBSON .
Oh yes .
Mrs. Hepworth 's an old and valued customer of mine .


JIM .
It 's funny you deal with Hope Hall and never mentioned it .


HOBSON .
Why , I 've made boots for her and all her circle for - how long , Maggie ?
Oh , I dunno .


JIM .
You kept it dark .
Well , are n't you coming round yonder ?
( Moving up L. )


HOBSON ( reaching for his hat ) .
Yes .
That is , no .


JIM .
Are you ill ?


HOBSON .
No .
Get away , you girls .
I 'll look after the shop .
I want to talk to Mr. Heeler .


JIM .
Well , ca n't you talk in the `` Moonraker 's '' !


( The girls go out R. to house , MAGGIE last . )


HOBSON .
Yes , with Sam Minns , and Denton and Tudsbury there .


JIM .
It 's private , then .
What 's the trouble , Henry ?


( HOBSON waves JIM into arm-chair R. C. and sits in front of counter . )


HOBSON .
They 're the trouble .
( Indicates door to house . )
Do your daughters worry you , Jim ?


JIM .
Nay , - ( sits R. C. ) - they mostly do as I bid them , and the missus does the leathering if they do n't .


HOBSON .
Ah , Jim , a wife 's a handy thing , and you do n't know it proper till she 's taken from you .
I felt grateful for the quiet when my Mary fell on rest , but I can see my mistake now .
I used to think I was hard put to it to fend her off when she wanted summat out of me , but the dominion of one woman is Paradise to the dominion of three .


JIM .
It sounds a sad case , Henry .


HOBSON .
I 'm a talkative man by nature , Jim .
You know that .


JIM .
You 're an orator , Henry .
I doubt John Bright himself is better gifted of the gab than you .


HOBSON .
Nay , that 's putting it a bit too strong .
A good case needs no flattery .


JIM .
Well , you 're the best debater in the `` Moonraker 's '' parlour .


HOBSON .
And that 's no more than truth .
Yes , Jim , in the estimation of my fellow men , I give forth words of weight .
In the eyes of my daughters I 'm a windbag .
( Rises and moves down L. ) .


JIM .
Nay .
Never !


HOBSON .
I am .
( Turns . )
They scorn my wisdom , Jim .
They answer back .
I 'm landed in a hole - a great and undignified hole .
My own daughters have got the upper hand of me .


JIM .
Women are worse than men for getting above themselves .


HOBSON .
A woman 's foolishness begins where man 's leaves off .


JIM .
They want a firm hand , Henry .


HOBSON .
I 've lifted up my voice and roared at them .


JIM .
Beware of roaring at women , Henry .
Roaring is mainly hollow sound .
It 's like trying to defeat an army with banging drums instead of cold steel .
And it 's steel in a man 's character that subdues the women .


HOBSON .
I 've tried all ways , and I 'm fair moithered .
I dunno what to do .
( Scratches his head . )


JIM .
Then you quit roaring at 'em and get 'em wed. ( Rises . )


HOBSON .
I 've thought of that .
Trouble is to find the men .


JIM .
Men 's common enough .
Are you looking for angels in breeches ?


HOBSON .
I 'd like my daughters to wed temperance young men , Jim .


JIM .
You keep your ambitions within reasonable limits , Henry .
You 've three daughters to find husbands for .
HOBSON .
Two , Jim , two .


JIM .
Two ?


HOBSON .
Vickey and Alice are mostly window dressing in the shop .
But Maggie 's too useful to part with .
And she 's a bit on the ripe side for marrying , is our Maggie .


JIM .
I 've seen 'em do it at double her age .
Still , leaving her out , you 've two .


HOBSON .
One 'll do for a start , Jim .
( Crosses to R. ) It 's a thing I 've noticed about wenches .
Get one wedding in a family and it goes through the lot like measles .
( Moves round chair to up R. )


JIM .
Well , you want a man , and you want him temperance .
It 'll cost you a bit , you know .
( Sits in chair below L. side of counter . )


HOBSON ( going to him ) .
Eh ?
Oh , I 'll get my hand down for the wedding all right .


JIM .
A warm man like you ` ull have to do more than that .
There 's things called settlements .


HOBSON .
Settlements ?


JIM .
Aye .
You 've to bait your hook to catch fish , Henry .


HOBSON .
Then I 'll none go fishing .
( Sits . )


JIM .
But you said -


HOBSON .
I 've changed my mind .
I 'd a fancy for a bit of peace , but there 's luxuries a man can buy too dear .
Settlements indeed !


JIM .
I had a man in mind .


HOBSON .
You keep him there , Jim .
I 'll rub along and chance it .
Settlements indeed !
JIM .
You save their keep .


HOBSON .
They work for that .
And they 're none of them big eaters .


JIM .
And their wages .


HOBSON .
Wages ?
Do you think I pay wages to my own daughters ?
( Rises and goes to desk L. ) I 'm not a fool .


JIM .
Then it 's all off ?
( Rises . )


HOBSON ( turns ) .
From the moment that you breathed the word `` settlements '' it was dead off , Jim .
Let 's go to the `` Moonraker 's '' and forget there 's such a thing as women in the world .
( He takes up hat and rings bell on counter . )
Shop !
Shop !


( MAGGIE enters from R. )


I 'm going out , Maggie .


MAGGIE ( She remains by door ) .
Dinner 's at one , remember .


HOBSON .
Dinner will be when I come in for it .
I 'm master here .
( Moves to go . )


MAGGIE .
Yes , father .
One o'clock .


HOBSON ( disgusted . )
Come along , Jim .


( JIM and HOBSON go out to street .
MAGGIE turns to speak inside R. door . )
MAGGIE .
Dinner at half-past one , girls .
We 'll give him half an hour .
( She closes door , turns arm-chair facing C. and moves to trap , which she raises . )
Willie , come here .


( In a moment WILLIE appears , and stops half-way up . )


WILLIE .
Yes , Miss Maggie ?


MAGGIE ( L. of trap . )
Come up , and put the trap down , I want to talk to you .


( He comes , reluctantly . )


WILLIE .
We 're very busy in the cellar .


( MAGGIE points to trap .
He closes it . )


MAGGIE .
Show me your hands , Willie .


WILLIE .
They 're dirty .
( He holds them out hesitatingly . )


MAGGIE .
Yes , they 're dirty , but they 're clever .
They can shape the leather like no other man 's that ever came into the shop .
Who taught you , Willie ?
( She retains his hands . )


WILLIE .
Why , Miss Maggie , I learnt my trade here .


MAGGIE .
Hobson 's never taught you to make boots the way you do .


WILLIE .
I 've had no other teacher .


MAGGIE ( dropping his hands . )
And needed none .
You 're a natural born genius at making boots .
It 's a pity you 're a natural fool at all else .


WILLIE .
I 'm not much good at owt but leather , and that 's a fact .


MAGGIE .
When are you going to leave Hobson 's ?


WILLIE .
Leave Hobson 's ?
I - I thought I gave satisfaction .


MAGGIE .
Do n't you want to leave ?


WILLIE .
Not me .
I 've been at Hobson 's all my life , and I 'm not for leaving till I 'm made .


MAGGIE .
I said you were a fool .


WILLIE .
Then I 'm a loyal fool .


MAGGIE .
Do n't you want to get on , Will Mossop ?
You heard what Mrs. Hepworth said .
You know the wages you get and you know the wages a bootmaker like you could get in one of the big shops in Manchester .
WILLIE .
Nay , I 'd be feared to go in them fine places .


MAGGIE .
What keeps you here ?
Is it the - the people ?


WILLIE .
I dunno what it is .
I 'm used to being here .


MAGGIE .
Do you know what keeps this business on its legs ?
Two things : one 's the good boots you make that sell themselves , the other 's the bad boots other people make and I sell .
We 're a pair , Will Mossop .


WILLIE .
You 're a wonder in the shop , Miss Maggie .


MAGGIE .
And you 're a marvel in the workshop .
Well ?


WILLIE .
Well , what ?


MAGGIE .
It seems to me to point one way .


WILLIE .
What way is that ?


MAGGIE .
You 're leaving me to do the work , my lad .


WILLIE .
I 'll be getting back to my stool , Miss Maggie .
( Moves to trap . )


MAGGIE ( stopping him ) .
You 'll go back when I 've done with you .
I 've watched you for a long time and everything I 've seen , I 've liked .
I think you 'll do for me .


WILLIE .
What way , Miss Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
Will Mossop , you 're my man .
Six months I 've counted on you and it 's got to come out some time .


WILLIE .
But I never -


MAGGIE .
I know you never , or it ` ud not be left to me to do the job like this .


WILLIE .
I 'll - I 'll sit down .
( He sits in arm-chair , mopping his brow . )
I 'm feeling queer-like .
What dost want me for ?


MAGGIE .
To invest in .
You 're a business idea in the shape of a man .


WILLIE .
I 've got no head for business at all .


MAGGIE .
But I have .
My brain and your hands ` ull make a working partnership .


WILLIE ( getting up , relieved ) .
Partnership !
Oh , that 's a different thing .
I thought you were axing me to wed you .
( Moves up stage . )


MAGGIE .
I am .


WILLIE ( sitting in front of counter ) .
Well , by gum !
And you the master 's daughter .


MAGGIE .
Maybe that 's why , Will Mossop .
( Moving up stage . )
Maybe I 've had enough of father , and you 're as different from him as any man I know .
( Sits L. of him . )


WILLIE .
It 's a bit awkward-like .


MAGGIE .
And you do n't help me any , lad .
What 's awkward about it ?


WILLIE .
You talking to me like this .


MAGGIE .
I 'll tell you something , Will .
It 's a poor sort of woman who 'll stay lazy when she sees her best chance slipping from her .
A Salford life 's too near the bone to lose things through the fear of speaking out .


WILLIE .
I 'm your best chance ?


MAGGIE .
You are that , Will .


WILLIE .
Well , by gum !
( Rises . )
I never thought of this .


MAGGIE .
Think of it now .


WILLIE .
I am doing .
Only the blow 's a bit too sudden to think very clear .
I 've a great respect for you , Miss Maggie .
You 're a shapely body , and you 're a masterpiece at selling in the shop , but when it comes to marrying , I 'm bound to tell you that I 'm none in love with you .


MAGGIE .
Wait till you 're asked .
( Rises . )
I want your hand in mine and your word for it that you 'll go through life with me for the best we can get out of it .


WILLIE .
We 'd not get much without there 's love between us , lass .


MAGGIE .
I 've got the love all right .


WILLIE .
Well , I 've not , and that 's honest .


MAGGIE .
We 'll get along without .


WILLIE .
You 're desperate set on this .
It 's a puzzle to me all ways .
What ` ud your father say ?


MAGGIE .
He 'll say a lot , and he can say it .
It 'll make no difference to me .


WILLIE .
Much better not upset him .
It 's not worth while .


MAGGIE .
I 'm judge of that .
You 're going to wed me , Will .


WILLIE .
Oh , nay , I 'm not .
Really I ca n't do that , Maggie .
I can see that I 'm disturbing your arrangements like , but I 'll be obliged if you 'll put this notion from you .


MAGGIE .
When I make arrangements , my lad , they 're not made for upsetting .


WILLIE .
What makes it so desperate awkward is that I 'm tokened .


MAGGIE .
You 're what ?


WILLIE .
I 'm tokened to Ada Figgins .


MAGGIE .
Then you 'll get loose and quick .
Who 's Ada Figgins ?
Do I know her ?
( Moves L. and turns . )


WILLIE .
I 'm the lodger at her mother 's .


MAGGIE .
The scheming hussy .
It 's not that sandy gill who brings your dinner ?
( Moves C. )


WILLIE .
She 's golden-haired is Ada .
Aye , she 'll be here soon .


MAGGIE .
And so shall I. I 'll talk to Ada .
I 've seen her and I know the breed .
Ada 's the helpless sort .
( Turns L. )


WILLIE .
She needs protecting .


MAGGIE .
That 's how she got you , was it ?
( Turns C. ) Yes , I can see her clinging round your neck until you fancied you were strong .
But I 'll tell you this , my lad , it 's a desperate poor kind of a woman that 'll look for protection to the likes of you .


WILLIE .
Ada does .


MAGGIE .
And that gives me the weight of her .
She 's born to meekness , Ada is .
You wed her , and you 'll be an eighteen shilling a week bootmaker all the days of your life .
You 'll be a slave , and a contented slave .


WILLIE .
I 'm not ambitious that I know of .


MAGGIE .
No .
But you 're going to be .
I 'll see to that .
I 've got my work cut out , but there 's the makings of a man about you .


WILLIE .
I wish you 'd leave me alone .
( Sits R. )


MAGGIE .
So does the fly when the spider catches him .
You 're my man , Willie Mossop .
( Moves to desk . )


WILLIE .
Aye , so you say .
Ada would tell another story , though .


( ADA FIGGINS enters from street .
She is not ridiculous , but a weak , poor-blooded , poor-spirited girl of twenty , in clogs and shawl , with WILLIE 'S dinner in a basin carried in a blue handkerchief .
She crosses to him and gives him the basin . )


ADA ( C. ) .
There 's your dinner , Will .


WILLIE .
Thank you , Ada .
( Rises . )


( She turns to go , and finds MAGGIE in her way . )


MAGGIE .
I want a word with you .
You 're treading on my foot , young woman .


ADA .
Me , Miss Hobson ?
( She looks stupidly at MAGGIE 'S feet . )


MAGGIE .
What 's this with you and him ?


ADA ( gushing ) .
Oh , Miss ` Obson , it is good of you to take notice like that .


WILLIE .
Ada , she -


MAGGIE .
You hold your hush .
This is for me and her to settle .
Take a fair look at him , Ada .
ADA .
At Will ?


MAGGIE ( nodding ) .
Not much for two women to fall out over , is there ?


ADA .
Maybe he 's not so much to look at , but you should hear him play .


MAGGIE .
Play ?
Are you a musician , Will ?


WILLIE .
I play the Jew 's harp .


MAGGIE .
That 's what you see in him , is it ?
A gawky fellow that plays the Jew 's harp ?


ADA .
I see the lad I love , Miss ` Obson .


MAGGIE .
It 's a funny thing , but I can say the same .


ADA .
You !


WILLIE .
That 's what I 've been trying to tell you , Ada , and - and , by gum , she 'll have me from you if you do n't be careful .


MAGGIE .
So we 're quits so far , Ada .


ADA .
You 'll pardon me .
You 've spoke too late .
Will and me 's tokened .
( She takes his arm . )


MAGGIE .
That 's the past .
It 's the future that I 'm looking to .
What 's your idea for that ?
ADA .
You mind your own business , Miss ` Obson .
Will Mossop 's no concern of thine .


WILLIE .
That 's what I try to tell her myself , only she will have it it 's no use .


MAGGIE .
Not an atom .
I 've asked for your idea of Willie 's future .
If it 's a likelier one than mine , I 'll give you best and you can have the lad .


ADA .
I 'm trusting him to make the future right .


MAGGIE .
It 's as bad as I thought it was .
Willie , you wed me .


ADA ( weakly ) .
It 's daylight robbery .
( Moves slightly L. )


WILLIE .
Are n't you going to put up a better fight for me than that , Ada ?
You 're fair giving me to her .


MAGGIE .
Will Mossop , you take your orders from me in this shop .
I 've told you you 'll wed me .
WILLIE .
Seems like there 's no escape .
( Sits in arm-chair . )


ADA ( angry ) .
Wait while I get you to home , my lad .
I 'll set my mother on to you .


MAGGIE .
Oh , so it 's her mother made this match !


WILLIE .
She had above a bit to do with it .


MAGGIE .
I 've got no mother , Will .


WILLIE .
You need none , neither .


MAGGIE .
Well , can I sell you a pair of clogs , Miss Figgins ?


ADA .
No .
Nor anything else .


MAGGIE .
Then you 've no business here , have you ?
( Moves up to doors and opens them . )


ADA ( going to him ) .
Will , are you going to see me ordered out ?


WILLIE .
It 's her shop , Ada .


ADA .
You mean I 'm to go like this ?


WILLIE .
She means it .


ADA .
It 's cruel hard .
( Moves towards doors . )


MAGGIE .
When it comes to a parting , it 's best to part sudden and no whimpering about it .


ADA .
I 'm not whimpering , and I 'm not parting , neither .
But he 'll whimper to-night when my mother sets about him .
( Slight movement back to him . )


MAGGIE .
That 'll do .


ADA ( in almost a scream ) .
Will Mossop , I 'm telling you , you 'll come home to-night to a thick ear .


( She goes . )


WILLIE ( rising ) .
I 'd really rather wed Ada , Maggie , if it 's all same to you .


MAGGIE .
Why ?
Because of her mother ?


WILLIE .
She 's a terrible rough side to her tongue , has Mrs. Figgins .
MAGGIE .
Are you afraid of her ?


WILLIE ( hesitates , then says ) .
Yes .


MAGGIE .
You need n't be .


WILLIE .
Yes , but you do n't know her .
She 'll jaw me till I 'm black in the face when I go home to-night .


MAGGIE .
You wo n't go home to-night .


WILLIE .
Not go ?


MAGGIE .
You 've done with lodging there .
You 'll go to Tubby Wadlow 's when you knock off work and Tubby 'll go round to Mrs. Figgins for your things .
WILLIE .
And I 'm not to go back there never no more ?


MAGGIE .
No .


WILLIE .
It 's like an ` appy dream .
Eh , Maggie , you do manage things .


( He opens the trap . )


MAGGIE .
And while Tubby 's there you can go round and see about putting the banns up for us two .


WILLIE .
Banns !
Oh , but I 'm hardly used to the idea yet .
( A step down . )


MAGGIE .
You 'll have three weeks to get used to it in .
Now you can kiss me , Will .


WILLIE .
That 's forcing things a bit , and all .
It 's like saying I agree to everything , a kiss is .


MAGGIE .
Yes .


WILLIE .
And I do n't agree yet .
I 'm -


MAGGIE .
Come along .


( ALICE , then VICKEY enter R. )


Do what I tell you , Will .


WILLIE .
Now ?
With them here ?


MAGGIE .
Yes .


WILLIE ( pause ) .
I could n't .
( He dives for trap , runs down , and closes it . )


ALICE .
What 's the matter with Willie ?


MAGGIE .
He 's a bit upset because I 've told him he 's to marry me .
Is dinner cooking nicely ?
( To desk , L. ) ALICE .
You 're going to marry Willie Mossop !
Willie Mossop !


VICKEY .
You 've kept it quiet , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
You know about it pretty near as soon as Willie does himself .


VICKEY .
Well , I do n't know !


ALICE .
I know , and if you 're afraid to speak your thoughts , I 'm not .
Look here , Maggie - ( moving to L. C. ) , - what you do touches us , and you 're mistaken if you think I 'll own Willie Mossop for my brother-in-law .


MAGGIE .
Is there supposed to be some disgrace in him ?


ALICE .
You ask father if there 's disgrace .
And look at me .
I 'd hopes of Albert Prosser till this happened .


MAGGIE .
You 'll marry Albert Prosser when he 's able , and that 'll be when ho starts spending less on laundry bills and hair cream .
( Goes to R. )


( HOBSON enters from the street . )


HOBSON .
Well , what about that dinner ?
( Comes C. )


( The positions are MAGGIE R. , VICKEY up R. C. , HOBSON up C. , ALICE L. C. ) MAGGIE .
It 'll be ready in ten minutes .


HOBSON .
You said one o'clock .


MAGGIE .
Yes , father .
One for half-past .
If you 'll wash your hands , it 'll be ready as soon as you are .


HOBSON .
I wo n't wash my hands .
I do n't hold with such finicking ways , and well you know it .
( Sits in front of counter . )


VICKEY .
Father , have you heard the news about our Maggie ?
( Down R. C. )


HOBSON .
News ?
There is no news .
It 's the same old tale .
Uppishness .
You 'd keep a starving man from the meat he earns in the sweat of his brow , would you ?
I 'll put you in your places .
I 'll - ( Rises . )
MAGGIE .
Do n't lose your temper , father .
You 'll maybe need it soon when Vickey speaks .
( Moves down R. )


HOBSON .
What 's Vickey been doing ?


VICKEY .
Nothing .
It 's about Will Mossop , father .


HOBSON .
Will ?


ALICE .
Yes .
What 's your opinion of Will ?


HOBSON .
A decent lad .
I 've nowt against him that I know of .


ALICE .
Would you like him in the family ?


HOBSON .
Whose family ?
( Coming down C. )


VICKEY .
Yours .


MAGGIE .
I 'm going to marry Willie , father .
That 's what all the fuss is about .


HOBSON .
Marry - you - Mossop ?
( Moves to her . )


MAGGIE .
You thought me past the marrying age .
I 'm not .
That 's all .


HOBSON .
Did n't you hear me say I 'd do the choosing when it came to a question of husbands ?


MAGGIE .
You said I was too old to get a husband .


HOBSON .
You are .
You all are .


VICKEY .
Father !


HOBSON .
( crossing to C. ) And if you 're not , it makes no matter .
I 'll have no husbands here .


( VICKEY R. , ALICE L. of HOBSON . )


ALICE .
But you said -


HOBSON .
I 've changed my mind .
I 've learnt some things since then .
There 's a lot too much expected of a father nowadays .
There 'll be no weddings here .


ALICE .
Oh , father !


HOBSON ( taking them down ) .
Go and get my dinner served and talk less .
Go on now .
I 'm not in right temper to be crossed .


( He drives ALICE and VICKEY before him .
They go out protesting loudly .
But MAGGIE stands in his way as he follows and she closes the door .
She looks at him from the stair . )


MAGGIE .
You and I ` ull be straight with one another , father .
I 'm not a fool and you 're not a fool , and things may as well be put in their places as left untidy .


HOBSON .
I tell you my mind 's made up .
You ca n't have Willie Mossop .
Why , lass , his father was a workhouse brat .
A come-by - chance .
( Moves C. )


MAGGIE .
It 's news to me we 're snobs in Salford .
I have Willie Mossop .
I 've to settle my life 's course , and a good course , too , so think on .


HOBSON .
I 'd be the laughing-stock of the place if I allowed it .
I wo n't have it , Maggie .
It 's hardly decent at your time of life .


MAGGIE .
I 'm thirty and I 'm marrying Willie Mossop .
And now I 'll tell you my terms .


HOBSON .
You 're in a nice position to state terms , my lass .


MAGGIE .
You will pay my man , Will Mossop , the same wages as before .
And as for me , I 've given you the better part of twenty years of work without wages .
I 'll work eight hours a day in future and you will pay me fifteen shillings by the week .


HOBSON .
Do you think I 'm made of brass ?


MAGGIE .
You 'll soon be made of less than you are if you let Willie go .
And if Willie goes , I go .
That 's what you 've got to face .


HOBSON .
I might face it , Maggie .
Shop hands are cheap .


MAGGIE .
Cheap ones are cheap .
The sort you 'd have to watch all day , and you 'd feel happy helping them to tie up parcels and sell laces with Tudsbury and Heeler and Minns supping their ale without you .
I 'm value to you , so 's my man  and you can boast it at the `` Moonraker 's '' that your daughter Maggie 's made the strangest , finest match a woman 's made this fifty year .
And you can put your hand in your pocket and do what I propose .


HOBSON .
I 'll show you what I propose , Maggie .
( He lifts trap and calls . )
Will Mossop !
( He places hat on counter and unbuckles belt . )
I can not leather you , my lass .
You 're female , and exempt , but I can leather him .
Come up , Will Mossop .


( WILL comes up trap and closes it . )


You 've taken up with my Maggie , I hear .
( He conceals strap . )


WILLIE .
Nay , I 've not .
She 's done the taking up .


HOBSON .
Well , Willie , either way , you 've fallen on misfortune .
Love 's led you astray , and I feel bound to put you right .
( Shows strap . )


WILLIE .
Maggie , what 's this ?
( Moves down R. a little . )


MAGGIE .
I 'm watching you , my lad .


HOBSON .
Mind , Willie , you can keep your job .
I do n't bear malice , but we must beat the love from your body , and every morning you come here to work with love still sitting in you , you 'll get a leathering .
( Getting ready to strike . )


WILLIE .
You 'll not beat love in me .
You 're making a great mistake , Mr. Hobson , and -


HOBSON .
You 'll put aside your weakness for my Maggie if you 've a liking for a sound skin .
You 'll waste a gradely lot of brass at chemist 's if I am at you for a week with this .
( He swings the strap . )


WILLIE .
I 'm none wanting thy Maggie , it 's her that 's after me , but I 'll tell you this , Mr. Hobson - ( seizing MAGGIE roughly by the arm ) , - if you touch me with that belt , I 'll take her quick , aye , and stick to her like glue .


HOBSON .
There 's nobbut one answer to that kind of talk , my lad .
( He strikes with belt .
MAGGIE shrinks . )


WILLIE .
And I 've nobbut one answer back .
Maggie , I 've none kissed you yet .
I shirked before .
But , by gum , I 'll kiss you now - ( he kisses her quickly , with temper , not with passion , as quickly leaves her , to face HOBSON ) - and take you and hold you .
And if Mr. Hobson raises up that strap again , I 'll do more .
I 'll walk straight out of shop with thee and us two ` ull set up for ourselves .


MAGGIE .
Willie !
I knew you had it in you , lad .
( She puts her arm round his neck .
He is quite unresponsive .
His hands fall limply to his sides . )


( HOBSON stands in amazed indecision . )


CURTAIN .


ACT II


A month later .
The shop as Act I .
It is about mid-day .
ALICE is in MAGGIE 'S chair at the desk , some ledgers in front of her , and VICKEY is reading behind the counter .
The trap is open and TUBBY stands near the desk by ALICE .


ALICE .
I 'm sure I do n't know what to tell you to do , Tubby .


TUBBY .
There 's nothing in at all to start on , Miss Alice .
We 're worked up .


ALICE .
Well , father 's out and I ca n't help you .


TUBBY .
He 'll play old Harry if he comes in and finds us doing nowt in the workroom .


VICKEY .
Then do something .
We 're not stopping you .
( Rises and moves over to R. )


TUBBY ( turning on her ) .
You 're not telling me neither .
And I 'm supposed to take my orders from the shop .
ALICE .
I do n't know what to tell you .
Nobody seems to want any boots made .


TUBBY .
The high-class trade has dropped like a stone this last month .
Of course we can go on making clogs for stock if you like .


ALICE .
Then you 'd better .


TUBBY .
You know what 's got by selling clogs wo n't pay the rent , let alone wages , but if clogs are your orders , Miss Alice - ( He moves towards trap . )


ALICE .
You suggested it .


TUBBY .
I made the remark .
( Starts going down . )
But I 'm not a rash man , and I 'm not going to be responsible to the master with his temper so nowty and all since Miss Maggie went .


ALICE .
Oh , dear !
What would Miss Maggie have told you to do ?


TUBBY .
I could n't tell you that , Miss , I 'm sure .
I do n't recollect things being as slack as this in her time .


VICKEY .
You do n't help us much for an intelligent foreman .


TUBBY .
When you 've told me what to do , I 'll use my intelligence and see it 's done properly .


ALICE .
Then go and make clogs .


TUBBY .
Them 's your orders ?


ALICE .
Yes .


TUBBY .
Thank you , Miss Alice .


( TUBBY goes down trap and closes it . )


ALICE ( rises and moves up L. ) .
I wonder if I 've done right ?


VICKEY .
That 's your look-out .


ALICE .
I do n't care .
It 's father 's place to be here to tell them what to do .


VICKEY .
Maggie used to manage without him .


ALICE .
Oh , yes .
Go on .
Blame me that the place is all at sixes and sevens .
( Coming down to desk . )


VICKEY .
I do n't blame you .
I know as well as you do that it 's father 's fault .
He ought to look after his business himself instead of wasting more time than ever in the `` Moonraker 's , '' but you need n't be snappy with me about it .


ALICE .
I 'm not snappy in myself .
( Sitting at desk . )
It 's these figures .
I ca n't get them right .
What 's 17 and 25 ?


VICKEY ( promptly ) .
Fifty-two , of course .


ALICE .
Well , it does n't balance right .
Oh , I wish I was married and out of it .
( Closes book . )


VICKEY .
Same here .


ALICE .
You !
( Rises . )


VICKEY .
You need n't think you 're the only one .


ALICE .
Well , you 're sly , Vickey Hobson .
You 've kept it to yourself .


VICKEY .
It 's just as well now that I did .
Maggie 's spoilt our chances for ever .
Nobody 's fretting to get Willie Mossop for a brother-in-law .


( MAGGIE enters , followed by FREDDY BEENSTOCK and then WILL .
MAGGIE and WILL are actually about to be married , but their dress does not specially indicate it .
They are not in their older clothes , and that is all .
FREDDY is smarter than either , though only in his everyday dress .
He is not at all a blood , but the respectable son of a respectable tradesman , and his appearance is such as to justify his attractiveness in VICKEY 'S eyes .
WILL , very shy , remains up L. C. near the counter . )


ALICE .
Maggie , you here !


MAGGIE .
I thought we 'd just drop in .
Vickey , what 's this that Mr. Beenstock 's telling me about you and him ?
VICKEY ( sullenly ) .
If he 's told you I suppose you know .


FREDDY ( L. of counter , smilingly ) .
She got it out of me , Vickey .
VICKEY .
I do n't know that it 's any business of yours , Maggie .


( The positions now are VICKEY R. , MAGGIE R. C. , FREDDY C. , WILL up L. C. , ALICE down L. C. )


MAGGIE .
You 'll never get no farther with it by yourselves from what I hear of father 's carryings-on .


VICKEY .
That 's your fault .
Yours and his .
( Moving behind counter and indicating WILLIE , who is trying to efface himself at the back . )


MAGGIE ( sharply ) .
Leave that alone .
I 'm here to help you if you 'll have my help .


( VICKEY would say `` No '' but - )


FREDDY .
It 's very good of you , Miss Maggie , I must say .
Your father has turned very awkward .


MAGGIE .
I reckon he 'll change .
Has your young man been in yet this morning , Alice ?
( Moves to desk . )


( FREDDY moves to VICKEY and leaning across the counter carries on a mild flirtation with her . )


ALICE ( indignantly ) .
My young -


MAGGIE .
Albert Prosser .


ALICE .
No .


MAGGIE .
Do you expect him ?


ALICE .
He 's not been here so often since you and Willie Mossop got -


MAGGIE ( sharply ) .
Since when ?


ALICE .
Since you made him buy that pair of boots he did n't want .


MAGGIE ( moving C. ) .
I see .
He did n't like paying for taking his pleasure in our shop .
Well , if he 's not expected , somebody must go for him .
Prosser , Pilkington  Prosser , Solicitors of Bexley Square .
That 's right , is n't it ?


ALICE .
Yes .
Albert 's `` and Prosser . ''


MAGGIE ( moving up stage R. ) .
Aye ?
Quite a big man in his way .
Then , will you go and fetch him , Mr. Beenstock ?
Tell him to bring the paper with him .


VICKEY ( dropping down R. , indignantly ) .
You 're ordering folk about a bit .


MAGGIE .
I 'm used to it .


FREDDY .
It 's all right , Vickey .


ALICE .
Is it ?
Suppose father comes in and finds Albert and Freddy here ?


MAGGIE .
He wo n't .


ALICE .
He 's beyond his time already .


MAGGIE .
I know .
You must have worried father very badly since I went , Alice .
( Goes to ALICE , L. )


ALICE .
Why ?


MAGGIE .
Tell them , Mr. Beenstock .


FREDDY .
Well , the fact is , Mr. Hobson wo n't come because he 's at our place just now .


VICKEY .
At your corn warehouse ?
What 's father doing there ?


FREDDY .
He 's - he 's sleeping , Vickey .


ALICE .
Sleeping ?


( WILLIE sits on a chair in front of the counter . )


FREDDY .
You see , we 've a cellar trap in our place that opens in the pavement and your father - was n't looking very carefully where he was going and he fell into it .


VICKEY .
Fell ?
Is father hurt ?
( Up to FREDDY . )


FREDDY .
He 's snoring very loudly , but he is n't hurt .
He fell soft on some bags .


MAGGIE .
Now you can go for Albert Prosser .


( FREDDY moves to doors .
L. )


ALICE .
Is that all we 're to be told ?


MAGGIE .
It 's all there is to tell till Freddy 's seen his solicitor .


FREDDY ( to VICKEY ) .
I 'll not be long .


MAGGIE .
Do n't .
I 've a job here for you when you get back .


( FREDDY goes out L. )


ALICE .
I do n't know what you 're aiming at , Maggie , but -


MAGGIE .
The difference between us is that I do .
I always did .
( Goes L. )


VICKEY ( indicating WILLIE ) .
It 's a queer thing you aimed at .
( Moves up to behind counter . )


MAGGIE ( moving up to WILL ) .
I 've done uncommon well myself , and I 've come here to put things straight for you .
Father told you to get married and you do n't shape .


ALICE .
He changed his mind .


MAGGIE .
I do n't allow for folks to change their minds .
He made his choice .
He said get married , and you 're going to .


VICKEY .
You have n't made it easier for us , you know .


MAGGIE .
Meaning Willie ?


WILLIE .
It was n't my fault , Miss Vickey , really it was n't .


MAGGIE .
You call her Vickey , Will .


VICKEY .
No , he does n't .
( Drops down stage R. )


MAGGIE .
He 's in the family or going to be .
And I 'll tell you this .
If you want your Freddy , and if you want your Albert , you 'll be respectful to my Willie .


ALICE .
Willie Mossop was our boot hand .


MAGGIE .
He was , and you 'll let bygones be bygones .
He 's as good as you are now , and better .


WILLIE .
Nay , come , Maggie -


MAGGIE .
Better , I say .
They 're shop assistants .
You 're your own master , are n't you ?


WILLIE .
I 've got my name wrote up on the windows , but I dunno so much about being master .


MAGGIE ( producing card and moving down L. to ALICE ) .
That 's his business card , William Mossop , Practical Boot and Shoe Maker , 39a , Oldfield Road , Salford .
William Mossop , Master Bootmaker !
That 's the man you 're privileged to call by his Christian name .
Aye , and I 'll do more for you than let you call him in his name .
Yon can both of you kiss him for your brother - in-law to be .


WILLIE ( rising ) .
Nay , Maggie , I 'm no great hand at kissing .


( VICKEY and ALICE are much annoyed . )


MAGGIE ( dryly ) .
I 've noticed that .
A bit of practice will do you no harm .
Come along , Vickey .


ALICE ( interposing ) .
But , Maggie - a shop of your own -


MAGGIE ( grimly ) .
I 'm waiting , Vickey .


WILLIE .
I do n't see that you ought to drive her to it , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
You hold your hush .
( Crosses R. to VICKEY . )


ALICE .
But however did you manage it ?
Where did the capital come from ?


MAGGIE .
It came .
Will , stand still .
She 's making up her mind to it .


WILLIE .
I 'd just as lief not put her to the trouble .


MAGGIE .
You 'll take your proper place in this family , my lad , trouble or no trouble .


VICKEY .
I do n't see why you should always get your way .


MAGGIE .
It 's just a habit .
Come along now , Vickey , I 've a lot to do to-day and you 're holding everything back .


VICKEY .
It 's under protest .


MAGGIE .
Protest , but kiss .


( VICKEY goes to and kisses WILL , who finds he rather likes it .
She moves back R. , then goes up to case up R. and starts dusting furiously . )


Your turn now , Alice .


ALICE .
I 'll do it if you 'll help me with these books , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
Books ?
Father 's put you in my place ?
( Goes L. C. )


ALICE .
Yes .


MAGGIE .
Then he must take the consequences .
Your books are n't my affair .


ALICE .
I think you might help me , Maggie .


( VICKEY glances back at WILL . )


MAGGIE .
I 'm surprised at you , Alice , I really am , after what you 've just been told .
Exposing your books to a rival shop .
You ought to know better .
Will 's waiting .
And you 're to kiss him hearty now .


ALICE .
Very well .
( She moves C. and kisses WILL , then goes back L. )


WILLIE .
There 's more in kissing nice young women than I thought .


MAGGIE .
Do n't get too fond of it , my lad .
( She goes to him . )


ALICE .
Well , I hope you 're satisfied , Maggie .
You 've got your way again , and now perhaps you 'll tell us if there 's anything you want in this shop .


MAGGIE .
Eh ?
Are you trying to sell me something ?


ALICE .
I 'm asking you , what 's your business here ?


MAGGIE .
I 've told you once .
Will and me 's taking a day off to put you in the way of getting wed. .


VICKEY ( moving to back of counter ) .
It looks like things are slow at your new shop if you can walk round in your best clothes on a working day .


WILLIE .
It 's not a working day with us .
It 's a wedding-day .


ALICE .
You 've been married this morning !


MAGGIE .
Not us .
( Goes to R. ) I 'll have my sisters there when I get wed. .
It 's at one o'clock at St. Philip 's .
( Sits R. ) VICKEY .
But we ca n't leave the shop to come .


MAGGIE .
Why not ?
Is trade so brisk ?


VICKEY .
No , but -


( WILLIE sits in front of counter . )


MAGGIE .
Not so much high-class trade doing with you , eh ?


ALICE .
I do n't see how you knew .


MAGGIE .
I 'm good at guessing .
You 'll not miss owt by coming with us to church , and we 'll expect you at home to-night for a wedding-spread .


VICKEY .
It 's asking us to approve .


MAGGIE .
You have approved .
You 've kissed the bridegroom and you 'll go along with us .
Father 's safe where he is .
( Rises and crosses L. )


ALICE .
And the shop ?


MAGGIE .
Tubby can see to the shop .
And that reminds me .
You can sell me something .
There are some rings in that drawer there , Vickey .


VICKEY .
Brass rings ?


MAGGIE .
Yes .
I want one .
That 's the size .
( She holds up her wedding-ring finger and moves to the counter . )


VICKEY .
That !
But you 're not taking it for -


( VICKEY puts box of rings on counter . )


MAGGIE .
Yes , I am .
Will and me are n't throwing money round , but we can pay our way .
There 's fourpence for the ring .
Gather it up , Vickey .
( Putting down money and trying on rings . )


ALICE .
Wedded with a brass ring !


MAGGIE .
This one will do .
It 's a nice fit .
Alice , you have n't entered that sale in your book .
No wonder you 're worried with the accounts if that 's the way you see to them .
( She comes down L. C. and puts ring in her bag . )


ALICE .
I 'm a bit too much astonished at you to think about accounts .
A ring out of stock !


MAGGIE .
They 're always out of some one 's stock .


VICKEY .
Well , I 'd think shame to myself to be married with a ring like that .


MAGGIE .
When folks ca n't afford the best they have to do without .


VICKEY .
I 'll take good care I never go without .


MAGGIE .
Semi-detached for you , I suppose , and a houseful of new furniture .


ALICE .
Have n't you furnished ?


MAGGIE .
Partly what .
We 've made a start at the Flat Iron Market .
( Sits L. of WILLIE . )


ALICE .
I 'd stay single sooner than have other people 's cast-off sticks in my house .
Where 's your pride gone to , Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
I 'm not getting wed myself to help the furnishing trade along .
I suppose you 'd turn your nose up at second-hand stuff , too , Vickey ?


VICKEY .
I 'd start properly or not at all .
( Goes to desk , L. ) MAGGIE .
Then you 'll neither of you have any objections to my clearing out the lumber-room upstairs .
( Rises . )
We brought a hand-cart round with us .
( Nudges WILL . )


( WILL rises and takes his coat off .
He has detachable cuffs which he places carefully on the arm-chair . )


VICKEY .
You made sure of things .


MAGGIE .
Yes .
Get upstairs , Will .
I told you what to bring .


ALICE .
Wait a bit .
( Crosses to C. )


MAGGIE .
Go on .
( Moves R. slightly . )


( WILL goes into the house . )


ALICE .
Let me tell you if you claim the furniture from your old bedroom - ( up to MAGGIE ) , - that it 's my room now , and you 'll not budge a stick of it .


MAGGIE .
I expected you 'd promote yourself , Alice .
But I said lumber-room .
There 's a two-three broken chairs in the attic and a sofa with the springs all gone .
You 'll not tell me they 're of any use to you .


ALICE .
Nor to you , neither .


MAGGIE .
Will 's handy with his fingers .
He 'll put in this afternoon mending them .
They 'll be secure against you come to sit on them at supper-time to-night .


VICKEY .
And that 's the way you 're going to live !
With cast-off furniture .
( Moves to window , L. )


MAGGIE .
Aye .
In two cellars in Oldfield Road .


VICKEY and ALICE .
A cellar !


MAGGIE .
Two of 'em , Alice .
One to live and work in and the other to sleep in .


ALICE .
Well , it ` ud not suit me .


VICKEY .
Nor me .


MAGGIE .
It suits me fine .
And when me and Will are richer than the lot of you together , it 'll be a grand satisfaction to look back and think about how we were when we began .


( WILL appears R. with two crippled chairs and begins to cross the shop . )


VICKEY ( stopping him ) .
Just a minute , Will .
( She examines the chairs . )
These chairs are not so bad .


MAGGIE .
You can sit on one to-night and see .


VICKEY .
You know , mended up , those chairs would do very well for my kitchen when I 'm wed. .


ALICE .
Yes , or for mine .


MAGGIE .
I reckon my parlour comes afront of your kitchens , though .


VICKEY .
Parlour !
I thought you said you 'd only one living-room .


MAGGIE .
Then it might as well be called a parlour as by any other name .
( Crosses to doors , L. , and opens them . )
Put the chairs on the hand-cart , Will .


( WILL goes out to street . )


And as for your kitchens , you 've got none yet , and if you want my plan for you to work , you 'll just remember all I 'm taking off you is some crippled stuff that is n't yours and what I 'm getting for you is marriage portions .


ALICE .
What ?
( Moves to C. )


VICKEY .
Marriage portions , Maggie !


( FREDDY re-enters , accompanied by ALBERT . )


MAGGIE ( to VICKEY and ALICE ) .
You 'd better put your hats on now , or you 'll be late at the church .
( Gets between ALICE and VICKEY , C. )


VICKEY .
But are n't we to know first - ?


MAGGIE ( herding them to R. exit ) .
You 'll know all right .
Be quick with your things now .
( ALICE and VICKEY go out R. )


MAGGIE ( turns ) .
Good morning , Albert .
( Goes to him , L. ) Have you got what Freddy asked you for ?
ALBERT .
Yes , but I 'm afraid -


( WILL re-enters from street , crosses R. and goes off . )


MAGGIE .
Never mind being afraid .
Freddy , I told you I 'd a job here for you .
You go upstairs with Will .
There 's a sofa to come down .
Get your coat off to it .
Now , then , Albert .


FREDDY .
But - ( Moving over to R. )


MAGGIE .
I 've told you what to do , and you ca n't do it in your coat .
( Moves down L. ) If that sofa is n't here in two minutes , I 'll leave the lot of you to tackle this yourselves and a nice hash you 'll make of it .


( FREDDY takes his coat off and puts it on a chair in front of the counter . )


FREDDY .
All right , Maggie .


( FREDDY goes out R. , ALBERT produces blue paper .
She reads . )


MAGGIE ( sitting in arm-chair , R. C. ) .
Do you call this English ?
ALBERT ( standing L. of her ) .
Legal English , Miss Hobson .
MAGGIE .
I thought it were n't the sort we talk in Lancashire .
What is it when you 've got behind the whereases and the saids and to wits ?


ALBERT .
It 's what you told Freddy to instruct me .
Action against Henry Horatio Hobson for trespass on the premises of Jonathan Beenstock c.. , Corn Merchants , of Chapel Street , Salford , with damages to certain corn bags caused by falling on them and further damages claimed for spying on the trade secrets of the aforesaid J. B. c.. .


MAGGIE .
Well , I 'll take your word that this means that - I should n't have thought it , but I suppose lawyers are like doctors .
They 've each a secret language , of their own so that if you get a letter from one lawyer you 've to take it to another to get it read , just like a doctor sends you to a chemist with a rigmarole that no one else can read , so they can charge you what they like for a drop of coloured water .


ALBERT .
I 've made this out to your instructions , Miss Hobson , but I 'm far from saying it 's good law , and I 'd not be keen on going into court with it .


MAGGIE .
Nobody asked you to .
It wo n't come into court .


( WILL and FREDDY enter C. with a ramshackle horsehair sofa . )


( Rises . )
Open that door for them , Albert .


( ALBERT opens street door .
They pass out . )


What 's the time ?
You can see the clock from there .


ALBERT ( outside street door ) .
It 's a quarter to one .


MAGGIE ( flying to R. door , opening it , and calling ) .
Girls , if you 're late for my wedding I 'll never forgive you .
( She turns as WILL and FREDDY return . )


Put your coats on .
Now , then , Freddy - ( going C. ) , - you take that paper and put it on my father in your cellar .


FREDDY .
Now ?


MAGGIE .
Now ?
Yes , of course now .
He might waken any time .


FREDDY .
He looked fast enough .
Are n't I to come to the church ?


MAGGIE .
Yes , if you do that quick enough to get there before we 're through .


FREDDY .
All right .
( He goes out L. , pocketing the paper .
MAGGIE follows him to the door . )


MAGGIE .
Now there 's that hand-cart .
Are we to take it with us ?


ALBERT .
To church !
You ca n't do that .


WILLIE .
I 'll take it home .
( Slight move . )


MAGGIE .
And have me waiting for you at the church ?
That 's not for me , my lad .


ALBERT .
You ca n't very well leave it where it is .


MAGGIE .
No .
There 's only one thing for it .
You 'll have to take it to our place , Albert .


ALBERT .
Me !


MAGGIE .
There 's the key .
( Down to ALBERT , L. , and hands it from her bag . )
It 's 39a , Oldfield Road .


ALBERT .
Yes , but to push a hand-cart through Salford in broad daylight !


MAGGIE .
It wo n't dirty your collar .


ALBERT .
Suppose some of my friends see me ?


( They both move up L. )


MAGGIE .
Look here , my lad , if you 're too proud to do a job like that , you 're not the husband for my sister .


ALBERT .
It 's the look of the thing .
Ca n't you send somebody from here ?


MAGGIE .
No .
You can think it over .
( She raises trap . )
Tubby !
TUBBY ( below ) .
Yes , Miss. ( He appears half-way up trap . )
Why , it 's Miss Maggie !
MAGGIE .
Come up , Tubby .
You 're in charge of the shop .
We 'll all be out for awhile .


TUBBY .
I 'll be up in half a minute , Miss Maggie .
( He goes down and closes trap . )


MAGGIE .
Well , Albert Prosser ?


ALBERT ( up L. ) .
I suppose I must .


MAGGIE .
That 's right .
We 'll call it your wedding gift to me , and I 'll allow you 're putting yourself out a bit for me .
( Going with him to the door .
He goes .
She turns and comes to C. )


Well , Will , you 've not had much to say for yourself to-day .
Howst feeling , lad ?


WILLIE .
I 'm going through with it , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
Eh ?


WILLIE .
My mind 's made up .
I 've got wrought up to point .
I 'm ready .


MAGGIE .
It 's church we 're going to , not the dentist 's .


WILLIE .
I know .
You get rid of summat at dentist 's , but it 's taking summat on to go to church with a wench , and the Lord knows what .


MAGGIE .
Sithee , Will , I 've a respect for church .
Yon 's not the place for lies .
The parson 's going to ask you will you have me and you 'll either answer truthfully or not at all .
If you 're not willing , just say so now , and -


WILLIE .
I 'll tell him `` yea '' .


MAGGIE .
And truthfully ?


WILLIE .
Yes , Maggie .
I 'm resigned .
You 're growing on me , lass .
I 'll toe the line with you .
( ALICE and VICKEY enter R. in their Sunday clothes - the same at which HOBSON grew indignant in Act I. MAGGIE takes WILLIE across to L. )


ALICE .
We 're ready , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
And time you were .
It 's not your weddings that you 're dressing for .
( By trap . )
Come up , Tubby , and keep an eye on things .


VICKEY .
( to WILL ) .
Will , have you got the ring ?


MAGGIE .
I have .
Do you think I 'd trust him to remember ?


( MAGGIE goes off with WILL .
VICKEY and ALICE are following , laughing .
TUBBY comes up trap and throws old shoes after them . )


CURTAIN .


[ Illustration ] Reddish brick walls .
Plaster falling off in places .
Very old square carpet .
Fire burning .
No ornaments .
Tin box on mantelpiece .
A few plates , workbasket and tin boxes on dresser .
Shoes , clogs on top of dresser .
Old coloured tablecloth on table .
Roll of leather , etc. , at table behind screen .

ACT III


The cellar in Oldfield Road is at once workroom , shop , and living-room .
It is entered from the R. corner by a door at the top of a flight of some seven stairs .
Its three windows are high up at the back - not shop windows , but simply to give light .
Each window has on it `` William Mossop , Practical Bootmaker , '' reversed as seen from the inside and is illuminated dimly from outside by a neighbouring street lamp .


A door L. leads to the bedroom .
Up stage L. is a small screen or partition whose purpose is to conceal the sink .
A shoemaker 's bench , leather and tackle are against the wall , R. , above the fire-place .
Below the door , L. , is a small dresser .
Table R. C. Seating accommodation consists solely of the sofa and the two chairs taken from HOBSON 'S , now repaired .
The sofa is L. of the table , the two chairs R. Crowded on the sofa are , in order , from down up , ALBERT , ALICE , VICKEY , FRED .


As the curtain rises , the four are standing , tea-cups in hand , saying together `` The Bride and Bridegroom . ''
They drink and sit .
General laughter and conversation .
On the chair down stage is MAGGIE .
From the other chair , C. , behind table , WILL rises , nervously , and rushes his little speech like a child who has learnt a lesson .
The table has hot-house flowers ( in a basin ) and the remains of a meal at which tea only has been drunk , and the feast is represented by the sections of a large pork pie and a small wedding cake .
As WILL rises , ALBERT hammers on the table .


ALICE suppresses him .
WILLIE .
It 's a very great pleasure to us to see you here to - night .
It 's an honour you do us , and I assure you , speaking for my - my wife , as well as for myself , that the - the -


MAGGIE ( in an undertone ) .
Generous .


WILLIE .
Oh , aye .
That 's it .
That the generous warmth of the sentiments so cordially expressed by Mr. Beenstock and so enthusiastically seconded by - no , I 've gotten that wrong road round - expressed by Mr. Prosser and seconded by Mr. Beenstock - will never be forgotten by either my life partner or self - and - and I 'd like to drink this toast to you in my own house .
Our guests , and may they all be married soon themselves .


MAGGIE ( rising and drinking with WILL ) .
Our guests .


( WILL and MAGGIE sit .
General laughter and conversation . )


ALBERT ( solemnly rising ) .
In rising to respond -


ALICE ( tugging his coat and putting him into his seat ) .
Sit down .
We 've had enough of speeches .
I know men fancy themselves when they 're talking , but you 've had one turn and you need n't start again .


ALBERT .
But we ought to thank him , Alice .


ALICE .
I dare say .
But you 'll not speak as well as he did , so we can leave it with a good wind-up .
I 'm free to own you took me by surprise , Will .


FREDDY .
Very neat speech indeed .
( Rising . )


VICKEY .
Who taught you , Will ?


WILLIE .
I 've been learning a lot lately .


ALICE .
I thought that speech never came natural from Will .


MAGGIE .
I 'm educating him .


FREDDY .
Very apt pupil , I must say .


MAGGIE .
He 'll do .
Another twenty years and I know which of you three men ` ull be thought most of at the Bank .


FREDDY .
That 's looking ahead a bit .


MAGGIE .
I 'll admit it needs imagination to see it now .


ALBERT ( rising and moving slightly C. ) .
Well , the start 's all right , you know .
Snug little rooms .
Shop of your own .
And so on .
I was wondering where you raised the capital for this , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
I ?
You must n't call it my shop .
It 's his .


ALICE .
Do you mean to tell me that Willie found the capital ?


MAGGIE .
He 's the saving sort .


ALICE .
He must be if you 've done this out of what father used to pay him .


MAGGIE .
Well , we have n't .
Not altogether .
We 've had help .


ALBERT .
Ah !


VICKEY .
It 's a mystery to me where you got it from .


MAGGIE .
Same place as those flowers , Albert .


ALBERT .
Hot-house flowers , I see .
( He rises and examines them . )
I was wondering where they came from .


( VICKEY and FREDDY smell flowers . )


MAGGIE .
Same place as the money , Albert .


ALBERT .
Ah !


ALICE ( rising and following him , C. ) .
Well , I think we ought to be getting home , Maggie .


MAGGIE ( rising , as do the rest .
VICKEY and FREDDY move up stage ) .
I should n't marvel .
I reckon Tubby 's a bit tired of looking after the shop by now , and if father 's wakened up and come in -


ALICE .
That 's it .
I 'm a bit nervous .


MAGGIE .
He 'll have an edge on his temper .
Come and put your hats on .


( She is going L. , with ALICE and VICKEY , then stops . )


Willie , we 'll need this table when they 're gone .
You 'd better be clearing the pots away .


WILLIE ( by table , R. ) Yes , Maggie .


( MAGGIE turns to L. )


FREDDY .
But - you -


ALBERT .
Oh , Lord !


( They laugh . )


MAGGIE ( quite calmly ) .
And you and Fred can just lend him a hand with the washing up , Albert .


FREDDY .
Me wash pots !


VICKEY ( really outraged ) .
Maggie , we 're guests .


MAGGIE .
I know .
Only Albert laughed at Willie , and washing up ` ull maybe make him think on that it 's not allowed .


( She ushers ALICE and VICKEY out , L. , and follows .
WILLIE begins to put pots on tray which he gets from behind screen , up L. )


ALBERT ( after he and FRED have looked at each other , then at WILL , then at each other again ) .
Are you going to wash up pots ?


FREDDY .
Are you ?


ALBERT .
I look at it like this myself .
All being well , you and I are marrying into this family and we know what Maggie is .
If we start giving in to her now , she 'll be a nuisance to us all our lives .


FREDDY .
That 's right enough , but there 's this plan of hers to get us married .
Are you prepared to work it for us ?


ALBERT .
I 'm not .
Anything but -


FREDDY .
Then till she 's done it we 're to keep the sweet side of Maggie .
ALBERT .
But , washing pots !
( Moves down L. )


( There is a pause .
They look at WILL , who has brought the tray from behind the screen and is now clearing up the table . )


FREDDY .
What would you do in our place , Will ?


WILLIE .
Please yourselves .
I 'm getting on with what she told me .


FREDDY .
You 're married to her .
We are n't .


ALBERT .
What do you need the table for in such a hurry ?


WILLIE  Nay , I 'm not in any hurry myself .


FREDDY .
Maggie wants it for something .


WILLIE .
It 'll be for my lessons , I reckon .
She 's schooling me .


FREDDY .
And do n't you want to learn , then ?


WILLIE ( moves C. ) .
'T is n't that .
I - just do n't want to be rude to you - turning you out so early .
I do n't see you need to go away so soon .
( Crosses below table . )


ALBERT .
Why not ?


WILLIE .
I 'm fond of a bit of company .


ALBERT .
Do you want company on your wedding night ?


WILLIE .
I do n't favour your going so soon .
( Crosses C. again . )


FREDDY .
He 's afraid to be alone with her .
That 's what it is .
He 's shy of his wife .


( They laugh . )


WILLIE .
That 's a fact .
I 've not been married before , you see .
I 've not been left alone with her , either .
Up to now she 's been coming round to where I lodged at Tubby Wadlow 's to give me my lessons .
It 's different now , and I freely own I 'm feeling awkward-like .
I 'd be deeply obliged if you would stay on a bit to help to - to thaw the ice for me .


FREDDY .
You 've been engaged to her , have n't you ?


WILLIE .
Aye , but it were n't for long .
And you see , Maggie 's not the sort you get familiar with .


FREDDY .
You had quite long enough to thaw the ice .
It 's not our job to do your melting for you .
( Moves away R. )


ALBERT .
No .
Fred , these pots need washing .
We will wash them .


( ALBERT carries tray behind screen .
Water runs .
He is seen flourishing towels .
FRED is following when WILLIE calls him back and takes tray to table . )


WILLIE .
Fred , would you like it yourself with - with a wench like Maggie ?
( Goes R. C. ) FREDDY .
That 's not the point .
It was n't me she married .


WILLIE .
It 's that being alone with her that worries me , and I did think you 'd stand by a fellow man to make things not so strange at first .


ALBERT ( coming down , with a dishcloth ) .
That 's not the way we look at it .
Hurry up with those cups , Fred .
( Goes to FRED up stage R. )


( MAGGIE enters with VICKEY and ALICE in outdoor clothes . )


MAGGIE .
Have you broken anything yet , Albert ?


ALBERT ( indignantly ) .
Broken ?
No .
( Takes cup from tray and wipes it . )


MAGGIE .
Too slow to , I expect .


FREDDY .
I must say you do n't show much gratitude .


ALBERT .
Are n't you at all surprised to find us doing this ?


MAGGIE .
Surprised ?
I told you to do it .


FREDDY .
Yes , but - ( Takes tray up stage , L. )


MAGGIE ( taking towel from him ) .
You can stop now .
I 'll finish when you 're gone .
( Moves down R. )


( Knock at door upstairs , R. )


ALICE .
Who 's that ?


MAGGIE .
Some one who ca n't read , I reckon .
You hung that card on door , Will ?


WILLIE .
Aye , it 's there .
And you wrote it , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
I knew better than to trust to you .
`` Business suspended for the day '' it says , and they that ca n't read it can go on knocking .


HOBSON ( off R. upstairs , after another knock ) .
Are you in , Maggie ?


VICKEY ( terrified ) .
It 's father !


( General consternation . )


ALBERT .
Oh , Lord !


MAGGIE .
What 's the matter ?
Are you afraid of him ?


FREDDY .
Well , I think , all things considered , and seeing -


MAGGIE .
All right .
We 'll consider 'em .
You can go into the bedroom , the lot of you - .
No , not you , Willie .
The rest .
I 'll shout when I want you .


ALICE .
When he 's gone .


MAGGIE .
It 'll be before he 's gone .


( MAGGIE crosses to L. with them . )


VICKEY .
But we do n't want -


MAGGIE .
Is this your house or mine ?


VICKEY .
It 's your cellar .


MAGGIE .
And I 'm in charge of it .


( The four go into bedroom .
VICKEY starts to argue .
ALBERT opens the door .
VICKEY and ALICE go out followed by FREDDY and ALBERT .
VICKEY is pushed inside .
WILL is going to stairs . )
You sit you still , and do n't forget you 're gaffer here .
I 'll open door .
( WILLIE sits in chair above table .
MAGGIE goes upstairs and opens the door .
Enter HOBSON to top stair . )


HOBSON ( with some slight apology ) .
Well , Maggie .


MAGGIE ( uninvitingly ) .
Well , father .


HOBSON ( without confidence ) .
I 'll come in .


MAGGIE ( standing in his way ) .
Well , I do n't know .
I 'll have to ask the master about that .


HOBSON .
Eh ?
The master ?


MAGGIE .
You and him did n't part on the best of terms , you know .
( Over the railings . )
Will , it 's my father .
Is he to come in ?


WILLIE ( loudly and boldly ) .
Aye , let him come .


( HOBSON comes downstairs .
MAGGIE closes door behind him and follows .
HOBSON stares round at the cellar . )


HOBSON .
You do n't sound cordial about your invitation , young man .


WILLIE ( rises and goes C. ) .
Nay , but I am .
( Shaking hands for a long time . )
I 'm right down glad to see you , Mr. Hobson .
( MAGGIE comes down R. ) It makes the wedding-day complete-like , you being her father and I - I hope you 'll see your way to staying a good long while .


HOBSON .
Well -


MAGGIE .
That 's enough , Will .
You do n't need to overdo it .
You can sit down for five minutes , father .
That sofa ` ull bear your weight .
It 's been tested .


( HOBSON sits on sofa , R. C. WILLIE goes back to the chair , R. )


WILLIE ( taking up teapot ) .
There 's nobbut tea to drink and I reckon what 's in the pot is stewed , so I 'll - MAGGIE ( taking pot off him as he moves to fire-place with it ) .
You 'll not do owt of sort .
Father likes his liquids strong .


WILLIE ( down R. of table ) .
A piece of pork pie now , Mr. Hobson ?
HOBSON ( groaning ) .
Pork pie !


MAGGIE ( sharply ) .
You 'll be sociable now you 're here , I hope .
( She pours tea at table , top end . )


HOBSON .
It was n't sociability that brought me , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
What was it , then ?


HOBSON .
Maggie , I 'm in disgrace .
A sore and sad misfortune 's fallen on me .


MAGGIE ( cutting ) .
Happen a piece of wedding cake ` ull do you good .


HOBSON ( shuddering ) .
It 's sweet .


MAGGIE .
That 's natural in cake .


( MAGGIE sits in chair above table . )


HOBSON .
I 've gotten such a head .


MAGGIE .
Aye .
But wedding cake 's a question of heart .
There'd be no bride cakes made at all if we thought first about our heads .
I 'm quite aware it 's foolishness , but I 've a wish to see my father sitting at my table eating my wedding cake on my wedding - day .


HOBSON .
It 's a very serious thing I came about , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
It 's not more serious than knowing that you wish us well .


HOBSON .
Well , Maggie , you know my way .
When a thing 's done it 's done .
You 've had your way and done what you wanted .
I 'm none proud of the choice you made and I 'll not lie and say I am , but I 've shaken your husband 's hand , and that 's a sign for you .
The milk 's spilt and I 'll not cry .


MAGGIE ( holding plate ) .
Then there 's your cake , and you can eat it .


HOBSON .
I 've given you my word there 's no ill feeling .
( Pushes cake away . )


MAGGIE .
So now we 'll have the deed .
( Pushes it back . )


HOBSON .
You 're a hard woman .
( He eats . )
You 've no consideration for the weakness of old age .


MAGGIE .
Finished ?


HOBSON .
Pass me that tea .


( She passes : he drinks . )


That 's easier .


MAGGIE .
Now tell me what it is you came about ?


HOBSON .
I 'm in sore trouble , Maggie .


MAGGIE ( rising and going towards door , L. ) .
Then I 'll leave you with my husband to talk it over .


HOBSON .
Eh ?


MAGGIE .
You 'll not be wanting me .
Women are only in your way .


HOBSON ( rising and going C. ) .
Maggie , you re not going to desert me in the hour of my need , are you ?


MAGGIE .
Surely to goodness you do n't want a woman to help you after all you 've said !
Will ` ull do his best , I make no doubt .
( She goes towards door . )
Give me a call when you 've finished , Will .


HOBSON ( following her ) .
Maggie !
It 's private .


MAGGIE .
Why , yes .
I 'm going and you can discuss it man to man with no fools of women about .


HOBSON .
I tell you I 've come to see you , not him .
It 's private from him .


MAGGIE .
Private from Will ?
Nay , it is n't .
Will 's in the family - ( comes back a little ) , - and you 've nowt to say to me that ca n't be said to him .


HOBSON .
I 've to tell you this with him there ?


MAGGIE .
Will and me 's one .


WILLIE .
Sit down , Mr. Hobson .


MAGGIE .
You call him father now .


WILLIE ( astonished ) .
Do I ?


HOBSON .
Does he ?


MAGGIE .
He does .
Sit down , Will .


( WILL sits right of table .
MAGGIE stands at the head of the table .
HOBSON sits on sofa . )


Now , if you 're ready , father , we are .
What 's the matter ?


HOBSON .
That - ( producing the blue paper ) - that 's the matter .


( MAGGIE accepts and passes it to WILL and goes behind his chair .
He is reading upside down .
She bends over chair and turns it right way up . )


MAGGIE .
What is it , Will ?


HOBSON ( banging table ) .
Ruin , Maggie , that 's what it is !
Ruin and bankruptcy .
Am I vicar 's warden at St. Philip 's or am I not ?
Am I Hobson of Hobson 's Boot Shop on Chapel Street , Salford ?
Am I a respectable ratepayer and the father of a family or - MAGGIE ( who has been reading over WILL 'S shoulder ) .
It 's an action for damages for trespass , I see .
HOBSON .
It 's a stab in the back , it 's an unfair , un-English , cowardly way of taking a mean advantage of a casual accident .


MAGGIE .
Did you trespass ?


HOBSON .
Maggie , I say it solemnly , it is all your fault .
I had an accident .
I do n't deny it .
I 'd been in the `` Moonraker 's '' and I 'd stayed too long .
And why ?
Why did I stay too long ?
To try to forget that I 'd a thankless child , to erase from the tablets of memory the recollection of your conduct .
That was the cause of it .
And the result , the blasting , withering result ?
I fell into that cellar .
I slept in that cellar and I awoke to this catastrophe .
Lawyers - law-costs - publicity - ruin .


MAGGIE ( moving round table to C. ) .
I 'm still asking you .
Was it an accident ?
Or did you trespass ?
HOBSON .
It 's an accident .
As plain as Salford Town Hall it 's an accident , but they that live by law have twisted ways of putting things that make white show as black .
I 'm in their grip at last .
I 've kept away from lawyers all my life , I 've hated lawyers , and they 've got their chance to make me bleed for it .
I 've dodged them , and they 've caught me in the end .
They 'll squeeze me dry for it .


WILLIE .
My word , and that 's summat like a squeeze and all .


( HOBSON stares at him . )


MAGGIE .
I can see it 's serious .
I should n't wonder if you did n't lose some trade from this .


HOBSON .
Wonder !
( Rising and moving C. ) It 's as certain as Christmas .
My good-class customers are not going to buy their boots from a man who 's stood up in open court and had to acknowledge he was overcome at 12 o'clock in the morning .
They 'll not remember it was private grief that caused it all .
They 'll only think the worse of me because I could n't control my daughter better than to let her go and be the cause of sorrow to me in my age .
That 's what you 've done .
Brought this on me , you two , between you .


WILLIE .
Do you think it will get into the paper , Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
Yes , for sure .
You 'll see your name in the Salford Reporter , father .
HOBSON .
Salford Reporter !
Yes , and more .
When there is ruin and disaster , and outrageous fortune overwhelms a man of my importance to the world , it is n't only the Salford Reporter that takes note of it .
This awful cross that 's come to me will be recorded in the Manchester Guardian for the whole of Lancashire to read .


WILLIE .
Eh , by gum , think of that !
To have your name appearing in the Guardian !
Why , it 's very near worth while to be ruined for the pleasure of reading about yourself in a printed paper .


HOBSON ( sits sofa ) .
It 's there for others to read besides me , my lad .


WILLIE .
Aye , you 're right .
I did n't think of that .
This ` ull give a lot of satisfaction to a many I could name .
Other people 's troubles is mostly what folks read the paper for , and I reckon it 's twice the pleasure to them when it 's trouble of a man they know themselves .
( He is perfectly simple and has no malicious intention . )


HOBSON .
To hear you talk it sounds like a pleasure to you .


WILLIE ( sincerely ) .
Nay , it 's not .
You 've ate my wedding cake and you 've shook my hand .
We 're friends , I hope , and I were nobbut meditating like a friend .
I always think it 's best to look on the worst side of things first , then whatever chances ca n't be worse than you looked for .
There 's St. Philip 's now .
I do n't suppose you 'll go on being vicar 's warden after this to do , and it brought you a powerful lot of customers from the church , did that .


HOBSON ( turning to her ) .
I 'm getting a lot of comfort from your husband , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
It 's about what you deserve .
( Goes to him . )


HOBSON .
Have you got any more consolation for me , Will ?


WILLIE ( aggrieved ) .
I only spoke what came into my mind .


HOBSON .
Well , have you spoken it all ?


WILLIE .
I can keep my mouth shut if you 'd rather .


HOBSON .
Do n't strain yourself , Will Mossop .
When a man 's mind is full of thoughts like yours , they 're better out than in .
You let them come , my lad .
They 'll leave a cleaner place behind .


WILLIE .
I 'm not much good at talking , and I always seem to say wrong things when I do talk .
I 'm sorry if my well-meant words do n't suit your taste , but I thought you came here for advice .


HOBSON .
I did n't come to you , you jumped-up cock-a-hooping - ( Rising . )


MAGGIE .
That ` ull do , father .
( Pushes him down . )
My husband 's trying to help you .


HOBSON ( glares impatiently for a time , then meekly says ) .
Yes , Maggie .
MAGGIE .
Now about this accident of yours .


HOBSON .
Yes , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
It 's the publicity that you 're afraid of most .


HOBSON .
It 's being dragged into a court of law at all , me that 's voted right all through my life and been a sound supporter of the Queen and Constitution .


MAGGIE .
Then we must try to keep it out of court .
( Moves away to L. C. )


HOBSON ( rising and moving to C. ) .
If there are lawyers in Heaven , Maggie , which I doubt , they may keep cases out of courts there .
On earth a lawyer 's job 's to squeeze a man and squeeze him where his squirming 's seen the most - in court .


MAGGIE .
I 've heard of cases being settled out of court , in private .


HOBSON .
In private ?
Yes , I dare say , and all the worse for that .
It 's done amongst themselves in lawyers ' offices behind closed doors so no one can see they 're squeezing twice as hard in private as they 'd dare to do in public .
There 's some restraint demanded by a public place , but privately !
It 'll cost a fortune to settle this in private , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
I make no doubt it 's going to cost you something , but you 'd rather do it privately than publicly ?


HOBSON ( coming back to sofa and sitting again ) .
If only it were not a lawyer 's office .


MAGGIE .
You can settle it with the lawyer out of his office .
You can settle with him here .


( She goes L. and opens door .
Then comes down L. ) Albert !


( Enter ALBERT , who leaves door open .
He comes C. )


This is Mr. Prosser , of Prosser , Pilkington , and Prosser .


HOBSON ( amazed ) .
He is !


MAGGIE .
Yes .


HOBSON ( incredulously , rising ) .
You 're a lawyer !


ALBERT .
Yes , I 'm a lawyer .


HOBSON ( with disgust almost too deep for words ) .
At your age !


MAGGIE ( going up to door ) .
Come out , all of you .
( She moves to top end of table . )


( There is reluctance inside , then VICKEY , ALICE and FRED enter and stand in a row , L. )


HOBSON .
Alice !
Vickey !


MAGGIE .
Family gathering .
This is Mr. Beenstock , of Beenstock c.. .
FREDDY .
How do you do ?


HOBSON .
What !
Here !


( The situation is plainly beyond his mused brain 's capacity . )


MAGGIE .
When you 've got a thing to settle , you need all the parties to be present .


HOBSON .
But there are so many of them .
Where have they all come from ?


MAGGIE .
My bedroom .


HOBSON .
Your - ?
Maggie , I wish you 'd explain before my brain gives way .


MAGGIE .
It 's quite simple .
I got them here because I expected you .


HOBSON .
You expected me !


MAGGIE .
Yes .
You 're in trouble .


HOBSON ( shaking his head , then as if finding an outlet , pouncing on ALICE ) .
What 's it got to do with Alice and Vickey ?
What are they doing here ?
What 's happening to the shop ?
( Moves C. )


ALICE .
Tubby Wadlow 's looking after it .


HOBSON .
And is it Tubby 's job to look after the shop ?


VICKEY .
He 'd got no other job .
The shop 's so slack since Maggie left .


HOBSON ( swelling with rage ) .
And do you run that shop ?
Do you give orders there ?
Do you decide when you can put your hats on and walk out of it ?


MAGGIE .
They come out because it 's my wedding-day , father .
It 's reason enough , and Will and me ` ull do the same for them .
We 'll close the shop and welcome on their wedding-days .


HOBSON .
Their wedding-days !
That 's a long time off .
It 'll be many a year before there 's another wedding in this family , I give you my word .
( Turns to MAGGIE . )
One daughter defying me is quite enough .


ALBERT .
Had n't we better get to business , sir ?


HOBSON ( turning on him ) .
Young man , do n't abuse a noble word .
You 're a lawyer .
By your own admission you 're a lawyer .
Honest men live by business and lawyers live by law .


ALBERT .
In this matter , sir , I am following the instructions of my client , Mr. Beenstock , and the remark you have just let fall , before witnesses , appears to me to bear a libellous reflection on the action of my client .


HOBSON .
What !
So it 's libel now .
Is n't trespass and - and spying on trade secrets enough for you , you blood-sucking - ( To ALBERT . )


ALBERT .
One moment , Mr. Hobson .
You can call me what you like -


HOBSON .
And I shall .
You -


ALBERT .
But I wish to remind you , in your own interests , that abuse of a lawyer is remembered in the costs .
Now , my client tells me he is prepared to settle this matter out of court .
Personally , I do n't advise him to , because we should probably get higher damages in court .
But Mr. Beenstock has no desire to be vindictive .
He remembers your position , your reputation for respectability , and -


HOBSON .
How much ?


ALBERT .
Er - I beg your pardon ?


HOBSON .
I 'm not so fond of the sound of your voice as you are .
What 's the figure ?
ALBERT .
The sum we propose , which will include my ordinary costs , but not any additional costs incurred by your use of defamatory language to me , is one thousand pounds .


HOBSON .
What !


MAGGIE .
It is n't .


HOBSON .
One thousand pounds for tumbling down a cellar !
Why , I might have broken my leg .
( Moves away to R. )


ALBERT .
That is in the nature of an admission , Mr. Hobson .
Our flour bags saved your legs from fracture and I am therefore inclined to add to the sum I have stated a reasonable estimate of the doctor 's bill we have saved you by protecting your legs with our bags .
( Turns towards FREDDY . )


( HOBSON sits R. )


MAGGIE .
Eh , Albert Prosser , I can see you 're going to get on in the world , but you need n't be greedy here .
That one thousand 's too much .
( Comes C. )


ALBERT .
We thought -


MAGGIE .
Then you can think again .


FREDDY .
But -


MAGGIE .
If there are any more signs of greediness from you two , there 'll be a counter-action for personal damages due to your criminal carelessness in leaving your cellar flap open .


HOBSON .
( rising ) .
Maggie , you 've saved me .
I 'll bring that action .
I 'll show them up .


MAGGIE .
You 're not damaged , and one lawyer 's quite enough .
But he 'll be more reasonable now .
I know perfectly well what father can afford to pay , and it 's not a thousand pounds nor anything like a thousand pounds .


HOBSON .
Not so much of your ca n't afford , Maggie .
You 'll make me out a pauper .


MAGGIE ( turns to HOBSON ) .
You can afford 500 pounds and you 're going to pay 500 pounds .


HOBSON .
Oh , but - there 's a difference between affording and paying .


MAGGIE .
You can go to the courts and be reported in the papers if you like .
( Moves to above table , R.C. )


HOBSON .
It 's the principle I care about .
I 'm being beaten by a lawyer .


VICKEY ( going to HOBSON ) .
Father , dear , how can you be beaten when they wanted a thousand pounds and you 're only going to give 500 pounds ?


HOBSON .
I had n't thought of that .


VICKEY .
It 's they who are beaten .


HOBSON .
I 'd take a good few beatings myself at the price , Vickey .
Still , I want this keeping out of court .
ALBERT .
Then we can take it as settled ?


HOBSON .
Do you want to see the money before you believe me ?
Is that your nasty lawyer 's way ?


ALBERT .
Not at all , Mr. Hobson .
Your word is as good as your bond .
( Moves back L. )


VICKEY .
It 's settled !
It 's settled !
Hurrah !
Hurrah !
( Moves L. to FREDDY . )
HOBSON .
Well , I do n't see what you have to cheer about , Vickey .
I 'm not to be dragged to public scorn , but you know this is a tidy bit of money to be going out of the family .
( Sits sofa , R. C. )


MAGGIE .
It 's not going out of the family , father .
( Moves up R. )


HOBSON .
I do n't see how you make it out .


MAGGIE .
Their wedding-day is not so far off as you thought , now there 's the half of five hundred pounds apiece for them to make a start on .


( ALBERT and ALICE , FRED and VICKEY stand arm in arm , L. ) HOBSON .
You mean to tell me -


MAGGIE .
You wo n't forget you 've passed your word , will you father ?


HOBSON ( rising ) .
I 've been diddled .
( Moves C. ) It 's a plant .
It -


MAGGIE .
It takes two daughters off your hands at once , and clears your shop of all the fools of women that used to lumber up the place .


ALICE .
It will be much easier for you without us in your way , father .


HOBSON .
Aye , and you can keep out of my way and all .
Do you hear that , all of you ?


VICKEY .
Father - !


HOBSON ( picking up his hat ) .
I 'll run that shop with men and - and I 'll show Salford how it should be run .
Do n't you imagine there 'll be room for you when you come home crying and tired of your fine husbands .
I 'm rid of ye , and it 's a lasting riddance , mind .
I 'll pay this money , that you 've robbed me of , and that 's the end of it .
All of you .
You , especially , Maggie .
I 'm not blind yet , and I can see who 't is I 've got to thank for this .
( He goes to foot of stairs . )


MAGGIE .
Do n't be vicious , father .


HOBSON .
Will Mossop , I 'm sorry for you .
( Over banisters . )
Take you for all in all , you 're the best of the bunch .
You 're a backward lad , but you know your trade and it 's an honest one .


( HOBSON is going up the stairs . )


ALICE .
So does my Albert know his trade .
( Goes R. C. )


HOBSON ( half-way up-stairs ) .
I 'll grant you that .
He knows his trade .
He 's good at robbery .
( ALICE shows great indignation . )
And I 've to have it on my conscience that my daughter 's wed a lawyer and an employer of lawyers .


VICKEY .
It did n't worry your conscience to keep us serving in the shop at no wages .


HOBSON .
I kept you , did n't I ?
It 's some one else 's job to victual you in future .
Aye , you may grin , you two , but girls do n't live on air .
Your penny buns ` ull cost you tuppence now - and more .
Wait , till the families begin to come .
Do n't come to me for keep , that 's all .
( Going . )


ALICE .
Father !


HOBSON ( turning ) .
Aye .
You may father me .
But that 's a piece of work I 've finished with .
I 've done with fathering , and they 're beginning it .
They 'll know what marrying a woman means before so long .
They 're putting chains upon themselves and I have thrown the shackles off .
I 've suffered thirty years and more and I 'm a free man from to-day .
Lord , what a thing you 're taking on !
You poor , poor wretches .
You 're red-nosed robbers , but you 're going to pay for it .


( He opens door and exits R. )


MAGGIE ( coming C. ) .
You 'd better arrange to get married quick .
Alice and Vickey will have a sweet time with him .


FREDDY .
Can they go home at all !


MAGGIE .
Why not ?


FREDDY .
After what he said ?


MAGGIE .
He 'll not remember half of it .
He 's for the `` Moonraker 's '' now - if there 's time .
What is the time ?


ALBERT .
Time we were going , Maggie - ( going to her , C. )  - you 'll be glad to see the back of us .
( He shows MAGGIE his watch . )


WILLIE .
No .
No .
( Rising . )
I would n't dream of asking you to go .


MAGGIE ( moving up to get hats ) .
Then I would .
It 's high time we turned you out .
There are your hats .


( She gets ALBERT 'S and FRED 'S hats from rack , R. )


Good night .


( ALBERT and FREDDY go upstairs .
MAGGIE comes back , C. )


Good night , Vickey .


VICKEY ( with a quick kiss ) .
Good night , Maggie .


( VICKEY goes upstairs .
She and FREDDY go out . )


MAGGIE .
Good night , Alice .


ALICE .
Good night , Maggie .
( The same quick kiss . )
And thank you .


MAGGIE .
Oh , that !
( She goes with her to stairs . )
I 'll see you again soon , only do n't come round here too much , because Will and me 's going to be busy and you 'll maybe find enough to do yourselves with getting wed. .


ALICE .
I dare say .
( Upstairs . )


( The general exit is continuous , punctuated with laughter and merry `` Good nights ! '' )


MAGGIE .
Send us word when the day is .


ALBERT .
We 'll be glad to see you at the wedding .


MAGGIE .
We 'll come to that .
You 'll be too grand for us afterwards .


ALBERT .
Oh , no , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
Well , happen we 'll be catching up with you before so long .
We 're only starting here .
Good night .


ALBERT  ALICE Good night , Maggie .


( They go out , closing door .
MAGGIE turns to WILL , putting her hands on his shoulders .
He starts . )


MAGGIE .
Now you 've heard what I 've said of you to-night .
In twenty years you 're going to be thought more of than either of your brothers-in-law .


WILLIE .
I heard you say it , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
And we 're to make it good .
I 'm not a boaster , Will .
And it 's to be in less than twenty years , and all .


WILLIE .
Well , I dunno .
They 've a long start on us .


MAGGIE .
And you 've got me .
Your slate 's in the bedroom .
Bring it out .
I 'll have this table clear by the time you come back .


( She moves round to R. of table and hustles off the last remains of the meal , putting the flowers on the mantel and takes off cloth , placing it over the back of the chair , R. WILL goes to bedroom and returns with a slate and slate pencil .
The slate is covered with writing .
He puts it on table . )


MAGGIE .
Off with your Sunday coat now .
You do n't want to make a mess of that .


( He takes coat off and gets rag from behind screen and brings it back to table .
He hangs his coat on a peg , R. )


What are you doing with that mopping rag ?


WILLIE .
I was going to wash out what 's on the slate .


MAGGIE .
Let me see it first .
That 's what you did last night at Tubby 's after I came here ?
WILLIE .
Yes , Maggie .


MAGGIE ( sitting at table up R. C. , reading ) .
`` There is always room at the top . ''
( Washing it out . )
Your writing 's improving , Will .
I 'll set you a short copy for to - night , because it 's getting late and we 've a lot to do in the morning .
( Writing . )
`` Great things grow from small . ''
Now , then , you can sit down here and copy that !


( He takes her place at the table .
MAGGIE watches a moment , then goes to fire-place and fingers the flowers . )


I 'll put these flowers of Mrs. Hepworth 's behind the fire , Will .
We 'll not want litter in the place come working time to-morrow .
( She takes up basin , stops , looks at WILL , who is bent over his slate , and takes a flower out , throwing the rest behind the fire and going to bedroom with the one . )


WILLIE ( looking up ) .
You 're saving one .


MAGGIE ( caught in an act of sentiment and apologetically ) .
I thought I 'd press it in my Bible for a keepsake , Will .
I 'm not beyond liking to be reminded of this day .


( She looks at screen and yawns . )


Lord , I 'm tired .
I reckon I 'll leave those pots till morning .
It 's a slackish way of starting , but I do n't get married every day .


WILLIE ( industrious at his slate ) .
No .


MAGGIE .
I 'm for my bed .
You finish that copy before you come .


WILLIE .
Yes , Maggie .


( Exit MAGGIE to bedroom , with the flower .
She closes door .
WILL copies , repeats letters and words as he writes them slowly , finishes , then rises and rakes out fire .
He looks shyly at bedroom door , sits and takes his boots off .
He rises , boots in hand , moves towards door , hesitates , and turns back , puts boots down at door , then returns to table and takes off his collar .
Then hesitates again , finally makes up his mind , puts out light , and lies down on sofa with occasional glances at the bedroom door .
At first he faces the fire .
He is uncomfortable .
He turns over and faces the door .
In a minute MAGGIE opens the bedroom door .
She has a candle and is in a plain calico night-dress .
She comes to WILL , shines the light on him , takes him by the ear , and returns with him to bedroom ) .

ACT IV


The scene represents HOBSON 'S living-room , the door to which was seen in Act I. From inside the room that door is now seen to be at the left , the opposite wall having the fire-place and another door to the house .


It is eight o'clock on a morning a year later .


In front of the fire-place is a horsehair arm-chair .
Chairs to match are at the table .
There are coloured prints of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort on the walls on each side of the door at the back , and a plain one of Lord Beaconsfield over the fire-place .
Antimacassars abound , and the decoration is quaintly ugly .
It is an overcrowded , `` cosy '' room .
HOBSON is quite contented with it , and does n't realize that it is at present very dirty .


There is probably a kitchen elsewhere , but TUBBY WADLOW is cooking bacon at the fire .
He is simultaneously laying breakfast for one on the table .
At both proceedings he is a puzzled and incompetent amateur .
Presently the left door opens , and JIM HEELER appears .


JIM ( crossing ) .
I 'll go straight up to him , Tubby .


TUBBY ( checking him ) .
He 's getting up , Mr. Heeler .


JIM .
Getting up !
Why , you said -


TUBBY .
I told you what he told me to tell you .
Run for Doctor MacFarlane , he said .
And I ran for Doctor MacFarlane .
Now go to Mr. Heeler , he said , and tell him I 'm very ill , and I came and told you .
Then he said he would get up , and I was to have his breakfast ready for him , and he 'd see you down here .
( Goes to fire , R. )


JIM ( moving towards door up R. ) .
Nonsense , Tubby .
Of course , I 'll go up to him .


TUBBY .
You know what he is , sir .
I 'll get blamed if you go , and he 's short-tempered this morning .


JIM .
I do n't want to get you into trouble , Tubby .
( He sits R. of table . )
TUBBY .
Thank you , Mr. Heeler .
( Puts bacon on plate and plate down on the hearth . )


JIM .
I quite thought it was something serious .


TUBBY .
If you ask me , it is .
( Coming back to table . )


JIM .
Which way ?


TUBBY ( cutting bread ) .
Every way you look at it .
Mr. Hobson 's not his own old self , and the shop 's not its own old self , and look at me .
Now I ask you , Mr. Heeler , man to man , is this work for a foreman shoe hand ?
Cooking and laying tables and -


JIM .
By all accounts there 's not much else for you to do .


TUBBY .
There 's better things than being a housemaid , if it 's only making clogs .
( Crosses to fire to toast . )


JIM .
They tell me clogs are a cut line .


TUBBY .
Well , what are you to do ?
There 's nothing else wanted .
( Turns . )
Hobson 's in a bad way , and I 'm telling no secret when I say it .
It 's a fact that 's known .


JIM .
It 's a thousand pities with an old-established trade like this .


TUBBY .
And who 's to blame ?


JIM .
I do n't think you ought to discuss that with me , Tubby .


TUBBY .
Do n't you ?
I 'm an old servant of the master 's , and I 'm sticking to him now when everybody 's calling me a doting fool because I do n't look after Tubby Wadlow first , and if that do n't give me the right to say what I please , I do n't know .
It 's temper 's ruining this shop , Mr. Heeler .
Temper and obstinacy .


JIM .
They say in Chapel Street it 's Willie Mossop .


TUBBY .
Willie 's a good lad , though I say it that trained him .
He hit us hard , did Willie , but we 'd have got round that in time .
With care , you understand , and tact .
Tact .
That 's what the gaffer lacks .
Miss Maggie , now - well , she 's a marvel , aye , a fair knock-out .
Not slavish , mind you .
Stood up to the customers all the time , but she 'd a way with her that sold the goods and made them come again for more .
Look at us now .
Men assistants in the shop .


JIM .
Cost more than women .


TUBBY .
Cost ?
They 'd be dear at any price .
Look here , Mr. Heeler , take yourself .
When you go to buy a pair of boots do you like to be tried on by a man or a nice soft young woman ?


JIM .
Well -


TUBBY .
There you are .
Stands to reason .
It 's human nature .


JIM .
But there are two sides to that , Tubby .
Look at the other .


TUBBY .
Ladies ?


JIM .
Yes .


TUBBY .
Ladies that are ladies wants trying on by their own sex , and them that are n't buys clogs .
It 's the good-class trade that pays , and Hobson 's have lost it .


( Enter HOBSON up R. , unshaven , without collar .
He comes down stage between them . )


JIM ( with cheerful sympathy ) .
Well , Henry !


HOBSON ( with acute melancholy and self-pity ) .
Oh , Jim !
Oh , Jim !
Oh , Jim !
TUBBY .
Will you sit on the arm-chair by the fire or at the table ?


HOBSON .
The table ?
Breakfast ?
Bacon ?
Bacon , and I 'm like this .


( JIM assists him to arm-chair . )


JIM .
When a man 's like this he wants a woman about the house , Henry .
HOBSON ( sitting ) .
I 'll want then .


TUBBY .
Shall I go for Miss Maggie , sir ?
- Mrs. Mossop , I mean .


JIM .
I think your daughters should be here .


HOBSON .
They should .
Only they 're not .
They 're married , and I 'm deserted by them all and I 'll die deserted , then perhaps they 'll be sorry for the way they 've treated me .
Tubby , have you got no work to do in the shop ?


TUBBY .
I might find some if I looked hard .


HOBSON .
Then go and look .
And take that bacon with you .
I do n't like the smell .


TUBBY ( getting bacon ) .
Are you sure you would n't like Miss Maggie here ?
I 'll go for her and - ( He holds the bacon very close to HOBSON 'S face . )


HOBSON .
Oh , go for her .
Go for the devil .
What does it matter who you go for ?
I 'm a dying man .


( TUBBY takes bacon and goes out L. )


JIM .
What 's all this talk about dying , Henry ?


HOBSON .
Oh , Jim !
Oh , Jim !
I 've sent for the doctor .
We 'll know soon how near the end is .


JIM .
Well , this is very sudden .
( Sits chair , R. ) You 've never been ill in your life .


HOBSON .
It 's been saved up , and all come now at once .


JIM .
What are your symptoms , Henry ?


HOBSON .
I 'm all one symptom , head to foot .
I 'm frightened of myself , Jim .
That 's worst .
You would call me a clean man , Jim ?


JIM .
Clean ?
Of course I would .
Clean in body and mind .


HOBSON .
I 'm dirty now .
I have n't washed this morning .
Could n't face the water .
The only use I saw for water was to drown myself .
The same with shaving .
I 've thrown my razor through the window .
Had to or I 'd have cut my throat .
JIM .
Oh , come , come .


HOBSON .
It 's awful .
I 'll never trust myself again .
I 'm going to grow a beard - if I live .


JIM .
You 'll cheat the undertaker , Henry , but I fancy a doctor could improve you .
What do you reckon is the cause of it now ?


HOBSON .
`` Moonraker 's . ''


JIM .
You do n't think -


HOBSON .
I do n't think .
I know .
I 've seen it happen to others , but I never thought that it would come to me .
JIM .
Nor me , neither .
You 're not a toper , Henry .
I grant you 're regular , but you do n't exceed .
It 's a hard thing if a man ca n't take a drop of ale without its getting back at him like this .
Why , it might be my turn next .


( TUBBY enters L. , showing in DOCTOR MACFARLANE , a domineering Scotsman of fifty . )


TUBBY .
Here 's Doctor MacFarlane .
( Exit TUBBY . )


DOCTOR .
Good morning , gentlemen .
Where 's my patient ?
( He puts hat on table . )


JIM ( speaking without indicating HOBSON ) .
Here .
( He does not rise . )


DOCTOR .
Here ?
Up ?


HOBSON .
Looks like it .


DOCTOR .
And for a patient who 's downstairs I 'm made to rise from my bed at this hour ?


JIM .
It 's not so early as all that .


DOCTOR .
But I 've been up all night , sir .
Young woman with her first .
Are you Mr. Hobson ?


JIM ( quickly ) .
Certainly not .
I 'm not ill .


DOCTOR .
Hum .
Not much to choose between you .
You 've both got your fate written on your faces .


JIM .
Do you mean that I - ?
( Rises . )


DOCTOR .
I mean he has and you will .


HOBSON .
Doctor , will you attend to me ?


( JIM moves round HOBSON 'S arm-chair to up stage and then to L. of table . )


DOCTOR .
Yes .
Now , sir .
( He sits by him and holds his wrist . )


HOBSON .
I 've never been in a bad way before this morning .
Never wanted a doctor in my life .


DOCTOR .
You 've needed .
But you 've not sent .


HOBSON .
But this morning -


DOCTOR .
I ken - well .


HOBSON .
What !
You know !


DOCTOR .
Any fool would ken .


HOBSON .
Eh ?


DOCTOR .
Any fool but one fool and that 's yourself .


HOBSON .
You 're damned polite .


DOCTOR .
If ye want flattery , I dare say ye can get it from your friend .
I 'm giving you ma medical opinion .


HOBSON .
I want your opinion on my complaint , not on my character .


DOCTOR .
Your complaint and your character are the same .


HOBSON .
Then you 'll kindly separate them and you 'll tell me -


DOCTOR ( rising and taking up hat ) .
I 'll tell you nothing , sir .
I do n't diagnose as my patients wish , but as my intellect and sagacity direct .
Good morning to you .
( Turns L. )


JIM ( meeting him below table ) .
But you have not diagnosed .


DOCTOR .
Sir , if I am to interview a patient in the presence of a third party , the least that third party can do is to keep his mouth shut .


JIM .
After that , there 's only one thing for it .
He shifts or I do .


HOBSON .
You 'd better go , Jim .


JIM .
There are other doctors , Henry .


HOBSON .
I 'll keep this one .
I 've got to teach him a lesson .
Scotchmen ca n't come over Salford lads this road .
JIM .
If that 's it , I 'll leave you .


HOBSON .
That 's it .
I can bully as well as a foreigner .


( JIM goes out L. )


DOCTOR .
That 's better , Mr. Hobson .
( He puts hat down and comes back R. )


HOBSON .
If I 'm better , you 've not had much to do with it .


DOCTOR .
I think my calculated rudeness -


HOBSON .
If you calculate your fees at the same rate as your rudeness , they 'll be high .


DOCTOR .
I calculate by time , Mr. Hobson , so we 'd better get to business .
Will you unbutton your shirt ?


HOBSON ( doing it ) .
No hanky-panky now .


DOCTOR ( ignoring his remark and examining ) .
Aye .
It just confirms ma first opinion .
Ye 've had a breakdown this A.M. ?


HOBSON .
You might say so .


DOCTOR .
Melancholic ?
Depressed ?


HOBSON ( buttoning shirt ) .
Question was whether the razor would beat me , or I 'd beat razor .
I won , that time .
The razor 's in the yard .
But I 'll never dare to try shaving myself again .


DOCTOR .
And do you seriously require me to tell you the cause , Mr. Hobson ?
HOBSON .
I 'm paying thee brass to tell me .


DOCTOR .
Chronic alcoholism , if you know that what means .


HOBSON .
Aye .


DOCTOR .
A serious case .


HOBSON .
I know it 's serious .
What do you think you 're here for ?
It is n't to tell me something I know already .
It 's to cure me .
DOCTOR .
Very well .
I will write you a prescription .
( Produces notebook .
Sits at table and writes with copying pencil . )


HOBSON .
Stop that !


DOCTOR .
I beg your pardon ?


HOBSON .
I wo n't take it .
None of your druggist 's muck for me .
I 'm particular about what I put into my stomach .


DOCTOR .
Mr. Hobson , if you do n't mend your manners , I 'll certify you for a lunatic asylum .
Are you aware that you 've drunk yourself within six months of the grave ?
You 'd a warning this morning that any sane man would listen to and you 're going to listen to it , sir .


HOBSON .
By taking your prescription ?


DOCTOR .
Precisely .
You will take this mixture , Mr. Hobson , and you will practise total abstinence for the future .


HOBSON .
You ask me to give up my reasonable refreshment !


DOCTOR .
I forbid alcohol absolutely .
( Starts writing . )


HOBSON .
Much use your forbidding is .
I 've had my liquor for as long as I remember , and I 'll have it to the end .
If I 'm to be beaten by beer I 'll die fighting , and I 'm none practising unnatural teetotalism for the sake of lengthening out my unalcoholic days .
Life 's got to be worth living before I 'll live it .


DOCTOR ( rising and taking hat again ) .
If that 's the way you talk , my services are of no use to you .
( Moves down L. )


HOBSON .
They 're not .
I 'll pay you on the nail for this .
( Rising and sorting money from pocket . )


DOCTOR .
I congratulate you on the impulse , Mr. Hobson .


HOBSON .
Nay , it 's a fair deal , doctor .
I 've had value .
You 've been a tonic to me .
When I got up I never thought to see the `` Moonraker 's '' again , but I 'm ready for my early morning draught this minute .
( Holds out money . )


DOCTOR ( putting hat down , moving to HOBSON and talking earnestly ) .
Man , will ye no be warned ?
Ye pig-headed animal , alcohol is poison to ye , deadly , virulent with a system in the state yours is .


HOBSON .
You 're getting warm about it .
Will you take your fee ?
( Holding out money . )


DOCTOR .
Yes .
When I 've earned it .
Put it in your pocket , Mr. Hobson .
I hae na finished with ye yet .
HOBSON .
I thought you had .
( Sits again . )


DOCTOR ( up to HOBSON , R. ) .
Do ye ken that ye 're defying me ?
Ye 'll die fighting , will ye ?
Aye , it 's a gay , high-sounding sentiment , ma mannie , but ye 'll no dae it , do ye hear ?
Ye 'll no slip from me now .
I 've got ma grip on ye .
Ye 'll die sober , and ye 'll live the longest time ye can before ye die .
Have ye a wife , Mr. Hobson ?


( HOBSON points upwards . )


In bed ?


HOBSON .
Higher than that .


DOCTOR .
It 's a pity .
A man like you should keep a wife handy .


HOBSON .
I 'm not so partial to women .


DOCTOR .
Women are a necessity , sir .
Have ye no female relative that can manage ye ?


HOBSON .
Manage ?


DOCTOR .
Keep her thumb firm on ye ?


HOBSON .
I 've got three daughters , Doctor MacFarlane , and they tried to keep their thumbs on me .


DOCTOR .
Well ?
Where are they ?


HOBSON .
Married - and queerly married .


DOCTOR .
You drove them to it .


HOBSON .
They all grew uppish .
Maggie worst of all .


DOCTOR .
Maggie ?
Then I 'll tell ye what ye 'll do , Mr. Hobson .
You will get Maggie back .
At any price .
At all costs to your pride , as your medical man I order you to get Maggie back .
( Movement from HOBSON . )
I do n't know Maggie , but I prescribe her , and - damn ye , sir , are ye going to defy me again ?


HOBSON .
I tell you I wo n't have it .


DOCTOR .
You 'll have to have it .
You 're a dunderheaded lump of obstinacy , but I 've taken a fancy to ye and I decline to let ye kill yeself .


HOBSON .
I 've escaped from the thraldom of women once , and -


DOCTOR .
And a pretty mess you 've made of your liberty .
Now this Maggie ye mention - if ye 'll tell me where she 's to be found , I 'll just step round and have a crack with her maself , for I 've gone beyond the sparing of a bit of trouble over ye .


HOBSON .
You 'll waste your time .


DOCTOR .
I 'll cure you , Mr. Hobson .
( Crosses to C. and turns . )


HOBSON .
She wo n't come back .


DOCTOR .
Oh .
Now that 's a possibility .
If she 's a sensible body I concur with your opinion she 'll no come back , but women are a soft-hearted race and she 'll maybe take pity on ye after all .


HOBSON .
I want no pity .


DOCTOR .
If she 's the woman that I take her for ye 'll get no pity .
Ye 'll get discipline .
( HOBSON rises and tries to speak . )


Do n't interrupt me , sir .
I 'm talking .


HOBSON .
I 've noticed it .
( Sits . )


DOCTOR .
You asked me for a cure , and Maggie 's the name of the cure you need .
Maggie , sir , do you hear ?
Maggie !


( Enter MAGGIE L. , in outdoor clothes . )


MAGGIE .
What about me ?


DOCTOR ( staggered , then ) .
Are you Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
I 'm Maggie .


DOCTOR .
Ye 'll do .


HOBSON ( getting his breath ) .
What are you doing under my roof ?


MAGGIE .
I 've come because I was fetched .
( Coming C. )


HOBSON .
Who fetched you ?


MAGGIE .
Tubby Wadlow .


HOBSON ( rising ) .
Tubby can quit my shop this minute .


DOCTOR ( putting him back ) .
Sit down , Mr. Hobson .


MAGGIE .
He said you 're dangerously ill .


DOCTOR .
He is .
I 'm Doctor MacFarlane .
( Coming C. ) Will you come and live here again ?


MAGGIE .
I 'm married .


DOCTOR .
I know that , Mrs. -


MAGGIE .
Mossop .


DOCTOR .
Your father 's drinking himself to death , Mrs. Mossop .


HOBSON .
Look here , Doctor , what 's passed between you and me is n't for everybody 's ears .


DOCTOR .
I judge your daughter 's not the sort to want the truth wrapped round with a feather-bed for fear it hits her hard .


MAGGIE ( nodding appreciatively ) .
Go on .
I 'd like to hear it all .
( Goes to and sits in chair R. of table . )


HOBSON .
Just nasty-minded curiosity .


DOCTOR .
I do n't agree with you , Mr. Hobson .
If Mrs. Mossop is to sacrifice her own home to come to you , she 's every right to know the reason why .


HOBSON .
Sacrifice !
If you saw her home you 'd find another word than that .
Two cellars in Oldfield Road .


MAGGIE .
I 'm waiting , Doctor .


DOCTOR .
I 've a constitutional objection to seeing patients slip through ma fingers when it 's avoidable , Mrs. Mossop , and I 'll do ma best for your father , but ma medicine will na do him any good without your medicine to back me up .
He needs a tight hand on him all the time .


MAGGIE .
I 've not same chance I had before I married .


DOCTOR .
Ye 'll have no chance at all unless ye come and live here .
I willna talk about the duty of a daughter because I doubt he 's acted badly by ye , but on the broad grounds of humanity , it 's saving life if ye 'll come -


MAGGIE .
I might .


DOCTOR .
Nay , but will ye ?


MAGGIE .
You 've told me what you think .
The rest 's my business .
( Rises and goes L. )


HOBSON .
That 's right , Maggie .
( To DOCTOR . )
That 's what you get for interfering with folks ' private affairs .
So now you can go , with your tail between your legs , Doctor MacFarlane .


DOCTOR .
On the contrary , I am going , Mr. Hobson , with the profound conviction that I leave you in excellent hands .
( R. of table . )
One prescription is on the table , Mrs. Mossop .
The other two are total abstinence and - you .


MAGGIE ( nodding amiably ) .
Good morning .


DOCTOR .
Good morning .


( Exit DOCTOR L. MAGGIE picks up prescription and follows to door , L. ) MAGGIE .
Tubby !


( She stands by door , TUBBY just enters inside it . )


Go round to Oldfield Road and ask my husband to come here and get this made up at Hallow 's on your way back .


TUBBY .
Yes , Miss - Mrs. Mossop .


MAGGIE .
Tell Mr. Mossop that I want him quick .


( TUBBY nods and goes .
MAGGIE goes R. )


HOBSON .
Maggie , you know I ca n't be an abstainer .
A man of my habits .
At my time of life .


MAGGIE .
You can if I come here to make you .


HOBSON .
Are you coming ?


MAGGIE .
I do n't know yet .
I have n't asked my husband .


HOBSON .
You ask Will Mossop !
Maggie , I 'd better thoughts of you .
Making an excuse like that to me .
If you want to come you 'll come so what Will Mossop says and well you know it .


MAGGIE .
I do n't want to come , father .
I expect no holiday existence here with you to keep in health .
But if Will tells me it 's my duty I shall come .
( Sits R. of table . )


HOBSON .
You know as well as I do asking Will 's a matter of form .


MAGGIE .
Matter of form !
( Rises and moves R. ) My husband a matter of form !
He 's the -


HOBSON .
I dare say , but he is not the man that wears the breeches at your house .


MAGGIE .
My husband 's my husband , father , so whatever else he is .
And my home 's my home , and all and what you said of it now to Doctor MacFarlane 's a thing you 'll pay for .
It 's no gift to a married woman to come back to the home she 's shut of .
( Moves back R. C. )


HOBSON .
Look here , Maggie , you 're talking straight and I 'll talk straight and all .
When I 'm set I 'm set .
You 're coming here .
I did n't want you when that doctor said it , but , by gum , I want you now .
It 's been my daughters ' hobby crossing me .
Now you 'll come and look after me .


MAGGIE .
All of us ?


HOBSON .
No .
Not all of you .
You 're eldest .


MAGGIE .
There 's another man with claims on me .


HOBSON .
I 'll give him claims .
Are n't I your father ?


( ALICE enters L .
She is rather elaborately dressed for so early in the day , and languidly haughty . )


MAGGIE .
And I 'm not your only daughter .


ALICE .
You been here long , Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
A while .


ALICE ( L.C. ) .
Ah , well , a fashionable solicitor 's wife does n't rise so early as the wife of a working cobbler .
You 'd be up when Tubby came .


MAGGIE .
A couple of hours earlier .
( Moves up R. )


ALICE ( going to HOBSON ) .
You 're looking all right , father .
You 've quite a colour .
HOBSON .
I 'm very ill .


MAGGIE ( sitting R. of table ) .
He 's not so well , Alice .
The doctor says one of us must come and live here to look after him .


ALICE .
I live in the Crescent myself .


MAGGIE .
I 've heard it was that way on .
Somebody 's home will have to go .


ALICE .
I do n't think I can be expected to come back to this after what I 've been used to lately .


HOBSON .
Alice !


ALICE .
Well , I say it ought to be Maggie , father .
She 's the eldest .
( Moves to above table . )


HOBSON .
And I say you 're -


( What she is we do n't learn , as VICKEY enters effectively and goes effusively to HOBSON , R. ALICE moves round to L. )


VICKEY .
Father , you 're ill !
( Embracing him . )


HOBSON .
Vickey !
My baby !
At last I find a daughter who cares for me .


VICKEY .
Of course I care .
Do n't the others ?
( Releasing herself from his grasp . )


HOBSON .
You will live with me , Vickey , wo n't you ?


VICKEY .
What ?
( She stands away from him . )


MAGGIE .
One of us is needed to look after him .


VICKEY .
Oh , but it ca n't be me .
In my circumstances , Maggie !


MAGGIE .
What circumstances ?


ALICE .
Do n't you know ?


MAGGIE .
No .


( VICKEY whispers to MAGGIE . )


HOBSON .
What 's the matter ?
What are you all whispering about ?


MAGGIE .
Father , do n't you think you ought to put a collar on before Will comes ?
( Goes to him , R. )


HOBSON .
Put a collar on for Will Mossop ?
There 's something wrong with your sense of proportion , my girl .


VICKEY ( moving C. ) .
You 're always pretending to folk about your husband , Maggie , but you need n't keep it up with us .
We know Will here .


MAGGIE .
Father , either I can go home or you can go and put a collar on for Will .
I 'll have him treated with respect .
( Going up to window . )


ALICE .
I expect you 'd put a collar on in any case , father .


HOBSON ( rising ) .
Of course I should .
I 'm going to put a collar on .
But understand me , Maggie , it 's not for the sake of Will Mossop .
It 's because my neck is cold .


( Exit HOBSON R. )


MAGGIE ( coming down ) .
Now , then , which of us is it to be ?


VICKEY .
It 's no use looking at me like that , Maggie .
I 've told you I 'm expecting .


MAGGIE .
I do n't see that that rules you out .
It might happen to any of us .


ALICE .
Maggie !


MAGGIE .
What 's the matter ?
Children do happen to married women , and we 're all married .


ALICE .
Well , I 'm not going to break my home up and that 's flat .


VICKEY .
My child comes first with me .


MAGGIE .
I see .
You 've got a house of furniture , and you 've got a child coming , so father can drink himself to death for you .


ALICE .
That 's not fair speaking .
I 'd come if there were no one else .
You know very well it 's your duty , Maggie .


VICKEY .
Duty ?
I should think it ` ud be a pleasure to live here after a year of two cellars .


MAGGIE .
I 've had thirty years of the pleasure of living with father , thanks .
( Going to chair R. of table and sitting . )


ALICE .
Do you mean to say you wo n't come ?


MAGGIE .
It is n't for me to say at all .
It 's for my husband .


VICKEY .
Oh , do stop talking about your husband .
If Alice and I do n't need to ask our husbands , I 'm sure you never need ask yours .
Will Mossop has n't the spirit of a louse and we know it as well as you do .
( Crosses to fire-place . )


MAGGIE .
Maybe Will 's come on since you saw him , Vickey .
It 's getting a while ago .
There he is now in the shop .
I 'll go and put it to him .


( Rises and exits MAGGIE L. )


VICKEY .
Stop her !
( Going to door . )


ALICE ( detaining her ) .
Let her do it in her own way .
I 'm not coming back here .


VICKEY ( R. of ALICE ) .
Nor me .


ALICE .
There 's only Maggie for it .


VICKEY .
Yes .
But we 've got to be careful , Alice .
She must n't have things too much her way .


ALICE .
It 's our way as well , is n't it ?


VICKEY .
Not coming is our way .
But when she 's with him alone and we 're not - ( Stopping . )


ALICE .
Yes .


VICKEY .
Ca n't you see what I 'm thinking , Alice ?
It is so difficult to say .
Suppose poor father gets worse and they are here , Maggie and Will , and you and I - out of sight and out of mind .
Ca n't you see what I mean ?


ALICE .
He might leave them his money !


VICKEY .
That would be most unfair to us .


ALICE .
Father must make his will at once .
Albert shall draw it up .
( Goes R. )


VICKEY .
That 's it , Alice .
And do n't let 's leave Maggie too long with Will .
She 's only telling him what to say , and then she 'll pretend he thought of it himself .
( She opens door left . )
Why , Will , what are you doing up the ladder ?


WILLIE ( off L ) .
I 'm looking over the stock .


VICKEY ( indignantly ) .
It 's father 's stock , not yours .


WILLIE .
That 's so .
But if I 'm to come into a thing I like to know what I 'm coming into .


ALICE .
That 's never Willie Mossop .


VICKEY ( still by door ) .
Are you coming into this ?


( WILL enters L. MAGGIE follows him .
He is not aggressive , but he is prosperous and has self-confidence .
Against ALICE and VICKEY he is consciously on his mettle . )


WILLIE .
That 's the proposal , is n't it ?


VICKEY ( C. ) .
I did n't know it was .


WILLIE .
Now , then , Maggie , go and bring your father down and be sharp .
I 'm busy at my shop , so what they are at his .


( MAGGIE takes WILL 'S hat off and puts it on settee , then exits up R. )


It 's been a good business in its day , too , has Hobson 's .


ALICE .
What on earth do you mean ?
It 's a good business still .


WILLIE .
You try to sell it , and you 'd learn .
Stock and goodwill ` ud fetch about two hundred .
( Goes C. )


VICKEY .
Do n't talk so foolish , Will .
Two hundred for a business like father 's !


WILLIE .
Two hundred as it is .
Not as it was in our time , Vickey .


ALICE .
Do you mean to tell me father is n't rich ?


WILLIE .
If you 'd not married into the law you 'd know what they think of your father to-day in trading circles .
Vickey ought to know .
Her husband 's in trade .


VICKEY ( indignantly ) .
My Fred in trade !


WILLIE .
Is n't he ?


VICKEY .
He 's in the wholesale .
That 's business , not trade .
And the value of father 's shop is no affair of yours , Will Mossop .
( Moves L. )


WILLIE .
Now I thought maybe it was .
If Maggie and me are coming here -


VICKEY .
You 're coming to look after father .


WILLIE .
Maggie can do that with one hand tied behind her back .
I 'll look after the business .
ALICE .
You 'll do what 's arranged for you .


WILLIE .
I 'll do the arranging , Alice .
If we come here , we come here on my terms .


VICKEY .
They 'll be fair terms .


WILLIE .
I 'll see they 're fair to me and Maggie .
( Goes R. )


ALICE .
Will Mossop , do you know who you 're talking to ?


WILLIE ( turning ) .
Aye .
My wife 's young sisters .
Times have changed a bit since you used to order me about this shop , have n't they , Alice ?


ALICE .
Yes .
I 'm Mrs. Albert Prosser now .


WILLIE .
So you are , to outsiders .
And you 'd be surprised the number of people that call me Mr. Mossop now .
We do get on in the world , do n't we ?
( ALICE moves up stage . )


VICKEY .
Some folks get on too fast .


WILLIE .
It 's a matter of opinion .
( Coming C. ) I know Maggie and me gave both of you a big leg up when we arranged your marriage portions , but I dunno that we 're grudging you the sudden lift you got .


( Enter HOBSON and MAGGIE . )


WILLIE .
Good morning , father .
I 'm sorry to hear you 're not so well .


HOBSON .
I 'm a changed man , Will .
( He comes down and sits on arm-chair , R. )


WILLIE .
There used to be room for improvement .


HOBSON .
What !
( He starts up . )


MAGGIE .
Sit down , father .


WILLIE ( sitting R. of table ) .
Aye .
Do n't let us be too long about this .
You 've kept me waiting now a good while and my time 's valuable .
I 'm busy at my shop .


HOBSON .
Is your shop more important than my life ?


WILLIE .
That 's a bit like asking if a pound of tea weighs heavier than a pound of lead .
I 'm worrited about your life because it worrits Maggie , but I 'm none worrited that bad I 'll see my business suffer for the sake of you .


HOBSON .
This is n't what I 've a right to expect from you , Will .


WILLIE .
You 've no right to expect I care whether you sink or swim .


MAGGIE .
Will !


WILLIE .
What 's to do ?
You told me to take a high hand , did n't you ?


( MAGGIE sits down R. )


ALICE .
And we 're to stay here and watch Maggie and Will abusing father when he 's ill .


( Positions now : MAGGIE sitting down R. , HOBSON sitting in armchair , ALICE standing behind and between them , VICKEY standing L. of table . )


WILLIE .
No need for you to stay .


HOBSON .
That 's a true word , Will Mossop .


VICKEY .
Father !
You take his side against your flesh and blood .


HOBSON .
That does n't come too well from you , my girl .
Neither of you would leave your homes to come to care for me .
You 're not for me , so you 're against me .


ALICE .
We 're not against you , father .
We want to stay and see that Will deals fairly by you .


HOBSON .
Oh , I 'm not capable of looking after myself , am n't I ?
I 've to be protected by you girls lest I 'm overreached , and overreached by whom ?
By Willie Mossop !
I may be ailing , but I 've fight enough left in me for a dozen such as him , and if you 're thinking that the manhood 's gone from me , you can go and think it somewhere else than in my house .


VICKEY .
But father - dear father -


HOBSON .
I 'm not so dear to you if you 'd to think twice about coming here to do for me , let alone jibbing at it the way you did .
A proper daughter would have jumped - aye , skipped like a calf by the cedars of Lebanon - at the thought of being helpful to her father .


ALICE .
Did Maggie skip ?


HOBSON .
She 's a bit ancient for skipping exercise , is Maggie  but she 's coming round to reconcilement with the thought of living here , and that is more than you are doing , Alice , is n't it ?
Eh ?
Are you willing to come ?


ALICE ( sullenly ) .
No .


HOBSON .
Or you , Vickey ?


VICKEY .
It 's my child , father .
I -


HOBSON .
Never mind what it is .
Are you coming or not ?


VICKEY .
No .


HOBSON .
Then you that are n't willing can leave me to talk with them that are .


ALICE .
Do you mean that we 're to go ?


HOBSON .
I understand you 've homes to go to .


ALICE .
Oh , father !


HOBSON .
Open the door for them , Will .


( WILL rises , crosses , and opens door .
ALICE and VICKEY stare in silent anger .
Then ALICE sweeps to her gloves on the table . )


ALICE .
Vickey !


( ALICE moves on towards door . )


VICKEY .
Well , I do n't know !


MAGGIE ( from her chair by the fire-place ) .
We 'll be glad to see you here at tea-time on a Sunday afternoon if you 'll condescend to come sometimes .


VICKEY .
Beggars on horseback .


( VICKEY and ALICE pass out . )


WILL ( closing door ) .
Nay , come , there 's no ill-will .
( He returns to table and sits R. of it . )


HOBSON .
Now , my lad , I 'll tell you what I 'll do .


WILLIE .
Aye , we can come to grips better now there are no fine ladies about .


HOBSON .
They 've got stiff necks with pride , and the difference between you two and them 's a thing I ought to mark and that I 'm going to mark .
There 's times for holding back and times for letting loose , and being generous .
Now , you 're coming here , to this house , both of you , and you can have the back bedroom for your own and the use of this room split along with me .
Maggie ` ull keep house , and if she 's time to spare she can lend a hand in the shop .
I 'm finding Will a job .
You can come back to your old bench in the cellar , Will , and I 'll pay you the old wage of eighteen shillings a week and you and me ` ull go equal whacks in the cost of the housekeeping , and if that 's not handsome , I dunno what is .
I 'm finding you a house rent free and paying half the keep of your wife .


WILLIE .
Come home , Maggie .
( He rises , goes L. )


MAGGIE .
I think I 'll have to .
( She rises . )


HOBSON .
Whatever 's the hurry for ?


WILLIE .
It may be news to you - ( moving a little R. ) , - but I 've a business round in Oldfield Road and I 'm neglecting it with wasting my time here .


HOBSON .
Wasting time ?
Maggie , what 's the matter with Will ?
I 've made him a proposal .


MAGGIE .
He 's a shop of his own to see to , father .


HOBSON .
( incredulous ) .
A man who 's offered a job at Hobson 's does n't want to worry with a shop of his own in a wretched cellar in Oldfield Road .


WILLIE .
Shall I tell him , Maggie , or shall we go ?


HOBSON .
Go !
I do n't want to keep a man who - ( Rises . )


MAGGIE .
If he goes , I go with him , father .
You 'd better speak out , Will .


WILLIE .
All right , I will .
We 've been a year in yon wretched cellar and do you know what we 've done ?
We 've paid off Mrs. Hepworth what she lent us for our start and made a bit o ' brass on top o ' that .
We 've got your high-class trade away from you .
That shop 's a cellar , and as you say , it 's wretched , but they come to us in it , and they do n't come to you .
Your trade 's gone down till all you sell is clogs .
You 've got no trade , and me and Maggie 's got it all and now you 're on your bended knees to her to come and live with you , and all you think to offer me is my old job at eighteen shillings a week .
Me that 's the owner of a business that is starving yours to death .


HOBSON .
But - but - you 're Will Mossop , you 're my old shoe hand .


WILLIE .
Aye .
I were , but I 've moved on a bit since then .
Your daughter married me and set about my education .
And - and now I 'll tell you what I 'll do and it 'll be the handsome thing and all from me to you .
I 'll close my shop -


HOBSON .
Oh !
That does n't sound like doing so well .


WILLIE .
I 'm doing well , but I 'll do better here .
I 'll transfer to this address and what I 'll do that 's generous is this : I 'll take you into partnership and give you your half-share on the condition you 're sleeping partner and you do n't try interference on with me .
( Goes L. )


HOBSON .
A partner !
You - here -


WILLIE .
William Mossop , late Hobson , is the name this shop ` ull have .


MAGGIE .
Wait a bit , Will .
I do n't agree to that .


HOBSON ( over to her ) .
Oh , so you have piped up at last .
I began to think you 'd both lost your senses together .


MAGGIE .
It had better not be `` late Hobson . ''


WILLIE ( L. C. ) .
Well , I meant it should .


HOBSON .
Just wait a bit .
I want to know if I 'm taking this in aright .
( Moves R. C. ) I 'm to be given a half-share in my own business on condition I take no part in running it .
Is that what you said ?


WILLIE .
That 's it .


HOBSON .
Well , I 've heard of impudence before , but -


MAGGIE .
It 's all right , father .


HOBSON .
But did you hear what he said ?


MAGGIE .
Yes .
That 's settled .
Quite settled , father .
( Pushing him . )
It 's only the name we 're arguing about .
( To WILL . )
I wo n't have `` late Hobson 's '' , Will .


HOBSON .
I 'm not dead , yet , my lad , and I 'll show you I 'm not .


MAGGIE .
I think Hobson and Mossop is best .


HOBSON .
His name on my sign-board !


WILLIE .
The best I 'll do is this : Mossop and Hobson .


MAGGIE .
No .


WILLIE .
Mossop and Hobson or it 's Oldfield Road for us , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
Very well .
Mossop and Hobson .


( WILL moves L. )


HOBSON .
But -


( MAGGIE moves up stage R. )


WILLIE ( opening door and looking through ) .
I 'll make some alterations in this shop , and all .
I will so .
( He goes through door and returns at once with a battered cane chair . )


HOBSON .
Alterations in my shop !
( Goes C. )


WILLIE .
In mine .
Look at that chair .
How can you expect the high - class customers to come and sit on a chair like that ?
Why , we 'd only a cellar , but they did sit on cretonne for their trying on .


HOBSON .
Cretonne !
It 's pampering folk .


( MAGGIE comes down stage R. )


WILLIE .
Cretonne for a cellar , and morocco for this shop .
Folk like to be pampered .
Pampering pays .
( He takes the chair out and returns immediately . )
There 'll be a carpet on that floor , too .


HOBSON .
Carpet !
Morocco !
Young man , do you think this shop is in Saint Ann 's Square , Manchester ?
WILLIE .
Not yet .
But it is going to be .


HOBSON .
What does he mean ?
( Appealing to heaven . )


WILLIE .
It 's no farther from Chapel Street to Saint Ann 's Square than it is from Oldfield Road to Chapel Street .
I 've done one jump in a year and if I wait a bit I 'll do the other .
( HOBSON sits R. of table . )
Maggie , I reckon your father could do with a bit of fresh air after this .
I dare say it 's come sudden to him .
Suppose you walk with him to Albert Prosser 's office and get Albert to draw up the deed of partnership .


HOBSON ( looking pathetically first at MAGGIE , then at WILLIE , rising obediently ) .
I 'll go and get my hat .


( Exit HOBSON R. )


WILLIE .
He 's crushed-like , Maggie .
I 'm afraid I bore on him too hard .
( Going R. C. )


MAGGIE .
You need n't be .


WILLIE .
I said such things to him , and they sounded as if I meant them , too .


MAGGIE .
Did n't you ?


WILLIE .
Did I ?
Yes - I suppose I did .
That 's just the worst - from me to him .
You told me to be strong and use the power that 's come to me through you , but he 's the old master , and -


MAGGIE .
And you 're the new .


WILLIE .
Master of Hobson 's !
It 's an outrageous big idea .
Did I sound confident , Maggie ?


MAGGIE .
You did all right .


WILLIE ( sits R. of table ) .
Eh , but I were n't by half so certain as I sounded .
Words came from my mouth that made me jump at my own boldness , and when it came to facing you about the name , I tell you I fair trembled in my shoes .
I was carried away like , or I 'd not have dared to cross you , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
Do n't spoil it , Will .
( Moves to him . )
You 're the man I 've made you and I 'm proud .


WILLIE .
Thy pride is not in same street , lass , with the pride I have in you .
And that reminds me .
( Rises , moves up and gets his hat . )
I 've a job to see to .


MAGGIE .
What job ?


WILLIE ( coming down L. ) .
Oh - about the improvements .


MAGGIE .
You 'll not do owt without consulting me .


WILLIE .
I 'll do this , lass .
( Goes to and takes her hand . )


MAGGIE .
What are you doing ?
You leave my wedding ring alone .
( Wrenches hand free . )


WILLIE .
You 've worn a brass one long enough .


MAGGIE .
I 'll wear that ring for ever , Will .


WILLIE .
I was for getting you a proper one , Maggie .


MAGGIE .
I 'm not preventing you .
I 'll wear your gold for show , but that brass stays where you put it , Will , and if we get too rich and proud we 'll just sit down together quiet and take a long look at it , so as we 'll not forget the truth about ourselves - Eh , lad !
( She touches him affectionately . )


WILL .
Eh , lass !
( He kisses her . )


( Enter HOBSON R. with his hat on . )


MAGGIE .
Ready , father .
Come along to Albert 's .


HOBSON ( meekly ) .
Yes , Maggie .


( MAGGIE and HOBSON cross below WILL and go out L. WILL comes down with amazement , triumph and incredulity written on his face , and attempts to express the inexpressible by saying - )


WILL .
Well , by gum !
( He turns to follow the others . )


CURTAIN .
