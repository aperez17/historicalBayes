PROLOGUE


Spoke by MR. WILKS .


Authors are judg'd by strange capricious rules , The great ones are thought mad , the small ones fools .
Yet sure the best are most severely fated , For fools are only laugh'd at , wits are hated , Blockheads with reason , men of sense abhor  But fool ` gainst fool is barb ` rous civil war .
Why on all authors then should critics fall ?
Since some have writ , and shewn no wit at all .
Condemn a play of theirs , and they evade it , Cry , damn not us , but damn the French that made it  By running goods , these graceless owlers gain , Theirs are the rules of France , the plots of Spain : But wit , like wine , from happier climates brought , Dash'd by these rogues , turns English common draught : They pall Moliere 's and Lopez sprightly strain , And teach dull Harlequins to grin in vain .
How shall our author hope a gentle fate , Who dares most impudently -- not translate .
It had been civil in these ticklish times , To fetch his fools and knaves from foreign climes  Spaniards and French abuse to the worlds ' end But spare old England , lest you hurt a friend .
If any fool is by your satire bit , Let him hiss loud , to show you all -- he 's hit .
Poets make characters as salesmen cloaths , We take no measure of your fops and beaus .
But here all sizes and all shapes ye meet , And fit yourselves -- like chaps in Monmouth-street .


Gallants look here , this [ B ] fool 's cap has an air -- Goodly and smart , -- with ears of Issachar .
Let no one fool engross it , or confine : A common blessing !
now 't is your 's , now mine .
But poets in all ages , had the Care To keep this cap , for such as will , to wear  Our author has it now , for ev'ry wit Of course resign'd it to the next that writ : And thus upon the stage 't is fairly [ C ] thrown , Let him that takes it , wear it for his own .

MARRIAGE :


A


COMEDY .


ACT I .


Enter FOSSILE , leading TOWNLEY .


Fos .
Welcome , my bride , into the habitation of thy husband .
The scruples of the parson --


Town .
And the fatigue of the ceremony --


Foss .
Are at last well over .


Town .
These blank licences are wonderful commodious .
-- The clergy have a noble command , in being rangers of the park of matrimony  produce but a warrant , and they deliver a lady into your possession : but I have no quarrel with them , since they have put me into so good hands .


Foss .
I now proclaim a solemn suspension of arms between medicine and diseases .
Let distempers suspend their malignant influence , and powders , pills , and potions their operations .
Be this day sacred to my love .
I had rather hold this hand of thine , than a dutchess by the pulse .


Town .
And I this , than a hand of matadores .


Foss .
Who knows but your relations may dispute my title to your person ?
come , my dear , the seal of the matrimonial bond is consummation .


Town .
Alas !
what will become of me !


Foss .
Why are thy eyes fix'd on the ground ?
why so slow ?
and why this trembling ?


Town .
Ah !
heedless creature that I was , to quit all my relations , and trust myself alone in the hands of a strange man .


Foss .
Courage , thou best of my curiosities .
Know that in husband , is comprehended all relations  in me thou seest a fond father .


Town .
Old enough o ' my conscience .


[ Aside .


Foss .
You may , you must trust yourself with me .


Town .
Do with me as you please : Yet sure you can not so soon forget the office of the church .
Marriage is not to be undertaken wantonly , like brute beasts .
If you will transgress , the sin be upon your own head .


Foss .
Great indeed is thy virtue , and laudable is thy modesty .
Thou art a virgin , and I a philosopher  but learn , that no animal action , quatenus animal , is unbecoming of either of us .
But hold !
where am I going ?
Prithee , my dear , of what age art thou ?


Town .
Almost three and twenty .


Foss .
And I almost at my grand climacterick .
What occasion have I for a double-night at these years ?
She may be an Alcmena , but alas !
I am no thunderer .


[ Aside


Town .
You seem somewhat disturb'd  I hope you are well , Mr. Fossile .


Foss .
What business have I in the bed-chamber , when the symptoms of age are upon me ?
Yet hold , this is the famous corroborative of Crollius  in this vial are included sons and daughters .
Oh , for a draught of the aqua magnanimitatis for a vehicle !
fifty drops of liquid laudanum for her dose would but just put us upon a par .
Laudanum would settle the present ataxy of her animal spirits , and prevent her being too watchful .


[ aside


Enter a Servant .


Serv .
Sir , your pistachoe-porridge is ready .


[ Exit .


Foss .
Now I think of it , my dear  Venus , which is in the first degree of Capricorn , does not culminate till ten  an hour if astrology is not fallible , successful in generation .


Town .
I am all obedience , Sir .


Foss .
How shall I reward thee for so much Goodness ?
let our wedding as yet be a secret in the family .
In the mean time I 'll introduce my niece Phoebe Clinket to your acquaintance : but alas , the poor girl has a procidence of the pineal gland , which has occasioned a rupture in her understanding .
I took her into my house to regulate my oeconomy  but instead of puddings , she makes pastorals  or when she should be raising paste , is raising some ghost in a new tragedy .
In short , my house is haunted by all the underling players , broken booksellers , half-voic'd singing-masters , and disabled dancing-masters in town .
In a former will I had left her my estate  but I now resolve that heirs of my own begetting shall inherit .
Yonder she comes in her usual occupation .
Let us mark her a while .


Enter Clinket and her maid bearing a writing-desk on her back .
Clinket writing , her head dress stain'd with ink , and pens stuck in her hair .


Maid .
I had as good carry a raree-show about the streets .
Oh !
how my back akes !


Clink .
What are the labours of the back to those of the brain ?
thou scandal to the muses .
I have now lost a thought worth a folio , by thy impertinance .


Maid .
Have not I got a crick in my back already , that will make me good for nothing , with lifting your great books ?


Clink .
Folio 's , call them , and not great books , thou monster of impropriety : But have patience , and I will remember the three gallery-tickets I promis'd thee at my new tragedy .


Maid .
I shall never get my head-cloaths clear-starch'd at this rate .


Clink .
Thou destroyer of learning , thou worse than a book-worm  thou hast put me beyond all patience .
Remember how my lyrick ode bound about a tallow-candle  thy wrapping up snuff in an epigram  nay , the unworthy usage of my hymn to Apollo , filthy creature !
read me the last lines I writ upon the deluge , and take care to pronounce them as I taught you .


Maid .


Swell'd with a dropsy , sickly nature lies , And melting in a diabetes , dies .


[ Reads with an affected tone .


Clink .
Still without cadence !


Maid .
Swell'd with a dropsy --


Clink .
Hold .
I conceive --


The roaring seas o'er the tall woods have broke , And whales now perch upon the sturdy oak .


Roaring ?
stay .
Rumbling , roaring , rustling , no  raging seas .


[ Writing .


The raging seas o'er the tall woods have broke , Now perch , thou whale , upon the sturdy oak .


Sturdy oak ?
no  steady , strong , strapping , stiff .
Stiff ?
no , stiff is too short .


FOSSILE and TOWNLEY come forward .


What feast for fish !
Oh too luxurious treat !
When hungry dolphins feed on butchers meat .


Foss .
Niece , why niece , niece ?
oh , Melpomene , thou goddess of tragedy , suspend thy influence for a moment , and suffer my niece to give me a rational answer .
This lady is a friend of mine  her present circumstances oblige her to take sanctuary in my house  treat her with the utmost civility .
Let the tea-table be made ready .


Clink .
Madam , excuse this absence of mind  my animal spirits had deserted the avenues of my senses , and retired to the recesses of the brain , to contemplate a beautiful idea .
I could not force the vagrant creatures back again into their posts , to move those parts of the body that express civility .


Town .
A rare affected creature this !
if I mistake not , flattery will make her an useful tool for my purpose .


[ Aside .


[ Exeunt Townley , Clinket , and Maid .


Foss .
Her jewels , her strong box , and all her things left behind !
if her uncle should discover her marriage , he may lay an embargo upon her goods .
-- I 'll send for them .


Enter a boy with a letter .


Boy .
This is the ho-ho-house .


Foss .
Child , whom dost thou want ?


Boy .
Mistress Townley 's ma-ma-maid .


Foss .
What is your business ?


Boy .
A l-l-letter .


Foss .
Who sent this letter ?


Boy .
O-o-one .


Foss .
Give it me , child .
An honest boy .
Give it me , and I 'll deliver it myself .
A very honest boy .


Boy .
So .


[ Exit boy .


Foss .
There are now no more secrets between us .
Man and wife are one .


` Madam , either I mistake the encouragement I have had , or I am to be happy to-night .
I hope the same person will compleat her good offices : I stand to articles .
The ring is a fine one  and I shall have the pleasure of putting it on the first time . '


This from your impatient , R. P .


In the name of Beelzebub , what is this ?
encouragement !
happy to-night !
same person !
good offices !
whom hast thou married , poor Fossile ?
couldst thou not still divert thyself with the spoils of quarries and coal-pits , thy serpents and thy salamanders , but thou must have a living monster too !
` sdeath !
what a jest shall I be to our club !
is there no rope among my curiosities ?
shall I turn her out of doors , and proclaim my infamy  or lock her up and bear my misfortunes ?
lock her up !
impossible .
One may shut up volatile spirits , pen up the air , confine bears , lyons and tygers , nay , keep even your gold : but a wanton wife , who can keep ?


Enter TOWNLEY .


Town .
Mrs. Clinket 's play is to be read this morning at the tea-table : will you come and divert yourself , Sir ?


Foss .
No : I want to be alone .


Town .
I hope my company is not troublesome already .
I am as yet a bride  not a wife .
[ sighs . ]
What means this sudden change ?
[ Aside . ]
Consider , Mr. Fossile , you want your natural rest : the bed would refresh you .
Let me sit by you .


Foss .
My head akes , and the bed always makes it worse .


Town .
Is it hereabouts ?


[ rubbing his temples .


Foss .
Too sure .


[ Turns from her .


Town .
Why so fretful , Mr. Fossile ?


Foss .
No , I 'll dissemble my passion , and pump her .
[ Aside . ]
Excess of joy , my dear , for my good fortune overcomes me .
I am somewhat vertiginous , I can hardly stand .


Town .
I hope I was ordain'd for thy support .


Foss .
My disorder now begins to dissipate : it was only a little flatulency , occasion'd by something hard of digestion .
But pray , my dear , did your uncle shut you up so close from the conversation of mankind ?


Town .
Sarsnet and Shock were my only company .


Foss .
A very prudent young woman this Sarsnet  she was undoubtedly a good and faithful friend in your solitude .


Town .
When it was her interest  but I made no intimacies with my chamber-maid .


Foss .
But was there no lover offer'd his service to a lady in distress .


Town .
Tongue , be upon thy guard : these questions must be design'd to trap me .
[ Aside . ]
A woman of my condition ca n't well escape importunity .


Foss .
What was the name of that disagreeable fellow , who , you told me , teaz'd you so ?


Town .
His name ?
I think he had a thousand names .
In one letter he was Myrtillo , in another Corydon , Alexis , and I do n't know what .


Enter SARSNET in haste to her mistress : He runs and embraces her with great earnestness .


Foss .
Dear Mrs. Sarsnet , how am I oblig'd to thee for thy services : thou hast made me happy beyond expression .
-- I shall find another letter upon her .


[ Aside .


[ He gets his hand into Sarsnet 's pocket , as searching for a letter .


[ Whenever Sarsnet goes to whisper her mistress , he gets between them .


Enter PTISAN .


Ptis .
Mrs. Colloquintida complains still of a dejection of appetite  she says that the genevre is too cold for her stomach .


Foss .
Give her a quieting draught  but let us not interrupt one another .
Good Mr. Ptisan , we are upon business .


[ Fossile gets between Sarsnet and Townley .


Ptis .
The colonel 's spitting is quite suppress'd .


Foss .
Give him a quieting draught .
Come to morrow , Mr. Ptisan  I can see no body till then .


Ptis .
Lady Varnish finds no benefit of the waters  for the pimple on the tip of her nose still continues .


Foss .
Give her a quieting draught .


Ptis .
Mrs. Prudentia 's tympany grows bigger and bigger .
What , no pearl cordial !
must I quiet them all ?


Foss .
Give them all quieting draughts , I say , or blister them all , as you please .
Your servant Mr. Ptisan .


Ptis .
But then lady Giddy 's vapours .
She calls her chamber-maids nymphs  for she fancies herself Diana , and her husband Acteon .


Foss .
I can attend no patient till to morrow .
Give her a quieting draught , I say .


[ Whenever Fossile goes to conduct Ptisan to the door , Sarsnet and Townley attempt to whisper  Fossile gets between them , and Ptisan takes that opportunity of coming back .


Ptis .
Then , sir , there is miss Chitty of the boarding-school has taken in no natural sustenance for this week , but a halfpeny worth of charcoal , and one of her mittens .


Foss .
Sarsnet , do you wait on Mr Ptisan to the door .
To morrow let my patients know I 'll visit round .


[ A knocking at the door .


Ptis .
Oh , Sir  here is a servant of the countess of Hippokekoana .
The emetick has over-wrought and she is in convulsions .


Foss .
This is unfortunate .
Then I must go .
Mr. Ptisan , my dear , has some business with me in private .
Retire into my closet a moment , and divert yourself with the pictures .
There lies your way , madam .


[ To Sarsnet .


[ Exit Townley at one door and Sarsnet at the other .


Mr. Ptisan , pray , do you run before , and tell them I am just coming .


[ Exit Ptisan .


All my distresses come on the neck of one another .
Should this fellow get to my bride before I have bedded her , in a collection of cuckolds , what a rarity should I make !
what shall I do ?
I 'll lock her up .
Lock up my bride ?
my pace and my honour demand it , and it shall be so .
[ Locks the door . ]
Thomas , Thomas !


Enter footman .


I dream 't last night I was robb'd .
The town is over-run with rogues .
Who knows but the rascal that sent the letter may be now in the house ?
[ Aside . ]
Look up the chimney , search all the dark closets , the coal hole , the flower-pots , and forget not the empty butt in the cellar .
Keep a strict watch at the door , and let no body in till my return .


[ Exit footman .
A noise at the closet-door .


( within . )
Who 's there ?
-- I 'm lock'd in .
Murder !
fire !


Foss .
Dear madam , I beg your pardon .


[ Unlocks the door .
Enter TOWNLEY . ]


'T is well you call'd .
I am so apt to lock this door  an action meerly mechanical , not spontaneous .


Town .
Your conduct , Mr. Fossile , for this quarter of an hour has been somewhat mysterious .
It has suggested to me what I almost blush to name  your locking me up , confirms this suspicion .
Pray speak plainly , what has caused this alteration ?


[ Fossile shews her the letter .


Is this all ?


[ Gives him the letter back .


Foss .
( reads ) Either I mistake the encouragement I have had .
What encouragement ?


Town .
From my uncle , -- if I must be your interpreter .


Foss .
Or I am to be happy to night .


Town .
To be married .
-- If there can be happiness in that state .


Foss .
I hope the same person .


Town .
Parson .
Only a word mis-pell'd .
-- Here 's jealousy for you !


Foss .
Will compleat her good offices .
A she-parson , I find !


Town .
He is a Welshman .
And the Welsh always say her instead of his .


Foss .
I stand to articles .


Town .
Of jointure .


Foss .
The ring is a fine one , and I shall have the pleasure of putting it on my self .


Town .
Who should put on the wedding-ring but the bridegroom .


Foss .
I beseech thee , pardon thy dear husband .
Love and jealousy are often companions , and excess of both had quite obnubilated the eyes of my understanding .


Town .
Barbarous man !
I could forgive thee , if thou hadst poison'd my father , debauch'd my sister , kill'd my lapdog  but to murder my reputation !


[ Weeps .


Foss .
Nay , I beseech thee , forgive me .


[ Kneels .


Town .
I do : but upon condition your jealous fit never returns .
To a jealous man a whisper is evidence , and a dream demonstration .
A civil letter makes him thoughtful , an innocent visit mad .
I shall try you , Mr. Fossile  for do n't think I 'll be deny'd company .


Foss .
Nay , prithee , my dear  I own I have abused thee .
But lest my marriage , and this simple story should take air in the neighbourhood , to morrow we will retire into the country together , till the secret is blown over .
I am call'd to a patient .
In less than half an hour I 'll be with you again , my dear .


[ Exit Fossile .


Town .
Plotwell 's letter had like to have ruin'd me .
'T was a neglect in me , not to intrust him with the secret of my marriage .
A jealous bridegroom !
every poison has its antidote  as credulity is the cause , so it shall be the cure of his jealousy .
To morrow I must be spirited away into the country  I 'll immediately let Plotwell know of my distress : and this little time with opportunity , even on his wedding-day , shall finish him a compleat husband .
Intrigue assist me !
and I 'll act a revenge that might have been worthy the most celebrated wife in Boccace .


Enter PLOTWELL and CLINKET .


Hah !
Plotwell !
which way got he hither ?
I must caution him to be upon his guard .


Plot .
Madam , I am agreeably surpriz'd to find you here .


Town .
Me , Sir ?
you are certainly mistaken , for I do n't remember I ever saw you before .


Plot .
Madam , I beg your pardon .
How like a truth sounds a lye from the tongue of a fine woman .


[ Aside .


Clink .
This , Madam , is Mr. Plotwell  a Gentleman who is so infinitely obliging , as to introduce my play on the theatre , by fathering the unworthy issue of my muse , at the reading it this morning .


Plot .
I should be proud , madam , to be a real father to any of your productions .


Clink .
Mighty just .
Ha , ha , ha .
You know , Mr. Plotwell , that both a parrot and a player can utter human sounds , but we allow neither of them to be a judge of wit .
Yet some of those people have had the assurance to deny almost all my performances the privilege of being acted .
Ah !
what a Goût de travers rules the understanding of the illiterate !


Plot .
There are some , madam , that nauseate the smell of a rose .


[ Whenever Plotwell and Townley endeavour to talk , she interrupts them .


Clink .
If this piece be not rais'd to the sublime , let me henceforth be stigmatiz'd as a reptile in the dust of mediocrity .
I am persuaded , Sir , your adopted child will do you no dishonour .


Town .
Pray , madam , what is the subject ?


Clink .
Oh !
beyond every thing .
So adapted for tragical machines !
so proper to excite the passions !
not in the least encumber'd with episodes !
the vraysemblance and the miraculous are linkt together with such propriety .


Town .
But the subject , madam ?


Clink .
The universal Deluge , I chose that of Deucalion and Pyrrha , because neither our stage nor actors are hallow'd enough for sacred story .


Plot .
But , madam --


[ To Townley .


Clink .
What just occasion for noble description !
these players are exceeding dilatory .


-- In the mean time , Sir , shall I be oblig'd to you and this lady for the rehearsal of a scene that I have been just touching up with some lively strokes .


Town .
I dare assure you , madam , it will be a pleasure to us both .
I 'll take this occasion to inform you of my present circumstances .


[ To Plotwell .


Clink .
Imagine Deucalion and Pyrrha in their boat .
They pass by a promontory , where stands prince Hæmon a former lover of Pyrrah 's , ready to be swallowed up by the devouring flood .
She presses her husband to take him into the boat .
Your part , Sir , is Hæmon  the lady personates Pyrrha  and I represent Deucalion .
To you , Sir .


[ Gives Plotwell the manuscript .


Plot .
What ho , there sculler !


[ reads .


Town .
-- Hæmon !


Plot .
-- Yes , 't is Hæmon !


Town .


Thou seest me now sail'd from my former lodgings , Beneath a husband 's ark  yet fain I would reward Thy proffer'd love .
But Hæmon , ah , I fear Tomorrow 's eve will hide me in the country .


Clink .
Not a syllable in the part !
wrong , all wrong !


Plot .


Through all the town , with diligent enquiries , I sought my Pyrrha --


Clink .
Beyond all patience !
the part , Sir , lies before you  you are never to perplex the drama with speeches extempore .


Plot .
Madam , 't is what the top players often do .


Town .
Though love denies , companion bids me save thee .


[ Plotwell kisses her .


Clink .
Fye , Mr. Plotwell  this is against all the decorum of the stage  I will no more allow the libertinism of lip-embraces than the barbarity of killing on the stage  your best tragedians , like the ladies of quality in a visit , never turn beyond the back-part of the cheek to a salute , as thus Mr. Plotwell .


[ Kisses Plotwell .


Plot .
I do n't find in Aristotle any precept against killing .


Clink .
Yet I would not stand upon the brink of an indecorum .


Plot .
True , madam , the finishing stroke of love and revenge should never shock the eyes of an audience .
But I look upon a kiss in a comedy to be upon a par with a box on the ear in a tragedy , which is frequently given and taken by your best authors .


Clink .
Mighty just !
for a lady can no more put up a kiss than a gentleman a box on the ear .
Take my muse , Sir , into your protection [ Gives him her play ] the players I see are here .
Your personating the author will infallibly introduce my play on the stage , and spite of their prejudice , make the theatre ring with applause , and teach even that injudicious Canaille to know their own interest .


Exit .


ACT II .


PLOTWELL , TOWNLEY , CLINKET , with Sir TREMENDOUS and two Players , discovered seated round a Table .


Plot .
Gentlemen , this lady who smiles on my performances , has permitted me to introduce you and my tragedy to her tea-table .


Clink .
Gentlemen , you do me honour .


1st Play .
Suffer us , Sir , to recommend to your acquaintance , the famous Sir Tremendous , the greatest critick of our age .


Plot .
Sir Tremendous , I rejoice at your presence  though no lady that has an antipathy , so sweats at a cat as some authors at a critick .
Sir Tremendous , madam , is a Gentleman who can instruct the town to dislike what has pleased them , and to be pleased with what they disliked .


Sir Trem .
Alas !
what signifies one good palate when the taste of the whole town is viciated .
There is not in all this Sodom of ignorance ten righteous criticks , who do not judge things backward ,


Clink .
I perfectly agree with Sir Tremendous : your modern tragedies are such egregious stuff , they neither move terror nor pity .


Plot .
Yes , madam , the pity of the audience on the first night , and the terror of the author for the third .
Sir Tremendous 's plays indeed have rais'd a sublimer passion , astonishment .


Clink .
I perceive here will be a wit-combat between these beaux-esprits .
Prue , be sure you set down all the similes .


Prue retires to the back part of the stage with pen and ink .


Sir Trem .
The subjects of most modern plays are as ill chosen as --


Plotw .
The patrons of their dedications .


[ Clink .
makes signs to Prue .


Sir Trem .
Their plots as shallow --


Plotw .
As those of bad poets against new plays


Sir Trem .
Their episodes as little of a piece to the main action , as --


Clink .
A black gown with a pink-colour'd petticoat .
Mark that , Prue .


[ Aside .


Sir Trem .
Their sentiments are so very delicate --


Plotw .
That like whipt syllabub they are lost before they are tasted .


Sir Trem .
Their diction so low , that -- that --


Plotw .
Why , that their friends are forced to call it simplicity .


1st Play .
Sir to the play if you please .


2d Play .
We have a rehearsal this morning .


Sir Trem .
And then their thefts are so open --


Plotw .
that the very French taylors can discover them .


Sir Trem .
O what felony from the ancients !
what petty larceny from the moderns !
there is the famous Ephigenia of Racine , he stole his Agamemnon from Seneca , who stole it from Euripides , who stole it from Homer , who stole it from all the ancients before him .
In short there is nothing so execrable as our most taking tragedies .


1st Play .
O !
but the immortal Shakespeare , Sir .


Sir Trem .
He had no judgnent .


2d Play .
The famous ben Johmson !


Clink .
Dry .


1st Play .
The tender Otway !


Sir Trem .
Incorrect .


2d Play .
Etheridge !


Clink .
Mere chit-chat .


1st Play .
Dryden !


Sir Trem .
Nothing but a knack of versifying .


Clink .
Ah !
dear Sir Tremendous , there is that delicatesse in your sentiments !


Sir Trem .
Ah madam !
there is that justness in your notions !


Clink .
I am so much charm'd with your manly penetration !


Sir Trem .
I with your profound capacity !


Clink .
That I am not able --


Sir Trem .
That it is impossible --


Clink .
To conceive --


Sir Trem .
To express --


Clink .
With what delight I embrace --


Sir Trem .
With what pleasure I enter into --


Clink .
Your ideas , most learned Sir Tremendous !


Sir Trem .
Your sentiments , most divine Mrs. Clinket .


2d Play .
The play , for heaven 's sake , the play .


[ A tea-table brought in . ]


Clink .
This finish'd drama is too good for an age like this .


Plotw .
The Universal Deluge , or the tragedy of Deucalion and Pyrrha .


[ Reads


Clink .
Mr. Plotwell , I will not be deny'd the pleasure of reading it , you will pardon me .


1st Play .
The deluge !
the subject seems to be too recherche .


Clink .
A subject untouch'd either by ancients or moderns , in which are terror and pity in perfection .


1st Play .
The stage will never bear it .
Can you suppose , Sir , that a box of ladies will sit three hours to see a rainy day , and a feather in a storm  make your best of it , I know it can be nothing else .


2d Play .
If you please , madam , let us hear how it opens .


Clink .
[ reads . ]
The scene opens and discovers the heavens cloudy .
A prodigious shower of rain .
At a distance appears the top of the mountain Parnassus  all the fields beneath are over-flowed  there are seen cattle and men swimming .
The tops of steeples rise above the flood , with men and women perching on their weathercocks --


Sir Trem .
Begging your pardon , Sir , I believe it can be proved , that weather-cocks are of a modern invention .
Besides , if stones were dissolved , as a late philosopher hath proved , how could steeples stand ?


Plot .
I do n't insist upon trifles .
Strike it out .


Clink .
Strike it out !
consider what you do .
In this they strike at the very foundation of the drama .
Do n't almost all the persons of your second act start out of stones that Deucalion and Pyrrha threw behind them ?
This cavil is levell'd at the whole system of the reparation of human race .


1st Play .
Then the shower is absurd .


Clink .
Why should not this gentleman rain , as well as other authors snow and thunder ?
-- -- [ reads . ]
Enter Deucalion in a sort of waterman 's habit , leading his wife Pyrrha to a boat -- Her first distress is about her going back to fetch a casket of jewels .
Mind , how he imitates your great authors .
The first speech has all the fire of Lee .


Tho ' heav'n wrings all the sponges of the sky , And pours down clouds , at once each cloud a sea .
Not the spring tides --


Sir Trem .
There were no spring tides in the Mediteranean , and consequently Deucalion could not make that simile .


Clink .
A man of Deucalion 's quality might have travelled beyond the Mediteranean , and so your objection is answered .
Observe , Sir Tremendous , the tenderness of Otway , in this answer of Pyrrha .


-------------------- Why do the stays Taper my waist , but for thy circling arms ?


Sir Trem .
Ah !
Anachronisms !
Stays are a modern habit , and the whole scene is monstrous , and against the rules of tragedy .


Plot .
I submit Sir , -- out with it .


Clink .
Were the play mine , you should gash my flesh , mangle my face , any thing sooner than scratch my play .


Plot .
Blot and insert wherever you please -- I submit myself to your judgment .


Plotwell rises and discourses apart with Townley .


Sir Trem .
Madam , nonsense and I have been at variance from my cradle , it sets my understanding on edge .


2d Play .
Indeed , madam , with submission , and I think I have some experience of the stage , this play will hardly take .


Clink .
The worst lines of it would be sufficiently clapt , if it had been writ by a known author , or recommended by one .


Sir Trem .
Between you and I , madam , who understand better things , this gentleman knows nothing of poetry .


1st Play .
The gentleman may be an honest man , but he is a damn'd writer , and it neither can take , nor ought to take .


Sir Trem .
If you are the gentleman 's friend , and value his reputation , advise him to burn it .


Clink .
What struggles has an unknown author to vanquish prejudice !
Suppose this play acts but six nights , his next may play twenty .
Encourage a young author , I know it will be your interest .


2d Play .
I would sooner give five hundred pounds than bring some plays on the stage  an audience little considers whether 't is the author or the actor that is hiss'd , our character suffers .


1st Play .
Damn our character -- We shall lose money by it .


Clink .
I 'll deposit a sum myself upon the success of it .
Well , since it is to be play'd -- I will prevail upon him to strike out some few things .
-- Take the play , Sir Tremendous .


Sir Tremendous reads in a muttering tone .


Sir Trem .
Absurd to the last degree [ strikes out . ]
palpable nonsense !
[ strikes out . ]


Clink .
What all those lines !
spare those for a lady 's sake , for those indeed , I gave him .


Sir Trem .
Such stuff !
[ strikes out . ]
abominable !
[ strikes out . ]
most execrable !


1st Play .
This thought must out .


2d Play .
Madam , with submission , this metaphor .


1st Play .
This whole speech .


Sir Trem .
The Fable !


Clink .
To you I answer , --


1st Play .
The characters !


Clink .
To you I answer --


Sir Trem .
The diction !


Clink .
And to you -- Ah , hold , hold , -- I 'm butcher'd , I 'm massacred .
For mercy 's sake !
murder , murder !
ah !

Enter Fossile peeping at the door .


Foss .
My house turn'd to a stage !
and my bride playing her part too !
What will become of me ?
but I 'll know the bottom of all this , [ aside . ]
I am surprized to see so many patients here so early .
What is your distemper , Sir ?


1st Play .
The cholic , Sir , by a surfeit of green tea and damn'd verses .


Foss .
Your pulse is very high , madam .
[ To Townley . ]
You sympathize , I perceive , for yours is somewhat feverish .
[ To Plotwell . ]
But I believe I shall be able to put off the fit for this time .
And as for you , niece , you have got the poetical itch , and are possess'd with nine devils , your nine muses  and thus I commit them and their works to the flames .
[ Takes up a heap of papers and flings them into the fire . ]


Clink .
Ah !
I am an undone woman .


Plot .
Has he burnt any bank-bills , or a new Mechlin head-dress ?


Clink .
My works !
my works !


1st Play .
Has he destroyed the writings of an estate , or your billet doux ?


Clink .
A Pindarick ode !
five similes !
and half an epilogue !


2d Play .
Has he thrown a new fan or your pearl necklace into the flames ?


Clink .
Worse , worse !
The tag of the acts of a new comedy !
a prologue sent by a person of quality three copies of recommendatory verses !
and two Greek mottos !


Foss .
Gentlemen , if you please to walk out .


2d Play .
You shall have our positive answer concerning your tragedy , madam , in an hour or two .


[ Exit Sir Tremendous , Plotwell and Players .


Foss .
Though this affair looks but ill  yet I will not be over-rash : What says Lybanius ? '
A false accusation often recoils upon the accuser  ' and I have suffered already by too great precipitation .


[ Exit Fossile .


Enter SARSNET .


Town .
A narrow escape , Sarsnet !
Plotwells letter was intercepted and read by my husband .


Sars .
I tremble every joint of me .
How came you off ?


Town .
Invention flow'd , I ly'd , he believ'd .
True wife , true husband !


Sars .
I have often warned you , madam , against this superfluity of gallants  you ought at least to have clear'd all mortgages upon your person before you leas'd it out for life .
Then , besides Plotwell , you are every moment in danger of Underplot , who attends on Plotwell like his shadow  he is unlucky enough to stumble upon your husband , and then I 'm sure his shatterbrains would undo us at once .


Town .
Thy wit and industry , Sarsnet , must help me out .
To day is mine , to morrow is my husband 's .


Sars .
But some speedy method must be thought of , to prevent your letters from falling into his hands .


Town .
I can put no confidence in my landlady Mrs. Chambers , since our quarrel at parting .
So I have given orders to her maid to direct all letters and messages hither , and I have plac'd my own trusty servant Hugh at the door to receive them -- but see , yonder comes my husband , I 'll retire to my closet .


[ Exit Townley and Sarsnet .


Enter FOSSILE .


Foss .
O marriage , thou bitterest of potions , and thou strongest of astringents .
This Plotwell that I found talking with her must certainly be the person that sent the letter .
But if I have a Bristol stone put upon me instead of a diamond , why should I by experiments spoil its lustre ?
She is handsome , that is certain .
Could I but keep her to myself for the future !
Cuckoldom is an accute case , it is quickly over  when it takes place , it admits of no remedy but palliatives .
-- Be it how it will , while my marriage is a secret --


Within .
Bless the noble doctor Fossile and his honourable lady .
The city musick are come to wish him much joy of his marriage .
[ A flourish of fiddles .


Foss .
Joy and marriage  never were two words so coupled .


Within .
Much happiness attend the learned doctor Fossile and his worthy and virtuous lady .
The drums and trumpets of his majesty 's guards are come to salute him --


[ A flourish of Drums and Trumpets .


Foss .
Ah , Fossile !
wretched Fossile !
into what state hast thou brought thy self !
thy disgrace proclaim'd by beat of drum !
New married men are treated like those bit by a Tarantula , both must have musick : But where are the notes that can expell a wife !


Exit .


ACT III .


Enter FOSSILE in a footman 's cloaths ,


Foss .
A Special dog  this footman of my wife 's !
as mercenary as the porter of a first minister !
Why should she place him as a centinal at my door ?
unquestionably , to carry on her intrigues .
Why did I bribe him to lend me his livery ?
to discover those intrigues .
And now , O wretched Fossile , thou hast debas'd thyself into the low character of a footman .
What then ?
gods and demi gods have assum'd viler shapes : they , to make a cuckold  I , to prove myself one .
Why then should my metamorphosis be more shameful , when my purpose is more honest ?


[ Knocking at the door , enter footman . ]


Foot .
Ay , this is her livery .
Friend , give this to your mistress .


[ Gives a letter to Fossile and exit . ]


Fossile .
[ reads ]


` Madam , you have jilted me .
What I gave you cost me dear  what you might have given me , would have cost you nothing .
You shall use my next present with more respect .
I presented you a fine snuff-box  you gave it to that coxcomb Underplot , and Underplot gave it to my wife .
Judge of my surprise .


` Freeman . '


A fine circulation of a snuff-box !
in time I shall have the rarest of my shells set off with gold hinges , to make presents to all the fops about town .
My Conchæ Veneris  and perhaps , even my Nautilus .


A knocking at the door .
Enter an old woman .


Old Wom .
Can I speak with your good mistress , honest friend ?


Fos .
No , she 's busy .


Old Wom .
Madam Wyburn presents her service and has sent this letter .


[ Exit .


Fossile .
[ reads ]


` Being taken up with waiting upon merchants ladies this morning , I have sent to acquaint you , my dear sweet Mrs. Townley , that the alderman agrees to every thing but putting away his wife , which he says is not decent at that end of the town .
He desires a meeting this evening . '


Postscript .


` He does not like the grocer 's wife at all . '


Bless me !
what a libidinous age we live in !
neither his own wife !
nor the grocer 's wife !
Will people like nobody 's wife but mine !

Enter a ragged fellow with a letter .


Foot .
My master is at present under a cloud -- He begs you will deliver this letter to your lady .


[ Exit .


Foss .
[ reads ]


' I am reduced by your favours to ask the thing I formerly deny'd  that you would entertain me as a husband , who can no longer keep you as a mistress .


` Charles Bat . '


Why did I part with this fellow ?
This was a proposal indeed , to make both me and himself happy at once !
He shall have her , and a twelve-month 's fees into the bargain .
Where shall I find him ?
-- Why was the mistress of all mankind unknown to thee alone ?
Why is nature so dark in our greatest concerns ?
Why are there no external symptoms of defloration , nor any pathognomick of the loss of virginity but a big belly ?
Why has not lewdness its tokens like the plague ?
Why must a man know rain by the aking of his corns , and have no prognostick of what is of infinitely greater moment , cuckoldom ?
Or if there are any marks of chastity , why is the enquiry allowed only to Turks and Jews , and denyed to Christians ?
O Townley , Townley !
once to me the fragrant rose  now aloes , wormwood and snake-root !
but I must not be seen .


As Townley and Sarsnet enter , Fossile sneaks off .


Town .
Sarsnet , we are betray'd .
I have discovered my husband posted at the door in Hugh 's livery , he has intercepted all my letters .
I immediately writ this , which is the only thing that can bring us off .
Run this moment to Plotwell , get him to copy it , and send it directed to me by his own servant with the utmost expedition .
He is now at the chocolate-house in the next street .


Sars .
I fly , madam  but how will you disengage yourself from the affair with Underplot ?


Town .
Leave it to me .
Though he wants sense , he 's handsome , and I like the fellow  and if he is lucky enough to come in my husband 's absence .
-- But prithee Sarsenet make haste .


[ Exit Townley and Sarsenet , upon which Fossile re-enters , to him Underplot . ]


Underp .
Harke'e , friend .
I never talk with one of your coat , but I first tip him .


Foss .
Behold the lucre of a pimp !
Between the pox abroad , and my plague at home , I find a man may never want fees .
[ aside . ]
Your honour 's commands , I pray .
I long to serve you .


Underp .
Ah , boy !
thou hast a rare mistress for vails .
Come I know thou art a sly dog  can ` st thou introduce me to her for a moment 's conversation ?


Foss .
Impossible .


Underp .
What , still impossible ?


[ Gives more money .


Foss .
Still impossible .


Underp .
Poh , pox .
But prithee , friend , by the by , is there any thing in this report that she is marry'd to the doctor here ?


Foss .
I am afraid there is something in it .


Underp .
What a spirit does a jealous husband give to an intrigue !
Pray , is he not a most egregious silly animal ?


Foss .
Not exceeding wise indeed ,


Underp , Rich ?


Foss .
He has money .


Underp .
That will save the expence of her gallants .
Old ?


Foss .
Ay , too old , heaven knows .


Underp .
How came it into the puppy 's head to marry ?


Foss .
By the instigation of Satan .


Underp .
I 'll help the old fool to an heir .


Foss .
No doubt o n't .
If the whole town can do it , he will not want one .


[ Aside .


Underp .
Come , prithee deal freely with me , Has Plotwell been here since the wedding ?


Foss .
He has !
too sure : [ aside . ]
He 's a dangerous rival to you  if you have a mind to succeed , keep a strict watch upon him , that he may not get admittance before you .


Underp .
Well since thou hast shown thyself so much my friend , I 'll let thee into a secret .
Plotwell and I no sooner heard of the wedding , but we made a bett of a hundred guineas , who should dub the doctor first .
Remember you go twenty pieces with me .


Foss .
But here is some body coming .
Away you are sure of my interest .


[ Exit Underplot .


Foss .
This was well judg'd .
I have a small territory coveted by two rival potentates .
It is profound policy to make them watch one the other , and so keep the ballance of power in my own hands .
Certainly nothing so improves one 's politicks , as to have a coquet to on ` es wife ,


Enter a footman with a letter ,


Foot .
This is for your lady , Deliver it safe into her own hands .


[ Exit Footman .


Fos .

` Know , cruel woman , I have discovered the secret of your marriage  you shall have all the plague of a jealous husband , without the pleasure of giving him cause .
I have this morning counterfeited billetdoux and letters from bawds  nay , I have sent pimps  some of which , I hope , are fallen into your old coxcomb 's hands .
If you deny me the pleasure of tipping him a real cuckold , at least , I 'll have the resentment to make him an imaginary one .
Know that this is not the hundredth part of the revenge that shall be executed upon thee , by R. P. '


Town .
[ peeping . ]
So .
The letter works as I would have it .


[ Aside .


Foss .
How true is that saying of the philosopher !
` We only know , that we know nothing . '
The eruption of those horns which seem'd to make so strong a push is now suppress'd .
Is the mystery of all these letters nothing but the revenge of a disappointed lover ?
The hand and seal are just the same with the Welchman 's that I intercepted a while ago .
Truly , these Welch are a hot revengeful people .
My wife may be virtuous  she may not .
Prevention is the safest method with diseases and intrigues .
Women are wanton , husbands weak , bawds busy , opportunities dangerous , gallants eager  therefore it behoves honest men to be watchful .
But here comes my Wife , I must hide myself  for should I be detected , she might have a just cause of complaint for my impertinent curiosity .


Exit Fossi .


Enter TOWNLEY  and to her SARSNET at the other door .


Sars .
Your orders , madam , have been executed to a tittle , and I hope with success .


Town .
Extremely well .
Just as we could have wish'd .
But I ca n't forgive that rascal Hugh .
To turn him away would be dangerous .
We will rather take the advantage of the confidence my husband has in him .
Leave the husband to me , and do you discipline the footman .
Such early curiosity must be crush'd in the bud .

Foss .
Nay , prithee , dearee , judge not rashly .
My character is establish'd in the world .
There lives not a more sober , chaste , and virtuous person than doctor Fossile .


Town .
Then why this disguise ?


Foss , Since it must come out  ha , ha , ha , only a frolick on my wedding day between Hugh and I .
We had a mind to exhibit a little mummery .


Clink .
What joy arises in my soul to see my uncle in a dramatick character !
Since your humour lead you to the drama , uncle , why would you not consult a relative muse in your own family ?
I have always used you as my physician  and why should not you use me as your poet ?


Foss , Prithee , dear , leave me a moment .
This is a scandal to my gravity .
I 'll be with you , as my self , immediately .


[ Exeunt omnes , except Fossile and Hugh .
As they are changing habits , Fossile says ,

Hugh .
Worthy doctor , you may rely upon my honour .

I have betray'd my mistress .
My conscience flies in my face , and I can ease it noway but by betraying my master .

Plot .
De famous university of Cracow in Polonia minor .

Plot .
Vat of dat ?

Foss .
By what operations ?


Plot .
By calcination  reverberation  purification  sublimation  amalgamation  precipitation  volitilization .


Foss .
Have a care what you assert .
The volitilization of gold is not an obvious process .
It is by great elegance of speech called , fortitudo fortitudinis fortissima .


Plot .
I need not acquaint de illustrious doctor Fossile , dat all de metals be but unripe gold .


Foss .
Spoken like a philosopher , And therefore there should be an act of parliament against digging of lead mines , as against felling young timber .
But inform me , Sir , what might be your menstruum , snow-water , or May-dew ?


Plot .
Snow-vater .


Foss .

Snow is the universal pickle of nature for the preservation of her productions in the hyemal season .


Plot .
If you will go your self , and not trust de servant , to fetch some of de right Thames sand dat be below de bridge , I will show you de naked Diana in your study before I go hence .


Foss .
Perhaps you might .
I am not at present dispos'd for experiments .


Plot .
This bite wont take to send him out of the way , I 'll change my subject .
[ Aside . ]
Do you deal in longitudes , Sir ?


Foss .
I deal not in impossibilities .
I search only for the grand elixir .

Vat do you tink of de new metode of fluxion ?


Foss .
I know no other but my mercury .


Plot .
Ha , ha .
Me mean de fluxion of de quantity .


Foss .
The greatest quantity I ever knew , was three quarts a day .


Plot .
Be dere any secret in the hydrology , zoology , minerology , hydraulicks , acausticks , pneumaticks , logarithmatechny , dat you do want de explanation of ?


Foss .
This is all out of my way .
Do you know of any hermaphrodites , monstrous twins , antediluvivian shells , bones , and vegetables ?


Plot .
Vat tink you of an antediluvian knife , spoon , and fork , with the mark of Tubal Cain in Hebrew , dug out of the mine of Babylon ?


Foss .
Of what dimensions , I pray , Sir ?


Plot .
De spoon be bigger dan de modern ladle  de fork , like de great fire-fork  and de knife , like de cleaver .


Foss .
Bless me !
this shows the stature and magnitude of those antidiluvians !


Plot .
To make you convinced that I tell not de lie , dey are in de Turkey ship at Vapping , just going to be disposed of .

But because me vil have de fair correspondence with de illustrious doctor Fossile , me vil not deny dat Orpheus and me had near run de same fate for different reason .
I was hunted out of my country by de general insurrection of de women .


Foss .
How so pray ?


Plot .
Because me have prepare a certain liquor which discover whether a woman be a virgin or no .

Dere it is , Sir .
It be commonly called de Lapis Lydius Virginitatis , or touch-stone of virginity .


[ gives him a vial .


Foss .
It has the smell of your common hart 's - horn .
But all your volatile spirits have a near resemblance .


Plot .
Right , Sir .
De distillation be made from the Hippomanes of a young mare .
When a deflower'd virgin take ten drops , she will faint and sneeze , and de large red spot appear on the cheek  which we call de spot of infamy .
All de young bridegroom make de experiment .
De archbishop did make obligation to de nun to take it every ninth month .

where can I repose a little ?
I was taken suddenly .
Ah !

[ Fossile feels his pulse .

[ aside .


Foss .
What are your symptoms , Sir ?
a very tempestuous pulse , I profess !


Underp .
Violent head-ach , ah !
ah !


Foss .
All this proceeds from the fumes of the kitchen , the stomachic digester wants reparation for the better concoction of your aliment : But , Sir , is your pain pungitive , tensive , gravitive , or pulsatory ?


Plot .
All together , ah !


Foss .
Impossible Sir  but I have an eminent physician now in the house , he shall consult .
Doctor Lubomirski , here is a person in a most violent cephalalgy , a terrible case !

Foss .
Your dolor proceeds from a frigid intemperies of the brain , a strong disease !
the enemy has invaded the very citadel of your microcosm , the magazine of your vital functions  he has set down before it  yet there seems to be a good garrison of vital spirits , and we do n't question to be able to defend it .


Plot .
Ve will cannonade de enemy with pills , bombard him wid de bolus , blow him up with volatiles , fill up the trenches wid de large innundation of apozems , and dislodge him wid de stink pot  let de apotecary bring up de artillery of medicine immediately .


Foss .
True , we might unload the stomach by gentle emeticks , and the intestines by clysters stimulative , carminative , and emollient , with strong hydroticks , quiet the spasms of the viscera by paregoricks , draw off the stagnant blood by deep scarrifications , and depurate its fæculencies by volatiles  after this , let there be numerous blisters and potential cauteries -- I consult my patient 's ease  I am against much physick -- He faints , he is apoplectic , bleed him this moment .

[ starts up . ]
I know you , Plotwell , and was I not oblig'd by honour and friendship , I 'd expose you to the doctor .


[ aside to Plotwell .


Plot .
Very lunatick , mad , fetch me de cord to make de tie upon de leg and de arm , take off thirty ounces of blood , and den plunge him into de cold bath .


Foss .
Your judgment , doctor Lubomirski , is excellent , I will call my servants to assist us .


Underp .
Hearke'e , old put  I came to take your advice , and not that French son of a whore 's scarrifications  and so plague take you both .


[ Exit Underplot and Hugh .


ACT IV .


Enter Dr. FOSSILE , and PLOTWELL .


Foss .
Doctor Lubomirski , this vial that you have intrusted into my custody , shall be with acknowledgment return'd after a few experiments  I must crave your indulgence  diseases , you know , Sir , are impertinent , and will tie themselves to no hours , poor lady Hyppokekoana !


Plot .
Ah Sir !
I beg your pardon , if you make visit to de patient , me will divert myself in your study till you make return .


Foss .
That can not be , I have a lady just coming to consult me in a case of secrecy .


Plot .
Have you not de wife ?
me will make conversation wid de ladies till you come .


Foss .
They see no company in the morning , they are all in deshabilleé  most learned doctor Lubomirski , your humble servant .


Plot .
Most illustrious doctor Fossile , me be , with de profoundest adoration


Foss .
With the greatest admiration


Plot .
Your most humble


Foss .
Most obedient servant .


Plot .
Ah , Monsieur , point de ceremonie .


[ Exit Plotwell .


Enter HUGH .


Foss .
Hugh , bring me a pint of sack  let your mistress know I want to see her .
Take care that her orders be obey'd , and that her trunks and boxes be immediately brought hither .
Sarset will give you directions .


[ Exit Hugh .
Fossile sits down on a couch .


Ah Fossile !
if the cares of two hours of a married life have so reduc'd thee , how long can ` st thou hold out !
to watch a wife all day , and have her wake thee all night !
` twill never do .
The fitigue of three fevers , six small poxes , and five great ones , is nothing to that of one wife .
Now for my touch-stone  I will try it upon her presently .
If she bear it to day -- I am afraid she will bear it to morrow too .


Enter Hugh with a bottle of sack , and after him Townley .
Hugh gives the bottle and glass to Fossile and exit .


Sit down by me , my dear , I was going to refresh myself with a glass of canary .
You look pale .
It will do you good .


Town .
Faugh .
Wine in the morning !


[ Fossile drinks and fills again , and drops some of the liquor into the glass . ]


What is the meaning of this ?
am I to be poison'd .


[ aside .


Foss .
You must drink it .
Sack is sacred to Hymen  of it is made the nuptial posset .


Town .
Do n't press me , Mr. Fossile , I nauseate it .
It smells strangely .
There is something in it .


Foss .
An ill symptom !
she ca n't bear the smell .
[ aside . ]
Pray , my dear , oblige me .


Town .
I 'm for none of your flops .
I 'll fill myself .


Foss .
I must own , I have put some restorative drops in it , which are excellent .
I may drink it safely .
[ aside . ]
[ drinks . ]
The next glass I prepare for you .


[ Fills , and powers some drops in .


[ Townley drinks .
Fossile runs behind to support her  then pores upon her cheek , and touches it with his finger .


Town .
Your insolence is insupportable .
'T was but this moment you suspected my virtue  and now my complexion .
Put on your spectacles .
No red was ever laid upon these cheeks .
I 'll fly thee , and die a maid , rather than live under the same roof with jealousy and caprice .


Foss .
O thou spotless innocence !
I can not refrain tears of joy .
Forgive me , and I 'll tell thee all .
These drops have been a secret in our family for many years .
They are call'd the touch-stone of virginity .
The males administer it to the brides on their wedding-day  and by its virtue have ascertain'd the honour of the Fossiles from generation to generation .
There are family customs , which it is almost impious to neglect .


Town .
Had you married a person of doubtful reputation -- But me , Mr. Fossile !


Foss .
I did not indeed suspect thee .
But my mother obliged me to this experiment with her dying words -- My wife is chaste : And to preserve her so , 't is necessary that I have none but chaste servants about her .
I 'll make the experiment on all my female domesticks .
[ aside . ]
I will now , my dear , in thy presence , put all my family to the trial .
Here !
bid my niece , and all the maid-servants come before me .


[ Calling out .


Enter Clinket , Prue , and Servants .


Give ear , all ye virgins : We make proclamation in the name of the chaste Diana , being resolv'd to make a solemn essay of the virtue , virginity , and chastity of all within our walls .
We therefore advise , warn and precaution all spinsters , who know themselves blemish'd , not on any pretence whatsoever to taste these our drops , which will manifest their shame to the world by visible tokens .


Clink .
I abominate all kind of drops .
They interrupt the series of ideas .
But have the any power over the virgin 's dreams , thoughts , and private meditations ?


Foss .
No .
They do not affect the motus Primo-primi , or intentions  only actualities , niece .


Clink .
Then give it me .
I can drink as freely of it as of the waters of Helicon .
My love was always Platonick .


[ drinks .


Foss .
Yet I have known a Platonick lady lodge at a mid wife 's .


[ Fossile offers it round . ]


1st Wom .
I never take physick .


Foss .
That 's one .
Stand there .
My niece professes herself a Platonick .
You are rather a Cartesian .


Clink .
Ah dear uncle !
how do the Platonicks and Cartesians differ .


Foss .
The Platonicks are for idea 's , the Cartesians for matter and motion .


Town .
Mr. Fossile , you are too severe .


2d Wom .
I am not a-dry .


[ curtsies .


Foss .
There 's two .
Stand there .


Prue .
My mistress can answer for me .
She has taken it .


Foss .
She has .
But however stand there , among the Cartesians .


3d Wom .
My innocence would protect me , though I trod over red-hot iron .
Give me a brimmer .


[ She takes a mouthful and spits it out again . ]


Foss .
'T was a presumptuous thing to gargle with it : but however , madam , if you please -- walk among the Cartesians .


[ Two young wenches run away .


Clink .
Prue , follow me .
I have just found a rhime for my Pindarick .


[ They all sneak off .


Fos .
All gone !
what no more ladies here ?
no more ladies !
[ looking to the audience , ] O that I had but a boarding-school , or a middle gallery !


Enter Sarsnet , follow'd by two porters bearing a chest .


Set down the things here : there is no occasion for carrying them up stairs , since they are to be sent into the country to morrow .


[ Exit porters .


What have I done ?
My marriage , these confounded whimsies , and doctor Lubomirski , have made me quite forget poor lady Hippokekoana .
She was in convulsions , and I am afraid dead by this time .


[ Exit Fossile .


Sars .
I have brought you a present , madam , make good use of it .
So I leave you together .


[ Exit Sarsnet .


[ Townley opens the chest : Plotwell , who was cover'd with a gown and petticoat , gets out . ]


Town .
Never was any thing so lucky .
The doctor is just this minute gone to a patient .


Plot .
I tempt dangers enough in your service .
I am almost crippled in this chest-adventure .
Oh my knees !
Prithee , my dear , lead me to a bed where I may strech myself out .


[ Leading her off .


Enter SARSNET .


Sars .
Oh madam !
yonder is the doctor in deep discourse with Underplot : I fear he has dogg'd me , and betray'd us .
The are both coming back together .


[ Exit Sarsnet .


Plot .
I 'll shrink snug into my shell again .


Town .
That he may directly pop upon you .
The trunk will be the first place he will examine , have you no presence of mind ?
You sit for an intrigue !


Plot .
What shall I do ?


Town .
Fear not , you shall be invisible i th is very spot .


Plot .
What do you mean ?
he 's just at the door .
You intend to discover me .


Town .
Mistrust me not : You shall walk out before his face at that very door , though he bring in a hundred spies , and not one of them shall perceive you .


Plot .
Do n't trifle .
Are you mad ?
[ knocking at the door . ]
Nay , now 't is too late .


Town .
Arm thyself with flounces , and fortify thyself with whalebone  enter beneath the cupulo of this petticoat .


Plot .
The best security in the world !
an old fellow has seldom any thing to do beneath that circumferance .


Town .
No more but under it immediately .


[ Plotwell goes under it .


Thus Venus , when approaching foes assail , Shields her AEÆneas with a silken veil .


Enter FOSSILE .


Town .
O my dear you come opportunely .
How do you like my fancy in this new petticoat ?
there is something in it so odd !


Fos .
You have another in your chest much odder .
I want to see that .


Town .
How jaunty the flounces !


Fos .
Ay , 't is plain she would lure me from the chest  there I shall find him .


[ aside .


Town .
The lace !
the fringe !


Fos .
All this is nothing to the embroider'd sattin .
Prithee , my dear , give me the key .


Town .
Sure never was any thing so prettily disposed .
Observe but the air of it : So degagee !
But the lining is so charming .


[ She walks to the door , and Fossile to the trunk .
Plotwell kisses her out of the top of the petticoat , and then goes off . ]


[ As Fossile is cautiously opening the trunk with his sword drawn , Townley comes up to him . ]


What , more of your frolicks , Mr. Fossile .
What time of the moon is this ?


Fos .
This Underplot is a confounded villain , he would make me jealous of an honest civil gentleman , only for an opportunity to cuckold me himself .
[ aside . ]
Come , my dear , forget all that is past .
I know -- I have proved thee virtuous .
But prithee , love , leave me a moment  I expect some Egyptian rarities .


[ Exeunt severally .


ACT V .


Enter FOSSILE with a vial in his hand .


Fos .
This is all we have for the flying dragon so celebrated by antiquity .
A cheap purchase !
It cost me but fifteen guineas .
But the Jew made it up in the butterfly and the spider .


Enter two porters bearing a Mummy .


Oh !
here 's my mummy .
Set him down .
I am in haste .
Tell captain Bantam , I 'll talk with him at the coffee-house .


[ Exit porters .


Enter two porters bearing an Alligator .


A most stupendous animal !
set him down .


[ Exit porters .


Poor lady Hippokekoana 's convulsions !
I believe there is fatality in it , that I can never get to her .
Who can I trust my house to in my absence ?
Were my wife as chaste as Lucretia , who knows what an unlucky minute may bring forth !
In cuckoldom , the art of attack is prodigiously improved beyond the art of defence .
So far it is manifest , Underplot has a design upon my honour .
For the ease of my mind , I will lock up my wife in this my musæum , 'till my return .


Enter TOWNLEY , and SARSNET .


You will find something here , my dear , to divert yourself .


Town .
I hate the sight of these strange creatures  but since I am Mr. Fossiles wife , I shall endeavour to conquer my aversion .


Foss .
Thou may ` st safely be here to day , my dear  to-morrow thou shouldst no more enter this room than a pest-house .
'T is dangerous for women that are impregnated .
But poor lady Hippokekoana suffers all this while .


[ Exit Fossile with a key in his hand .


Town .
Since he has lock'd me in , to be even with him , I 'll bolt him out .


[ Plotwell dress'd like a Mummy , comes forward .


Plot .


Thus trav ` ling far from his Egyptian tomb , Thy Anthony salutes his Cleopatra .


Town .


Thus Cleopatra , in desiring arms , Receives her Anthony -- But prithee dear pickled Hieroglyphic , who so suddenly could assist thee with this shape .


Plot .
The play-house can dress mummies , bears , lions , crocodiles , and all the monsters of Lybia .
My arms madam are ready to break their past-board prison to embrace you .


Town .
Not so hasty .
Stay till the jealous fool is out of sight .


Plot .
Our ill stars , and the devil , have brought him back so often


Town .
He can never parry this blow , nor grow jealous of his mummy .
A mummy is his intimate friend .


Plot .
And a man can not easily be cuckolded by any body else .


Town .
Here may ` st thou remain the ornament of his study , and the support of his old age .
Thou shalt divert his company and be a father to his children .
I will bring thee legs of pullets , remnants of tarts , and fragments of desarts .
Thou shalt be fed like Bell and the Dragon .


Plot .
But madam  before you entertain me as your mummy in ordinary , you ought to be acquainted with my abilities to discharge that office .
Let me slip off this habit of death , you shall find I have some symptoms of life .
-- Thus Jove within the milk-white swan compress'd his Leda .


[ Underplot in the Alligator crawls forward , then rises up and embraces her . ]


Underp .


Thus Jove within the serpents scaly folds , Twin'd round the Macedonian queen ,


Town .
Ah !


[ shrieks .


Plot .
Fear not , madam .
This is my evil genius Underplot that still haunts me .
How the devil got you here ?


Underp .
Why should not the play-house lend me a crocodile as well as you a mummy ?


Town .
How unlucky is this !
[ Aside . ]
Nay , I do n't know but I may have twenty lovers in this collection .
You snakes , sharks , monkeys , and mantygers , speak , and put in your claim before it is too late .


Underp .
Mr. Mummy , your humble servant  the lady is pre-engag'd .


Plot .
Pray , Mr. Crocodile , let the lady make her own choice .


Underp .
Crocodile as I am , I must be treated with common humanity .
You ca n't , madam , disown the message you sent me .


Town .
Well !
ye pair of Egyptian lovers , agree this matter between you , and I will acquit myself like a person of honour to you both .


Plot .
Madam !
If I do n't love you above all your sex , may I be banish'd the studies of virtuoso 's  and smoak'd like dutch beef in a chimney --


Underp .
If I do n't love you more than that stale mummy , may I never more be proclaim'd at a show of monsters , by the sound of a glass-trumpet .


Plot .
May I be sent to ` Pothecary 's - hall , and beat up into venice treacle for the fleet and the army , if this heart --


Underp .
May I be stuff'd with straw , and given to a mountebank , if this soul --


Plot .
Madam I am a human creature .
Taste my balsamick kiss .


Underp .
A lover in swadling-clouts !
What is his kiss , to my embrace ?


Plot .
Look upon me , madam .
See how I am embroider'd with hieroglyphicks .


Underp .
Consider my beautiful row of teeth .


Plot .
My balmy breath .


Underp .
The strong joints of my back .


Plot .
My erect stature .


Underp .
My long tail .


Town .
Such a contest of beauty !
How shall I decide it ?


Plot .
Take me out of my shell , madam , and I 'll make you a present of the kernel .


Underp .
Then I must be upon a level with him , and be uncrocodil'd .


Town .
Keep both of you your shapes , and we are in no fear of a surprize from the doctor : If you uncase , his presence would undo us .
Sure never was any thing so unlucky -- I hear his foot-steps  quick to your posts .


[ Mummy and Crocodile run to their places .


Enter FOSSILE , Dr. Nautilus , and Dr. Possum .


Naut .
Much joy to the learned Dr. Fossile .
To have a mummy , an alligator , and a wife , all in one day , is too great happiness for mortal man !


Poss .
This an alligator !
Alack a day , brother Nautilus , this is a mere lizard , an eft , a shrimp to mine .


Naut .
How improving would it be to the female understanding , if the closets of the ladies were furnish'd , or , as I may say , ornamented and embellish'd with preserv'd butterflies , and beautiful shells , instead of China jars , and absurd Indian pictures .


Town .
Now for a stratagem to bring off my unsuccessful pair of gallants .


[ Aside .


[ Exit Townley .


Foss .
Ah , Dr. Nautilus , how have I languish'd for your feather of the bird Porphyrion !


Naut .
But your dart of the Mantichora !


Foss .
Your haft of the antediluvian trowel , unquestionably the tool of one of the Babel masons !


Naut .
What 's that to your fragment of Seth 's pillar ?


Poss .
Gentlemen , I affirm I have a greater curiosity than all of them .
I have an entire leaf of Noah 's journal aboard the ark , that was hewen out of a porphyry pillar in Palmyra .


[ Fossile opens the case of the mummy .


Naut .
By the formation of the muscular parts of the visage , I conjecture that this mummy is male .


Pos .
Male , brother !
I am sorry to observe your ignorance of the symetry of a human body .
Do but observe the projection of the hip  besides , the bloom upon the face  't is a female beyond all contradiction .


Fos .
Let us have no rash dispute , brothers  but proceed methodically -- Behold the vanity of mankind !
[ pointing to the mummy . ]
Some Ptolemy perhaps !
--


Naut .
Who by his pyramid and pickle thought to secure to himself death immortal .


Fos .
His pyramid , alas !
is now but a wainscot case .


Pos .
And his pickle can scarce raise him to the dignity of a collar of brawn .


Fos .
Pardon me , Dr. Possum : The musæum of the curious is a lasting monument .
And I think it no degradation to a dead person of quality , to bear the rank of an anatomy in the learned world .


Naut .
By your favour , Dr. Possum , a collar of brawn !
I affirm , he is better to be taken inwardly than a collar of brawn .


Fos .
An excellent medicine !
he is hot in the first-degree , and exceeding powerful in some diseases of women .


Naut .
Right , Dr. Fossile  for your Asphaltion .


Pos .
Pice-Asphaltus , by your leave .


Naut .
By your leave , doctor Possum , I say , Asphaltion .


Pos .
And I positively say , Pice-Asphaltus .


Naut .
If you had read Dioscorides or Pliny --


Poss .
I have read Dioscorides .
And I do affirm Pice-Asphaltus .


Foss .
Be calm , Gentlemen .
Both of you handle this argument with great learning , judgment , and perspicuity .
For the present , I beseech you to concord , and turn your speculations on my alligator .


Poss .
The skin is impenetrable even to a sword .


Naut .
Dr. Possum I will show you the contrary .


[ Draws his sword .


Poss .
In the mean time I will try the mummy with this knife , on the point of which you shall smell the pitch , and be convinc'd that it is the Pice-Asphaltus .


[ Takes up a rusty knife .


Foss .
Hold , Sir : You will not only deface my mummy , but spoil my Roman sacrificing-knife .


Enter TOWNLEY .


Town .
I must lure them from this experiment , or we are discover'd .


[ Aside .


[ She looks through a telescope .


What do I see !
most prodigious !
a star as broad as the moon in the day-time !


[ The doctors go to her .


Poss .
Only a halo about the sun , I suppose .


Naut .
Your suppositions , doctor , seem to be groundless .
Let me make my observation .


[ Nautilus and Possum struggle to look first .


Town .
Now for your escape :


[ To Plotwell and Underplot .


[ They run to the door , but find it lock'd .


Underp .
What an unlucky dog I am !


Town .
Quick .
Back to your posts .
Do n't move , and rely upon me .
I have still another artifice .


[ They run back to their places .


[ Exit Townley .


Naut .
I can espy no celestial body but the sun .


Poss .
Brother Nautilus , your eyes are somewhat dim  your sight is not fit for astronomical observations .


Foss .
Is the focus of the glass right ?
hold gentlemen , I see it  about the bigness of Jupiter .


Naut .
No phenomenon offers itself to my speculation .


Poss .
Point over yonder chimney .
Directly south .


Naut .
Thitherward , begging your pardon , Dr. Possum , I affirm to be the north .


Foss .
East .


Poss .
South .


Naut .
North .
Alas !
what an ignorant thing is vanity !
I was just making a reflection on the ignorance of my brother Possum , in the nature of the crocodile .


Poss .
First , brother Nautilus , convince yourself of the composition of the mummy .


Naut .
I will insure your alligator from any damage .
His skin I affirm once more to be impenetrable .


[ draws his sword .


Poss .
I will not deface any hieroglyphick .


[ Goes to the mummy with the knife .


Foss .
I never oppose a luciferous experiment .
It is the beaten highway to truth .


[ Plotwell and Underplot leap from their places  the doctors are frighted . ]


Foss .
Speak , I conjure thee .
Art thou the ghost of some murder'd Egyptian monarch ?


Naut .
A rational question to a mummy !
But this monster can be no less than the devil himself , for crocodiles do n't walk .


Enter TOWNLEY and CLINKET .


[ Townley whispers Clinket .


Foss .
Gentlemen , wonder at nothing within these walls  for ever since I was married , nothing has happen'd to me in the common course of human life .


Clink .
Madam , without a compliment , you have a fine imagination .
The masquerade of the mummy and crocodile is extremely just  I would not rob you of the merit of the invention , yet since you make me the compliment , I shall be proud to take the whole contrivance of this masquerade upon myself .
[ To Townley . ]
Sir , be acquainted with my masqueraders .


[ To Fossile .


Foss .
Thou female imp of Appollo , more mischievous than Circe , who fed gentlemen of the army in a hog 's - stye !
What mean you by these gambols ?
this mummy , this crocodile ?


Clink .
Only a little mummery , uncle ?


Fos .
What an outragious conceit is this !
had you contented yourself with the metamorphosis of Jupiter , our skill in the classicks might have prevented our terror .


Clink .
I glory in the fertility of my invention the more , that it is beyond the imagination of a pagan deity .
Besides , it is form'd upon the vraysemblance  for I know you had a mummy and a crocodile to be brought home .


Fos .
Dr. Nautilus is an infirm tender gentleman  I wish the sudden concussion of his animal spirits may not kindle him into a fever .
I myself , I must confess , have an extreme palpitation .


Clink .
Dear uncle , be pacified .
We are both of us the votaries of our great master Appollo .
To you he has assign'd the art of healing : Me he has taught to sing  why then should we jangle in our kindred faculties ?


Fos .
Appollo , for ought I know , may be a very fine person  but this I am very sure of , that the skill he has given all his physicians is not sufficient to cure the madness of his poets .


Pos .
Hark ye , brother Fossile ?
Your Crocodile has proved a human creature , I wish your wife may not prove a crocodile .


Naut .
Hark ye , brother Fossile !
Your mummy , as you were saying , seemeth to be hot in the first degree , and is powerful in some diseases of women .


[ Exit Nautilus and Possum .


Fos .
You diabolical performers of my niece 's masquerade , will it please you to follow those gentlemen ?


Clink .
Nay , Sir , you shall see them dance first .


Fos .
Dance !
the devil !
bring me hither a spit , a fire-fork , I 'll try whether the monsters are impenetrable or no .


Plotw .
I hope , Sir , you will not expose us to the fury of the mob , since we came here upon so courteous a design .


Foss .
Good courteous Mr. Mummy , without more ceremony , will it please you to retire to your subterraneous habitation .
And you Mr. Crocodile , about your business this moment , or you shall change your Nile for the next horse-pond .


Clink .
Spare my masqueraders .


Underp .
Let it never be said that the famous Dr. Fossile , so renowned for his charity to monsters , should violate the laws of hospitality , and turn a poor alligator naked into the street .


Foss .
Deposite your exuviæ then , and assume your human shape .


Underp .
For that I must beg your excuse .
A gentleman would not chuse to be known in these frolicks .


Foss .
Then out of my doors , here footman , out with him  out , thou hypocrite , of an alligator .


[ Underplot is turn'd out .


Sir , the respect I have for catacombs and pyramids , will not protect you .


[ A noise of mob within .


Enter PRUE .


Prue .
Sir , Sir , lock your doors , or else all your monsters will run home again to the Indies .
Your crocodile yonder has made his escape  if he get but to Somerset water-gate , he is gone for ever .


[ Exit Prue .


Enter a Footman .


Foot .
The herbwoman swore she knew him to be the devil , for she had met him one dark night in St. Pulchre 's church-yard  then the monster call'd a coach , methought with the voice of a christian  but a sailor that came by said he might be a crocodile for all that , for crocodiles could cry like children , and was for killing him outright , for they were good to eat in Egypt , but the constable cry'd take him alive , for what if he be an Egyptian , he is still the king 's subject .


Ex .
footman .


[ A noise of mob within .


Enter PRUE


Prue .
Then he was hurry'd a way by the mob .
A bull-dog ran away with fix joints of his tail , and the claw of his near foot before : At last by good fortune , to save his life , he fell in with the Hockley in the Hole bull and bear  the master claim'd him for his monster , and so he is now attended by a vast mob , very solemnly marching to Hockley in the Hole , with the bear in his front , the bull in his rear , and a monkey upon each shoulder .


Town .
Mr. Mummy , you had best draw the curtains of your chair , or the mob 's respect for the dead will scarce protect you .


[ Exit Plotwell in a chair .


Clink .
My concern for him obliges me to go see that he gets off safe , lest any further mischief befalls the persons of our masque .


[ Exit Clinket .


Fos .
Sweetly , Horace .
Nunquam satis , and so forth .
A man can never be too cautious .
Madam , sit down by me .
Pray how long is it since you and I have been married ?


Town .
Near three hours , Sir .


Fos .
And what anxieties has this time produc'd ?
the dangers of divorce !
calumniatory letters !
lewd fellows introduc'd by my niece !
groundless jealousies on both sides !
even thy virginity put to the touch-stone !
but this last danger I plung'd thee in myself  to leave thee in the room with two such robust young fellows .


Town .
Ay , with two young fellows !
but my dear , I know you did it ignorantly .


Fos .
This is the first blest minute of repose that I have enjoy'd in matrimony .
Dost thou know the reason , my dear , why I have chosen thee of all womankind ?


Town .
My face , perhaps .


Fos .
No .


Town .
My wit ?


Fos .
No .


Town .
My virtue and good humour .


Fos .
No .
But for the natural conformity of our constitutions .
Because thou art hot and moist in the third degree , and I myself cold and dry in the first .


Town .
And so nature has coupled us like the elements .


Fos .
Thou hast nothing to do but to submit thy constitution to my regimen .


Town .
You shall find me obedient in all things .


Foss .
It is strange , yet certain , that the intellects of the infant depend upon the suppers of the parents .
Diet must be prescrib'd .


Town .
So the wit of one 's posterity is determin'd by the choice of one 's cook .


Foss .
Right .
You may observe how French cooks , with their high ragousts , have contaminated our plain English understandings .
Our supper to night is extracted from the best authors .
How delightful is this minute of tranquility !
my soul is at ease .
How happy shalt thou make me !
thou shalt bring me the finest boy !


[ A knocking at the door ,


No mortal shall enter these doors this day .
[ knocking again . ]
Oh , it must be the news of poor lady Hippokekoana 's death .
Poor woman !
such is the condition of life , some die , and some are born , and I shall now make some reparation for the mortality of my patients by the fecundity of my wife .
My dear thou shalt bring me the finest boy !


Enter footman .


Foot .
Sir , here 's a seaman from Deptford must needs speak with you .


Foss .
Let him come in .
One of my retale Indian merchants , I suppose , that always brings me some odd thing .


Enter sailor with a child .


What hast thou brought me , friend , a young drill ?


Sail .
Look ye d' ye see , master , you know best whether a monkey begot him .


Foss .
A meer human child .


Town .
Thy carelessness , Sarsnet , has exposed me , I am lost and ruin'd .
O heav ` n !
heav ` n !
No , impudence assist me .


[ Aside .


Foss .
Is the child monstrous ?
or dost thou bring him here to take physick ?


Sail .
I care not what he takes so you take him .


Foss .
What does the fellow mean ?


Sail .
Fellow me no fellows .
My name is Jack Capstone of Deptford , and are not you the man that has the raree-show of oyster-shells and pebble-stones ?


Fos .
What if I am ?


Sail .
Why , then my invoice is right , I must leave my cargo here .


Town .
Miserable woman that I am !
how shall I support this fight !
thy bastard brought into thy family as soon as thy bride !


Fos .
Patience , patience , I beseech you .
Indeed I have no posterity .


Town .
You lascivious brute you .


Fos .
Passion is but the tempestuous cloud that obscures reason  be calm and I 'll convince you .
Friend , how come you to bring the infant hither ?


Sail .
My wife , poor woman , could give him suck no longer , for she died yesterday morning .
There 's a long account , master .
It was hard to trace him to the fountain-head .
I steer'd my course from lane to lane , I spoke to twenty old women , and at last was directed to a ribbon-shop in Covent-Garden , and they sent me hither , and so take the bantling and pay me his clearings .


[ Offers him the child .


Fos .
I shall find law for you , sirrah .
Call my neighbour Possum , he is a justice of peace , as well as a physician .


Town .
Call the man back .
If you have committed one folly , do n't expose yourself by a second .


Sail .
The gentlewoman says well .
Come , master , we all know that there is no boarding a pretty wench , without charges one way or other  you are a doctor , master , and have no surgeons bills to pay  and so can the better afford it .


Town .
Rather than you should bring a scandal on your character , I will submit to be a kind mother-in-law .


Enter Justice Possum , and Clerk .


Fos .
Mr. justice Possum , for now I must so call you , not brother Possum  here is a troublesome fellow with a child , which he would leave in my house .


Pos .
Another man 's child ?
he can not in law .


Fos .
It seemeth to me to be a child unlawfully begotten .


Pos .
A bastard !
who does he lay it to ?


Fos .
To our family .


Pos .
Your family , quatenus a family , being a body collective , can not get a bastard .
Is this child a bastard , honest friend ?


Sail .
I was neither by when his mother was show'd , nor when she was unladen  whether he belong to a fair trader , or be run goods , I can not tell : In short here I was sent , and here I will leave him .


Pos .
Dost then know his mother , friend ?


Sail .
I am no midwife , master  I did not see him born .


Pos .
You had best put up this matter , doctor .
A man of your years , when he has been wanton , can not be too cautious .


Fos .
This is all from the purpose .
I was married this morning at seven  let any man in the least acquainted with the powers of nature , judge whether that human creature could be conceiv'd and brought to maturity in one forenoon .


Pos .
This is but talk , doctor Fossile .
It is well for you , though I say it , that you have fallen into the hands of a person , who has study'd the civil and canon law in the point of bastardy .
The child is either yours or not yours .


Foss .
My child , Mr. Justice !


Pos .
Look ye , doctor Fossile , you confound filiation with legitimation .
Lawyers are of opinion , that filiation is necessary to legitimation , but not è contra .


[ The child cries


Foss .
I would not starve any of my own species , get the infant some water-pap .
But Mr. Justice --


Pos .
The proofs , I say , doctor , of filiation are five .
Nomination enunciatively pronounc'd , strong presumptions , and circumstantial proofs --


Foss .
What is all this to me ?
I tell you I know nothing of the child .


Pos .
Signs of paternal piety , similitude of features , and commerce with the mother .
And first of the first , nomination .
Has the doctor ever been heard to call the infant , son ?


Town .
He has call'd him child , since he came into this room .
You have indeed , Mr. Fossile .


Pos .
Bring hither the doctor 's great bible .
-- Let us examine in the blank leaf whether he be enroll'd among the rest of his children .


Foss .
I tell you , I never had any children .
I shall grow distracted , I shall --


Pos .
But did you give any orders against registring the child by the name of Fossile ?


Foss .
How was it possible ?


Pos .
Set down that , clerk .
He did not prohibit the registring the child in his own name .
We our selves have observed one sign of fatherly tenderness  clerk , set down the water-pap he order'd just now .
Come we may --


Foss .
What a jargon is this !


Pos .
Come we now , I say , to that which the lawyers call magnum naturæ argumentum , similitude of features .
Bring hither the child , friend  Dr. Fossile , look upon me .
The unequal circle of the infant 's face , somewhat resembles the inequality of the circumference of your countenance  he has also the vituline or calf-like concavity of the profile of your visage .


Foss .
Pish .


Pos .
And he is somewhat beetle-brow'd , and his nose will rise with time to an equal prominence with the doctor 's .


Town .
Indeed he has somewhat of your nose Mr. Fossile .


Foss .
Ridiculous !


Town .
The child is comely .


Pos .
Consider the large aperture of his mouth .


Sail .
Nay , the tokens are plain enough .
I have the fellow of him at home  but my wife told me two days ago , that this with the wall-eye and splay-foot belong'd to you , Sir .


[ Prue runs a-cross the stage with a letter , which Fossile snatches from her .


Fos .
Whither are you going so fast , hussy ?
I will examine every thing within these walls .
[ Exit Prue . ]
[ reads . ]
` For Richard Plotwell , esq  ' This letter unravels the whole affair : As she is an unfortunate relation of mine , I must beg you would act with discretion .


[ Gives Possum the letter .


Pos .
[ reads ]


` Sir , the child which you father'd is return'd back upon my hands .
Your Drury-lane friends have treated me with such rudeness , that they told me in plain terms I should be damn'd .
How unfortunate soever my offspring is , I hope you at least will defend the reputation of the unhappy


` Phoebe Clinket . '


-- As you say , doctor , the case is too plain  every circumstance hits .


Enter CLINKET .


Clink .
'T is very uncivil , Sir , to break open one 's letters .


Foss .
Would I had not  and that the contents of it had been a secret to me and all mankind for ever .
Wretched creature , to what a miserable condition has thy poetry reduc'd thee !


Clink .
I am not in the least mortified with the accident .
I know it has happen'd to many of the most famous daughters of Apollo  and to myself several times .


Foss .
I am thunderstruck at her impudence !
several times !


Clink .
I have had one returned upon my hands every winter for these five years past .
I may perhaps be excell'd by others in judgment and correctness of manners , but for fertility and readiness of conception , I will yield to nobody .


Foss .
Bless me , whence had she this luxuriant constitution !


Pos .
Patience , Sir .
Perhaps the lady may be married .


Town .
Tis infamous , Mr. Fossile , to keep her in your house  yet though you turn her out of doors , use her with some humanity  I will take care of the child .


Clink .
I can find no Denoüement of all this conversation .
Where is the crime , I pray , of writing a tragedy ?
I sent it to Drury-Lane house to be acted  and here it is return'd by the wrong goùt of the actors .


Pos .
This incident has somewhat embarrassed us .
But what mean you here , madam , by this expression ?
Your offspring .


Clink .
My tragedy , the offspring of my brain .
One of his majesty 's justices of the peace , and not understand the use of the metaphor !


Pos .
Doctor , you have used much artifice , and many demurrers  but the child must lie at your door at last .
Friend , speak plain what thou knowest of this matter .


Foss .
Let me relate my story .
This morning , I married this lady , and brought her from her lodgings , at Mrs. Chambers 's , in King-street , Covent-Garden .


Sail .
Mrs. Chambers !
To that place I was directed , where liv'd the maid that put the bantling out to be nurs'd by my wife for her lady  and who she was , 't is none of our business to enquire .


Pos .
Dost thou know the name of this maid ?


Sail .
Let me consider -- Lutestring .


Foss .
Sarsnet , thou mean ` st.


Sail .
Sarsnet , that 's right .


Town .
I 'll turn her out of my house this moment , Filthy creature !


Pos .
The evidence is plain .
You have cohabitation with the mother , doctor , currat lex .
And you must keep the child .


Foss .
Your decree is unjust , Sir , and I 'll seek my remedy at law .
As I never was espoused , I never had carnal knowledge of any woman  and my wife , Mrs. Susanna Townley , is a pure virgin at this hour for me .


Pos .
Susanna Townley !
Susannah Townley !
Look how runs the warrant you drew up this morning .


[ Clerk gives him a paper .


Madam , a word in private with you .
[ whispers her ] Doctor , my Lord Chief Justice has some business with this lady .


Foss .
My Lord Chief Justice business with my wife !


Pos .
To be plain with you , doctor Fossile , you have for these three hours entertain'd another man 's wife .
Her husband , lieutenant Bengal , is just returned from the Indies , and this morning took out a warrant from me for an elopement  it will be more for your credit to part with her privately , than to suffer her publickly to be carried off by a tipstaff .


Foss .
Surprizing have been the events of this day  but this , the strangest of all , settles my future repose .
Let her go -- I have not dishonoured the bed of lieutenant Bengal -- Hark ye friend !
Do you follow her with that badge of her infamy .


Pos .
By your favour , doctor , I never reverse my judgment .
The child is yours : for it can not belong to a man who has been three years absent in the East-Indies .
Leave the child .


Sail .
I find you are out of humour , master .
So I 'll call to-morrow for his clearings .


[ Sailor lays down the child , and exit with Possum , Clerk , and Townley . ]


Clink .
Uncle , by this day 's adventure , every one has got something .
Lieutenant Bengal has got his wife again  you a fine child  and I a plot for a comedy  and I 'll this moment set about it .


[ Exit Clinket .


Foss .
What must be , must be .
[ takes up the child . ]
Fossile , thou didst want posterity : Here behold thou hast it .
A wife thou didst not want  thou hast none .
But thou art caressing a child that is not thy own .
What then ?
a thousand , and a thousand husbands are doing the same thing this very instant  and the knowledge of truth is desirable , and makes thy case the better , What signifies whether a man beget his child or not ?
How rediculous is the act itself , said the great emperor Antoninus !
I now look upon myself as a Roman citizen  it is better that the father should adopt the child , than that the wife should adopt the father .


[ Exit Fossile .


EPILOGUE .


Spoke by Mrs. OLDFIELD .


The ancient Epilogue , as criticks write , Was , Clap your hands , excuse us , and good-night .
The modern always was a kind essay To reconcile the audience to the play : More polish'd , we of late have learn'd to fly At parties , treaties , nations , ministry .
Our author more genteelly leaves these brawls To coffee-houses , and to coblers stalls .
His very monsters are of sweet condition , None but the Crocodile 's a politician  He reaps the blessings of his double nature , And , Trimmer like , can live on land or water : Yet this same monster should be kindly treated , He lik'd a lady 's flesh -- but not to eat it .


As for my other spark , my favourite Mummy , His feats were such , smart youths !
as might become ye  Dead as he seem'd , he had sure signs of life  His hieroglyphicks pleas'd the doctor 's wife .


Whom can our well-bred poetess displease ?
She writ like quality -- with wond ` rous ease : All her offence was harmless want of wit  Is that a crime ?
-- ye powers , preserve the pit .


My doctor too , to give the devil his due , When every creature did his spouse pursue , ( Men sound in living , bury'd flesh , dry'd fish , ) Was e ` en as civil as a wife could wish .
Yet he was somewhat saucy with his viol  What !
put young maids to that unnat ` ral trial !
So hard a test !
why , if you needs will make it , Faith , let us marry first , -- and then we 'll take it .


Who could be angry , though like Fossile teaz'd ?
Consider , in three hours , the man was eas'd .
How many of you are for life beguil'd , And keep as well the mother , as the child !
None but a Tar could be so tender-hearted , To claim a wife that had been three years parted  Would you do this , my friends ?
-- believe me , never !
When modishly you part -- you part for ever .


Join then your voices , be the play excus'd For once , though no one living is abus'd  To that bright circle that commands our duties , To you superior eighteen-penny beauties , To the lac'd hat and cockard of the pit , { To all , in one word , we our cause submit , { Who think good breeding is a-kin to wit . {
