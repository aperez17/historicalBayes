169 .
-- To John Murray .
[ 1 ]


Newstead Abbey , Notts. , August 23 , 1811 .


Sir , -- A domestic calamity in the death of a near relation [ 2 ] has hitherto prevented my addressing you on the subject of this letter .
My friend , Mr. Dallas , [ 3 ] has placed in your hands a manuscript poem written by me in Greece , which he tells me you do not object to publishing .
But he also informed me in London that you wished to send the MS. to Mr. Gifford .
[ 4 ] Now , though no one would feel more gratified by the chance of obtaining his observations on a work than myself , there is in such a proceeding a kind of petition for praise , that neither my pride -- or whatever you please to call it -- will admit .


Mr. G. is not only the first satirist of the day , but editor of one of the principal reviews .
As such , he is the last man whose censure ( however eager to avoid it ) I would deprecate by clandestine means .
You will therefore retain the manuscript in your own care , or , if it must needs be shown , send it to another .
Though not very patient of censure , I would fain obtain fairly any little praise my rhymes might deserve , at all events not by extortion , and the humble solicitations of a bandied-about MS. I am sure a little consideration will convince you it would be wrong .


If you determine on publication , I have some smaller poems ( never published ) , a few notes , and a short dissertation on the literature of the modern Greeks ( written at Athens ) , which will come in at the end of the volume .
-- And , if the present poem should succeed , it is my intention , at some subsequent period , to publish some selections from my first work , -- my Satire , -- another nearly the same length , and a few other things , with the MS. now in your hands , in two volumes .
-- But of these hereafter .
You will apprize me of your determination .


I am , Sir , your very obedient , humble servant ,


BYRON .

-- To James Wedderburn Webster .
[ 1 ]


Newstead Abbey , August 24th , 1811 .


MY DEAR W. , -- Conceiving your wrath to be somewhat evaporated , and your Dignity recovered from the Hysterics into which my innocent note from London had thrown it , I should feel happy to be informed how you have determined on the disposal of this accursed Coach , [ 2 ] which has driven us out of our Good humour and Good manners to a complete Standstill , from which I begin to apprehend that I am to lose altogether your valuable correspondence .
Your angry letter arrived at a moment , to which I shall not allude further , as my happiness is best consulted in forgetting it .
[ 3 ]


You have perhaps heard also of the death of poor Matthews , whom you recollect to have met at Newstead .
He was one whom his friends will find it difficult to replace , nor will Cambridge ever see his equal .


I trust you are on the point of adding to your relatives instead of losing them , and of friends a man of fortune will always have a plentiful stock -- at his Table .


I dare say now you are gay , and connubial , and popular , so that in the next parliament we shall be having you a County Member .
But beware your Tutor , for I am sure he Germanized that sanguinary letter  you must not write such another to your Constituents  for myself ( as the mildest of men ) I shall say no more about it .


Seriously , mio Caro W. , if you can spare a moment from Matrimony , I shall be glad to hear that you have recovered from the pucker into which this Vis ( one would think it had been a Sulky ) has thrown you  you know I wish you well , and if I have not inflicted my society upon you according to your own Invitation , it is only because I am not a social animal , and should feel sadly at a loss amongst Countesses and Maids of Honour , particularly being just come from a far Country , where Ladies are neither carved for , or fought for , or danced after , or mixed at all ( publicly ) with the Men-folks , so that you must make allowances for my natural diffidence and two years travel .


But ( God and yourself willing ) I shall certes pay my promised visit , as I shall be in town , if Parliament meets , in October .


In the mean time let me hear from you ( without a privy Council ) , and believe me in sober sadness ,


Yours very sincerely ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : James Wedderburn Webster ( 1789-1840 ) , grandson of Sir A. Wedderburn , Bart. , whose third son , David , assumed the additional name of Webster , was the author of ` Waterloo , and other Poems ' ( 1816 ) , and ' A Genealogical Account of the Wedderburn Family ' ( privately printed , 1819 ) .
He was with Byron , possibly at Cambridge , certainly at Athens in 1810 .
He married , in 1810 , Lady Frances Caroline Annesley , daughter of Arthur , first Earl of Mountnorris and eighth Viscount Valencia .
He was knighted in 1822 .
Byron , in 1813 , lent him L1000 .
Lady Frances died in 1837 , and her husband in 1840 .


Moore ( ` Memoirs , Journals , etc. ' , vol .
iii .
p. 112 ) mentions dining with Webster at Paris in 1820 .


`` He told me , '' writes Moore , `` that , one day , travelling from Newstead to town with Lord Byron in his vis-a-vis , the latter kept his pistols beside him , and continued silent for hours , with the most ferocious expression possible on his countenance .


` For God 's sake , my dear B. , ' said W -- at last , ` what are you thinking of ?
Are you about to commit murder ?
or what other dreadful thing are you meditating ? '


To which Byron answered that he always had a sort of presentiment that his own life would be attacked some time or other  and that this was the reason of his always going armed , as it was also the subject of his thoughts at that moment . ''


Moore also adds ( ` ibid ' .
, p. 292 ) ,


`` W. W. owes Lord Byron , he says , L1000 , and does not seem to have the slightest intention of paying him . ''


Lady Frances was the lady to whom Byron seriously devoted himself in 1813-4 .
Subsequently she was practically separated from her husband , and Byron , in 1823 , endeavoured to reconcile them .
Moore ( ` Memoirs , Journals , etc ' .
, vol .
ii .
p. 249 ) writes ,


`` To the Devizes ball in the evening  Lady Frances W. there  introduced to her , and had much conversation , chiefly about our friend Lord B. Several of those beautiful things , published ( if I remember right ) with the ` Bride ' , were addressed to her .
She must have been very pretty when she had more of the freshness of youth , though she is still but five or six and twenty  but she looks faded already '' ( 1819 ) .


In the Court of Common Pleas , February 16 , 1816 , the libel action of ` Webster v. Baldwin ' was heard .
The plaintiff obtained L2000 in damages for a libel charging Lady Frances and the Duke of Wellington with adultery . ]


[ Footnote 2 : On his return to London in July , 1811 , Byron ordered a ` vis-a-vis ' to be built by Goodall .
This he exchanged for a carriage belonging to Webster , who , within a few weeks , resold the ` vis-a-vis ' to Byron .
The two following letters from Byron to Webster explain the transaction : --


`` Reddish 's Hotel , 29th July , 1811 .


`` MY DEAR WEBSTER , -- As this eternal ` vis-a-vis ' seems to sit heavy on your soul , I beg leave to apprize you that I have arranged with Goodall : you are to give me the promised Wheels , and the lining , with ` the Box at Brighton , ' and I am to pay the stipulated sum .


I am obliged to you for your favourable opinion , and trust that the happiness you talk so much of will be stationary , and not take those freaks to which the felicity of common mortals is subject .
I do very sincerely wish you well , and am so convinced of the justice of your matrimonial arguments , that I shall follow your example as soon as I can get a sufficient price for my coronet .
In the mean time I should be happy to drill for my new situation under your auspices  but business , inexorable business , keeps me here .
Your letters are forwarded .
If I can serve you in any way , command me .
I will endeavour to fulfil your requests as awkwardly as another .
I shall pay you a visit , perhaps , in the autumn .
Believe me , dear W. ,


Yours unintelligibly ,


B. ''


`` Reddish 's Hotel , July 31st , 1811 .


MY DEAR W. W. , -- I always understood that the ` lining ' was to accompany the ` carriage '  if not , the ` carriage ' may accompany the ` lining ' , for I will have neither the one nor the other .
In short , to prevent squabbling , this is my determination , so decide  -- if you leave it to my ` feelings ' ( as you say ) they are very strongly in favour of the said lining .
Two hundred guineas for a carriage with ancient lining !!!
Rags and rubbish !
You must write another pamphlet , my dear W. , before  but pray do not waste your time and eloquence in expostulation , because it will do neither of us any good , but decide -- content or ` not ' content .
The best thing you can do for the Tutor you speak of will be to send him in your Vis ( with the lining ) to ` the U -- Niversity of Goettingen . '
How can you suppose ( now that my own Bear is dead ) that I have any situation for a German genius of this kind , till I get another , or some children ?
I am infinitely obliged by your invitations , but I ca n't pay so high for a second-hand chaise to make my friends a visit .
The coronet will not ` grace ' the ` pretty Vis , ' till your tattered lining ceases to ` dis ` grace it .
Pray favour me with an answer , as we must finish the affair one way or another immediately , -- before next week .


Believe me , yours truly ,


BYRON . ''


`` Byron , '' says Webster , in a note , `` was more than strict about trifles . '' ]

171 .
-- To R. C. Dallas .


Newstead Abbey , August 25 , 1811 .


Being fortunately enabled to frank , I do not spare scribbling , having sent you packets within the last ten days .
I am passing solitary , and do not expect my agent to accompany me to Rochdale [ 1 ] before the second week in September  a delay which perplexes me , as I wish the business over , and should at present welcome employment .
I sent you exordiums , annotations , etc. , for the forthcoming quarto , if quarto it is to be : and I also have written to Mr. Murray my objection to sending the MS. to Juvenal , [ 2 ] but allowing him to show it to any others of the calling .
Hobhouse [ 3 ] is amongst the types already : so , between his prose and my verse , the world will be decently drawn upon for its paper-money and patience .
Besides all this , my ` Imitation of Horace ' [ 4 ] is gasping for the press at Cawthorn 's , but I am hesitating as to the how and the when , the single or the double , the present or the future .
You must excuse all this , for I have nothing to say in this lone mansion but of myself , and yet I would willingly talk or think of aught else .


What are you about to do ?
Do you think of perching in Cumberland , as you opined when I was in the metropolis ?
If you mean to retire , why not occupy Miss Milbanke 's `` Cottage of Friendship , '' late the seat of Cobbler Joe , [ 5 ] for whose death you and others are answerable ?
His `` Orphan Daughter '' ( pathetic Pratt ! )
will , certes , turn out a shoemaking Sappho .
Have you no remorse ?
I think that elegant address to Miss Dallas should be inscribed on the cenotaph which Miss Milbanke means to stitch to his memory .


The newspapers seem much disappointed at his Majesty 's not dying , or doing something better .
[ 6 ] I presume it is almost over .
If parliament meets in October , I shall be in town to attend .
I am also invited to Cambridge for the beginning of that month , but am first to jaunt to Rochdale .
Now Matthews [ 7 ] is gone , and Hobhouse in Ireland , I have hardly one left there to bid me welcome , except my inviter .
At three-and-twenty I am left alone , and what more can we be at seventy ?
It is true I am young enough to begin again , but with whom can I retrace the laughing part of life ?
It is odd how few of my friends have died a quiet death , -- I mean , in their beds .
But a quiet life is of more consequence .
Yet one loves squabbling and jostling better than yawning .
This ` last word ' admonishes me to relieve you from


Yours very truly , etc. .

( ` Auckland Correspondence ' , vol .
iv .
p. 366 ) .
It was , however , the mind , and not the physical strength that failed .

-- To R. C. Dallas .
[ 1 ]


Newstead Abbey , Aug. 27 , 1811 .


I was so sincere in my note on the late Charles Matthews , and do feel myself so totally unable to do justice to his talents , that the passage must stand for the very reason you bring against it .
To him all the men I ever knew were pigmies .
He was an intellectual giant .
It is true I loved Wingfield [ 2 ] better  he was the earliest and the dearest , and one of the few one could never repent of having loved : but in ability -- ah !
you did not know Matthews !


` Childe Harold ' may wait and welcome -- books are never the worse for delay in the publication .
So you have got our heir , George Anson Byron , [ 3 ] and his sister , with you .


You may say what you please , but you are one of the ` murderers ' of Blackett , and yet you wo n't allow Harry White 's genius .
[ 4 ]


Setting aside his bigotry , he surely ranks next Chatterton .
It is astonishing how little he was known  and at Cambridge no one thought or heard of such a man till his death rendered all notice useless .
For my own part , I should have been most proud of such an acquaintance : his very prejudices were respectable .
There is a sucking epic poet at Granta , a Mr. Townsend , [ 5 ] ` protege ' of the late Cumberland .
Did you ever hear of him and his ` Armageddon ' ?
I think his plan ( the man I do n't know ) borders on the sublime : though , perhaps , the anticipation of the `` Last Day '' ( according to you Nazarenes ) is a little too daring : at least , it looks like telling the Lord what he is to do , and might remind an ill-natured person of the line ,


`` And fools rush in where angels fear to tread . ''


But I do n't mean to cavil , only other folks will , and he may bring all the lambs of Jacob Behmen about his ears .
However , I hope he will bring it to a conclusion , though Milton is in his way .


Write to me -- I dote on gossip -- and make a bow to Ju -- , and shake George by the hand for me  but , take care , for he has a sad sea paw .


P.S. -- I would ask George here , but I do n't know how to amuse him -- all my horses were sold when I left England , and I have not had time to replace them .
Nevertheless , if he will come down and shoot in September , he will be very welcome : but he must bring a gun , for I gave away all mine to Ali Pacha , and other Turks .
Dogs , a keeper , and plenty of game , with a very large manor , I have -- a lake , a boat , houseroom , and neat wines .


[ Footnote 1 : Dallas , writing to Byron , August 18 , 1811 , had said ,


`` I have been reading the ` Remains ' of Kirke White , and find that you have to answer for misleading me .
He does not , in my opinion , merit the high praise you have bestowed upon him . ''


Writing again , August 26 , he objected to the ` note ' on Matthews in ` Childe Harold ' :


`` In your note , as it stands , it strikes me that the eulogy on Matthews is a ` little ' at the expense of Wingfield and others whom you ` have ' commemorated .
I should think it quite enough to say that his Powers and Attainments were above all praise , without expressly admitting them to be above that of a Muse who soars high in the praise of others . '' ]

The remaining four books were never published .
Townsend became a Canon of Durham in 1825 , and held the stall till his death in 1857 .
Richard Cumberland , dramatist , novelist , and essayist ( 1732-1811 ) , the `` Sir Fretful Plagiary '' of ` The Critic ' , announced the forthcoming poem in the ` London Review '  but , as Townsend says , in the Preface to ` Armageddon ' , praised him `` too abundantly and prematurely . ''
`` My talents , '' he adds , `` were neither equal to my own ambition , nor his zeal to serve me . ''

Newstead Abbey , August 30th , 1811 .


My Dear Augusta , -- The embarrassments you mention in your last letter I never heard of before , but that disease is epidemic in our family .
Neither have I been apprised of any of the changes at which you hint , indeed how should I ?
On the borders of the Black Sea , we heard only of the Russians .
So you have much to tell , and all will be novelty .


I do n't know what Scrope Davies [ 2 ] meant by telling you I liked Children , I abominate the sight of them so much that I have always had the greatest respect for the character of Herod .
But , as my house here is large enough for us all , we should go on very well , and I need not tell you that I long to see you .
I really do not perceive any thing so formidable in a Journey hither of two days , but all this comes of Matrimony , you have a Nurse and all the etceteras of a family .
Well , I must marry to repair the ravages of myself and prodigal ancestry , but if I am ever so unfortunate as to be presented with an Heir , instead of a Rattle he shall be provided with a Gag .


I shall perhaps be able to accept D 's invitation to Cambridge , but I fear my stay in Lancashire will be prolonged , I proceed there in the 2d week in Septr to arrange my coal concerns ,  then if I ca n't persuade some wealthy dowdy to ennoble the dirty puddle of her mercantile Blood , -- why -- I shall leave England and all it 's clouds for the East again  I am very sick of it already .
Joe [ 3 ] has been getting well of a disease that would have killed a troop of horse  he promises to bear away the palm of longevity from old Parr .
As you wo n't come , you will write  I long to hear all those unutterable things , being utterly unable to guess at any of them , unless they concern your relative the Thane of Carlisle , [ 4 ] though I had great hopes we had done with him .


I have little to add that you do not already know , and being quite alone , have no great variety of incident to gossip with  I am but rarely pestered with visiters , and the few I have I get rid of as soon as possible .
I will now take leave of you in the Jargon of 1794 .
`` Health  Fraternity ! ''


Yours always , B .

[ Footnote 1 of Letter 7 ] Byron 's letter is in answer to the following from his half-sister :


`` 6 Mile Bottom , Aug. 27th .


`` My Dearest Brother , -- Your letter was stupidly sent to Town to me on Sunday , from whence I arrived at home yesterday  consequently I have not received it so soon as I ought to have done .
I feel so very happy to have the pleasure of hearing from you that I will not delay a moment answering it , altho ' I am in all the delights of ` unpacking ' , and afraid of being too late for the Post .


`` I have been a fortnight in Town , and went up on my ` eldest ' little girl 's account .
She had been very unwell for some time , and I could not feel happy till I had better advice than this neighbourhood affords .
She is , thank Heaven !
much better , and I hope in a fair way to be quite ` herself ' again .
Mr. Davies flattered me by saying she was exactly the sort of child ` you ' would delight in .
I am determined not to say another word in her praise for fear you should accuse me of partiality and expect too much .
The youngest ( ` little ' Augusta ) is just 6 months old , and has no particular merit at present but a very sweet placid temper .


`` Oh !
that I could immediately set out to Newstead and shew them to you .
I ca n't tell you ` half ' the happiness it would give me to see it and ` you '  but , my dearest B. , it is a long journey and serious undertaking all things considered .
Mr. Davies writes me word you promise to make him a visit bye and bye  ` pray do ' , you can then so easily come here .
I have set my heart upon it .
Consider how very long it is since I 've seen you .


`` I have indeed ` much ' to tell you  but it is more easily ` said ' than ` written ' .
Probably you have heard of many changes in our situation since you left England  in a ` pecuniary ' point of view it is materially altered for the worse  perhaps in other respects better .
Col. Leigh has been in Dorsetshire and Sussex during my stay in Town .
I expect him at home towards the end of this week , and hope to make him acquainted with you ere long .


`` I have not time to write half I have to say , for my letter must go  but I prefer writing in a hurry to not writing at all .
You ca n't think how much I feel for your griefs and losses , or how much and constantly I have thought of you lately .
I began a letter to you in Town , but destroyed it , from the fear of appearing troublesome .
There are times , I know , when one can not write with any degree of comfort or satisfaction .
I intend to do so again shortly , so I hope yon wo n't think me a bore .


`` Remember me most kindly to Old Joe .
I rejoice to hear of his health and prosperity .
Your letter ( some parts of it at least ) made me laugh .
I am so very glad to hear you have sufficiently overcome your prejudices against the ` fair sex ' to have determined upon marrying  but I shall be most anxious that my future ` Belle Soeur ' should have more attractions than merely money , though to be sure ` that ' is somewhat necessary .
I have not another moment , dearest B. , so forgive me if I write again very soon , and believe me ,


`` Your most affec ` tn Sister , A. L .


`` Do write if you can . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : For Scrope Berdmore Davies , see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 165 , ` note ' 2 .
[ Footnote 2 of Letter 86 ] The following story is told of him by Byron , in a passage of his ` Detached Thoughts ' ( Ravenna , 1821 ) :


`` One night Scrope Davies at a Gaming house ( before I was of age ) , being tipsy as he usually was at the Midnight hour , and having lost monies , was in vain intreated by his friends , one degree less intoxicated than himself , to come or go home .
In despair , he was left to himself and to the demons of the dice-box .


`` Next day , being visited about two of the Clock , by some friends just risen with a severe headache and empty pockets ( who had left him losing at four or five in the morning ) , he was found in a sound sleep , without a night-cap , and not particularly encumbered with bed-cloathes : a Chamber-pot stood by his bed-side , brim-full of -- ` Bank Notes ! '
, all won , God knows how , and crammed , Scrope knew not where  but THERE they were , all good legitimate notes , and to the amount of some thousand pounds . '' ]

Newstead Abbey , Aug ` st 30th , 1811 .


MY DEAR AUGUSTA , -- I wrote to you yesterday , and as you will not be very sorry to hear from me again , considering our long separation , I shall fill up this sheet before I go to bed .
I have heard something of a quarrel between your spouse and the Prince , I do n't wish to pry into family secrets or to hear anything more of the matter , but I ca n't help regretting on your account that so long an intimacy should be dissolved at the very moment when your husband might have derived some advantage from his R. H. 's friendship .
However , at all events , and in all Situations , you have a brother in me , and a home here .


I am led into this train of thinking by a part of your letter which hints at pecuniary losses .
I know how delicate one ought to be on such subjects , but you are probably the only being on Earth now interested in my welfare , certainly the only relative , and I should be very ungrateful if I did not feel the obligation .
You must excuse my being a little cynical , knowing how my temper was tried in my Non-age  the manner in which I was brought up must necessarily have broken a meek Spirit , or rendered a fiery one ungovernable  the effect it has had on mine I need not state .


However , buffeting with the World has brought me a little to reason , and two years travel in distant and barbarous countries has accustomed me to bear privations , and consequently to laugh at many things which would have made me angry before .
But I am wandering -- in short I only want to assure you that I love you , and that you must not think I am indifferent , because I do n't shew my affection in the usual way .


Pray ca n't you contrive to pay me a visit between this and Xmas ?
or shall I carry you down with me from Cambridge , supposing it practicable for me to come ?
You will do what you please , without our interfering with each other  the premises are so delightfully extensive , that two people might live together without ever seeing , hearing or meeting , -- but I ca n't feel the comfort of this till I marry .
In short it would be the most amiable matrimonial mansion , and that is another great inducement to my plan , -- my wife and I shall be so happy , -- one in each Wing .
If this description wo n't make you come , I ca n't tell what will , you must please yourself .
Good night , I have to walk half a mile to my Bed chamber .
Yours ever , BYRON .

-- To James Wedderburn Webster .


Newstead Abbey , Notts. , Aug ` st 31st , 1811 .


MY DEAR W. , -- I send you back your friend 's letter , and , though I do n't agree with his Canons of Criticism , they are not the worse for that .
My friend Hodgson [ 1 ] is not much honoured by the comparison to the ` Pursuits of L. ' , which is notoriously , as far as the ` poetry ' goes , the worst written of its kind  the World has been long but of one opinion , viz .
that it 's sole merit lies in the Notes , which are indisputably excellent .


Had Hodgson 's `` Alterative '' been placed with the ` Baviad ' the compliment had been higher to both  for , surely , the ` Baviad ' is as much superior to H. 's poem , as I do firmly believe H. 's poem to be to the ` Pursuits of Literature ' .


Your correspondent talks for talking 's sake when he says `` Lady J. Grey '' is neither `` Epic , dramatic , or legendary . ''
Who ever said it was `` epic '' or `` dramatic '' ?
he might as well say his letter was neither `` epic or dramatic  '' the poem makes no pretensions to either character .
`` Legendary '' it certainly is , but what has that to do with its merits ?
All stories of that kind founded on facts are in a certain degree legendary , but they may be well or ill written without the smallest alteration in that respect .
When Mr. Hare prattles about the `` Economy , '' etc. , he sinks sadly  -- all such expressions are the mere cant of a schoolboy hovering round the Skirts of Criticism .


Hodgson 's tale is one of the best efforts of his Muse , and Mr. H. 's approbation must be of more consequence , before any body will reduce it to a `` Scale , '' or be much affected by `` the place '' he `` assigns '' to the productions of a man like Hodgson .


But I have said more than I intended and only beg you never to allow yourself to be imposed upon by such `` common place '' as the 6th form letter you sent me .
Judge for yourself .


I know the Mr. Bankes [ 2 ] you mention though not to that `` extreme '' you seem to think , but I am flattered by his `` boasting '' on such a subject ( as you say ) , for I never thought him likely to `` boast '' of any thing which was not his own .
I am not '' ` melancholish ' '' -- pray what '' ` folk ' '' dare to say any such thing ?
I must contradict them by being ` merry ' at their expence .


I shall invade you in the course of the winter , out of envy , as Lucifer looked at Adam and Eve .


Pray be as happy as you can , and write to me that I may catch the infection .


Yours ever , BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Webster had sent Byron a letter from Naylor Hare , in which the latter criticized Hodgson 's poems , ` Lady Jane Grey , a Tale  and other Poems ( 1809 ) ' ( see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 195 , ` note 1 ' [ Footnote 1 of Letter 102 ] ) .


In the volume ( pp. 56-77 ) was printed his `` Gentle Alterative prepared for the Reviewers , '' which Hare apparently compared to ` The Pursuits of Literature ( 1794-97 ) ' , by T. J. Mathias .


To this criticism Byron objected , saying that the `` Alterative '' might be more fairly compared to Gifford 's ` Baviad ' ( 1794 ) . ]

[ 1 ]


Newstead Abbey , Sept. 2d , 1811 .


My dear Augusta , -- I wrote you a vastly dutiful letter since my answer to your second epistle , and I now write you a third , for which you have to thank Silence and Solitude .
Mr. Hanson [ 2 ] comes hither on the 14th , and I am going to Rochdale on business , but that need not prevent you from coming here , you will find Joe , and the house and the cellar and all therein very much at your Service .


As to Lady B. , when I discover one rich enough to suit me and foolish enough to have me , I will give her leave to make me miserable if she can .
Money is the magnet  as to Women , one is as well as another , the older the better , we have then a chance of getting her to Heaven .
So , your Spouse does not like brats better than myself  now those who beget them have no right to find fault , but I may rail with great propriety .


My `` Satire ! ''
-- I am glad it made you laugh for Somebody told me in Greece that you was angry , and I was sorry , as you were perhaps the only person whom I did not want to make angry .


But how you will make me laugh I do n't know , for it is a vastly serious subject to me I assure you  therefore take care , or I shall hitch you into the next Edition to make up our family party .
Nothing so fretful , so despicable as a Scribbler , see what I am , and what a parcel of Scoundrels I have brought about my ears , and what language I have been obliged to treat them with to deal with them in their own way  -- all this comes of Authorship , but now I am in for it , and shall be at war with Grubstreet , till I find some better amusement .


You will write to me your Intentions and may almost depend on my being at Cambridge in October .
You say you mean to be etc. in the Autumn  I should be glad to know what you call this present Season , it would be Winter in every other Country which I have seen .
If we meet in October we will travel in my Vis .
and can have a cage for the children and a cart for the Nurse .
Or perhaps we can forward them by the Canal .
Do let us know all about it , your `` bright thought '' is a little clouded , like the Moon in this preposterous climate .


Good even , Child .


Yours ever , B .


[ Footnote 1 : The following is Mrs. Leigh 's letter , to which the above is an answer :


`` 6 Mile Bottom , Saturday , 31 Aug. .


`` My dearest brother , -- I hope you do n't dislike receiving letters so much as writing them , for you would in that case pronounce me a great torment .
But as I prepared you in my last for its being followed very soon by another , I hope you will have reconciled your mind to the impending toil .
I really wrote in such a hurry that I did not say half I wished  but I did not like to delay telling you how happy you made me by writing .
I have been dwelling constantly upon the idea of going to Newstead ever since I had your wish to see me there .
At last a bright thought struck me .


`` We intend , I believe , to go to Yorkshire in the autumn .
Now , if I could contrive to pay you a visit en passant , it would be delightful , and give me the greatest pleasure .
But I fear you would be obliged to make up your mind to receive my Brats too .
As for my husband , he prefers the outside of the Mail to the inside of a Post-Chaise , particularly when partly occupied by Nurse and Children , so that we always travel independent of each other .


`` So much for this , my dear B. I can only say I should much like to see you at Newstead .
The former I hope I shall at all events , as you must not be shabby , but come to Cambridge as you promised .
Are you staying at Newstead now for any time ?
I saw George Byron in Town for one day , and he promised to call or write again , but has not done either , so I begin to think he has gone back to Lisbon .
I think it is impossible not to like him  he is so good-natured and natural .
We talked much of you  he told me you were grown very thin  as you do n't complain , I hope you are not the worse for being so , and I remember you used to wish it .
Do n't you think it a great shame that George B. is not promoted ?
I wish there was any possibility of assisting him about it  but all I know who could do any good with you present Ministers , I do n't for many reasons like to ask .
Perhaps there may be a change bye and bye .


`` Fred Howard is married to Miss Lambton .
I saw them in town in their way to Castle Howard .
I hope he will be happy with all my heart  his kindness and friendship to us last year , when Col. Leigh was placed in one of the most perplexing situations that I think anybody could be in , is never to be forgotten .
I think he used to be a greater favourite with you than some others of his family .
Mrs. F.H. is very pretty , very young ( not quite 17 ) , and appears gentle and pleasing , which is all one can expect [ to discover from ] a very slight acquaintance .


`` Now , my dearest Byron , pray let me hear from you .
I shall be daily expecting to hear of a Lady Byron , since you have confided to me your determination of marrying , in which I really hope you are serious , being convinced such an event would contribute greatly to your happiness , PROVIDED her Ladyship was the sort of person that would suit you  and you wo n't be angry with me for saying that it is not EVERY one who would  therefore do n't be too precipitate .
You will wish me hanged , I fear , for boring you so unmercifully , so God bless you , my dearest Bro.  and , when you have time , do write .
Are you going to amuse us with any more Satires ?
Oh , English Bards !
I shall make you laugh ( when we meet ) about it .

-- To Francis Hodgson .


Newstead Abbey , Sept. 3 , 1811 .


MY DEAR HODGSON , -- I will have nothing to do with your immortality  [ 1 ] we are miserable enough in this life , without the absurdity of speculating upon another .
If men are to live , why die at all ?
and if they die , why disturb the sweet and sound sleep that `` knows no waking '' ?


`` Post Mortem nihil est , ipsaque Mors nihil ... quaeris quo jaceas post obitum loco ?
Quo non Nata jacent . ''
[ 2 ]


As to revealed religion , Christ came to save men  but a good Pagan will go to heaven , and a bad Nazarene to hell  `` Argal '' ( I argue like the gravedigger ) why are not all men Christians ?
or why are any ?
If mankind may be saved who never heard or dreamt , at Timbuctoo , Otaheite , Terra Incognita , etc. , of Galilee and its Prophet , Christianity is of no avail : if they can not be saved without , why are not all orthodox ?
It is a little hard to send a man preaching to Judaea , and leave the rest of the world -- Negers and what not -- dark as their complexions , without a ray of light for so many years to lead them on high  and who will believe that God will damn men for not knowing what they were never taught ?
I hope I am sincere  I was so at least on a bed of sickness in a far-distant country , when I had neither friend , nor comforter , nor hope , to sustain me .
I looked to death as a relief from pain , without a wish for an after-life , but a confidence that the God who punishes in this existence had left that last asylum for the weary .


[ Greek : Hon ho theos agapaei apothnaeskei neos . ]
[ 3 ]


I am no Platonist , I am nothing at all  but I would sooner be a Paulician , Manichean , Spinozist , Gentile , Pyrrhonian , Zoroastrian , than one of the seventy-two villainous sects who are tearing each other to pieces for the love of the Lord and hatred of each other .
Talk of Galileeism ?
Show me the effects -- are you better , wiser , kinder by your precepts ?
I will bring you ten Mussulmans shall shame you in all goodwill towards men , prayer to God , and duty to their neighbours .
And is there a Talapoin , [ 4 ] or a Bonze , who is not superior to a fox-hunting curate ?
But I will say no more on this endless theme  let me live , well if possible , and die without pain .
The rest is with God , who assuredly , had He come or sent , would have made Himself manifest to nations , and intelligible to all .


I shall rejoice to see you .
My present intention is to accept Scrope Davies 's invitation  and then , if you accept mine , we shall meet here and there .
Did you know poor Matthews ?
I shall miss him much at Cambridge .


[ Footnote 1 : The religious discussion arose out of the opening stanzas of ` Childe Harold ' , Canto II. , which Hodgson was helping to correct for the press .


Byron 's opinions were not newly formed , as is shown by the following letter to Ensign Long ( see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 73 , ` note 2 ' [ Footnote 2 of Letter 31 ] ) , which reached the Editor too late for insertion in its proper place :


Southwell , Ap : 16th , 1807 .


`` Your Epistle , my dear Standard Bearer , augurs not much in favour of your new life , particularly the latter part , where you say your happiest Days are over .
I most sincerely hope not .
The past has certainly in some parts been pleasant , but I trust will be equalled , if not exceeded by the future .
You hope it is not so with me .


`` To be plain with Regard to myself .
Nature stampt me in the Die of Indifference .
I consider myself as destined never to be happy , although in some instances fortunate .
I am an isolated Being on the Earth , without a Tie to attach me to life , except a few School-fellows , and a ` score of females . '
Let me but ` hear my fame on the winds ' and the song of the Bards in my Norman house , I ask no more and do n't expect so much .
Of Religion I know nothing , at least in its ` favour ' .
We have ` fools ' in all sects and Impostors in most  why should I believe mysteries no one understands , because written by men who chose to mistake madness for Inspiration , and style themselves ` Evangelicals ? '
However enough on this subject .
Your ` piety ' will be ` aghast , ' and I wish for no proselytes .
This much I will venture to affirm , that all the virtues and pious ` Deeds ' performed on Earth can never entitle a man to Everlasting happiness in a future State  nor on the other hand can such a Scene as a Seat of eternal punishment exist , it is incompatible with the benign attributes of a Deity to suppose so .


`` I am surrounded here by parsons and methodists , but , as you will see , not infected with the mania .
I have lived a ` Deist ' , what I shall die I know not  however , come what may , ` ridens moriar ' .


`` Nothing detains me here but the publication , which will not be complete till June .
About 20 of the present pieces will be cut out , and a number of new things added .
Amongst them a complete Episode of Nisus and Euryalus from Virgil , some Odes from Anacreon , and several original Odes , the whole will cover 170 pages .
My last production has been a poem in imitation of Ossian , which I shall not publish , having enough without it .
Many of the present poems are enlarged and altered , in short you will behold an ` Old friend with a new face . '
Were I to publish all I have written in Rhyme , I should fill a decent Quarto  however , half is quite enough at present .
You shall have ` all ' when we meet .


`` I grow thin daily  since the commencement of my System I have lost 23 lbs .
in my weight ' ( i.e. ) ' 1 st. and 9 lbs .
When I began I weighed 14 st. 6 lbs. , and on Tuesday I found myself reduced to 12 st. 11 lb .
What sayest thou , Ned ?
do you not envy ?
I shall still proceed till I arrive at 12 st. and then stop , at least if I am not too fat , but shall always live temperately and take much exercise .


`` If there is a possibility we shall meet in June .
I shall be in Town , before I proceed to Granta , and if the ` mountain will not come to Mahomet , Mahomet will go to the mountain . '
I do n't mean , by comparing you to the mountain , to insinuate anything on the Subject of your Size .
Xerxes , it is said , formed Mount Athos into the Shape of a Woman  had he lived now , and taken a peep at Chatham , he would have spared himself the trouble and made it unnecessary by finding a ` Hill ' ready cut to his wishes .


`` Adieu , dear Mont Blanc , or rather ` Mont Rouge '  do n't , for Heaven 's sake , turn Volcanic , at least roll the Lava of your indignation in any other Channel , and not consume Your 's ever ,


`` BYRON .


`` Write Immediately . ''


Byron lived to modify these opinions , as is shown by the following passages from his ` Detached Thoughts ' :


`` If I were to live over again , I do not know what I would change in my life , unless it were ` for -- not to have lived at all ' .
All history and experience , and the rest , teaches us that the good and evil are pretty equally balanced in this existence , and that what is most to be desired is an easy passage out of it .
What can it give us but years ?
and those have little of good but their ending .


`` Of the immortality of the soul it appears to me that there can be little doubt , if we attend for a moment to the action of mind  it is in perpetual activity .
I used to doubt of it , but reflection has taught me better .
It acts also so very independent of body -- in dreams , for instance  -- incoherently and ` madly ' , I grant you , but still it is mind , and much more mind than when we are awake .
Now that this should not act ` separately ' , as well as jointly , who can pronounce ?
The stoics , Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius , call the present state ' a soul which drags a carcass , ' -- a heavy chain , to be sure  but all chains being material may be shaken off .
How far our future life will be ` individual ' , or , rather , how far it will at all resemble our ` present ' existence , is another question  but that the mind is eternal seems as probable as that the body is not so .
Of course I here venture upon the question without recurring to Revelation , which , however , is at least as rational a solution of it as any other .
A ` material ' resurrection seems strange , and even absurd , except for purposes of punishment  and all punishment which is to ` revenge ' rather than ` correct ' must be ` morally wrong '  and ` when the world is at an end ' , what moral or warning purpose ` can ' eternal tortures answer ?

`` Les Europeens les ont appeles ` talapoins ' , probablement du nom de l'eventail qu'ils tiennent a la main , lequel s ` appelle ` talapat ' , qui signifie ` feuille de palmier ' . ''


Possibly Byron knew the word through Voltaire ( ` Dial . '

-- To R.C. Dallas .


Newstead Abbey , September 4th , 1811 .


My dear Sir , -- I am at present anxious , as Cawthorn seems to wish it , to have a small edition of the ` Hints from Horace ' [ 1 ] published immediately , but the Latin ( the most difficult poem in the language ) renders it necessary to be very particular not only in correcting the proofs with Horace open , but in adapting the parallel passages of the imitation in such places to the original as may enable the reader not to lose sight of the allusion .
I do n't know whether I ought to ask you to do this , but I am too far off to do it for myself  and if you condescend to my school-boy erudition , you will oblige me by setting this thing going , though you will smile at the importance I attach to it .


Believe me , ever yours ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : ` Hints from Horace ' , written during Byron 's second stay at Athens , March 11-14 , 1811 , and subsequently added to , had been placed in the hands of Cawthorn , the publisher of ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ' , for publication .
Byron afterwards changed his mind , and the poem remained unpublished till after his death .


The following letter from Cawthorn shows that considerable progress had been made with the printing of the poem , and that Byron also contemplated another edition of ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ' .
The advice of his friends led him to abandon both plans  but his letter to Cawthorn , printed below , is evidence that in September he was still at work on ` Hints from Horace ' :


`` 24 , Cockspur Street , Aug. 22'd , 1811 .


`` My Lord , -- Mr. Green the Amanuensis has finished the Latin of the Horace , and I shall be happy to do with it as your Lordship may direct , either to forward it to Newstead , or keep it in Town .
Would it not be better to print a small edition seperate ( ` sic ' ) , and afterwards print the two satires together ?
This I leave to your Lordship 's consideration .
Four Sheets of the ` Travels ' are already printed , and one of the plates ( Albanian Solain ) is executed .
I sent it Capt. H [ obhouse ] yesterday to Cork , to see if it meets his approbation .
The work is printed in quarto , for which I may be in some measure indebted to your Lordship , as I urged it so strongly .
I shall be extremely sorry if Capt. H. is not pleased with it , but I think he will .
Your Lordship 's goodness will excuse me for saying how much the very sudden and melancholy events that have lately transpired -- I regret -- Capt. Hobhouse has written me since the decease of Mr. Mathews .
I am told Capt. H. is very much affected at it .
I have received some drawings of costumes from him , which I am to deliver to your Lordship .
Is it likely we shall see your Lordship in Town soon ?


`` I have the honour to be your Lordship 's


`` Most respectful and greatly obliged Servt. ,


`` JAMES CAWTHORN .


`` If a small edition is printed of ` Horace ' for the first '' [ words erased ] `` that , and I think in all probability the ` E. Bards ' will want reprinting about March next , when both could be done together .
Do not think me too sanguine . ''


A few days later , Byron writes to Cawthom as follows :


`` Newstead Abbey , September 4th , 1811 .


`` More notes for the ` Hints ' !
You mistake me much by thinking me inattentive to this publication .
If I had a friend willing and able to correct the press , it should be out with my good will immediately .
Pray attend to annexing additional notes in their proper places , and let them be added immediately .


`` Yours , etc. ,


`` BYRON . '' ]

-- To John Murray .
[ 1 ]


Newstead Abbey , Notts. , Sept. 5 , 1811 .


SIR , -- The time seems to be past when ( as Dr. Johnson said ) a man was certain to `` hear the truth from his bookseller , '' for you have paid me so many compliments , that , if I was not the veriest scribbler on earth , I should feel affronted .
As I accept your compliments , it is but fair I should give equal or greater credit to your objections , the more so as I believe them to be well founded .
With regard to the political and metaphysical parts , I am afraid I can alter nothing  but I have high authority for my Errors in that point , for even the ` AEneid ' was a political poem , and written for a political purpose  and as to my unlucky opinions on Subjects of more importance , I am too sincere in them for recantation .
On Spanish affairs I have said what I saw , and every day confirms me in that notion of the result formed on the Spot  and I rather think honest John Bull is beginning to come round again to that Sobriety which Massena 's retreat [ 2 ] had begun to reel from its centre -- the usual consequence of unusual success .
So you perceive I can not alter the Sentiments  but if there are any alterations in the structure of the versification you would wish to be made , I will tag rhymes and turn stanzas as much as you please .
As for the `` Orthodox , '' let us hope they will buy , on purpose to abuse -- you will forgive the one , if they will do the other .
You are aware that any thing from my pen must expect no quarter , on many accounts  and as the present publication is of a nature very different from the former , we must not be sanguine .


You have given me no answer to my question -- tell me fairly , did you show the MS. to some of your corps ?
[ 3 ]


I sent an introductory stanza to Mr. Dallas , that it might be forwarded to you  the poem else will open too abruptly .
The Stanzas had better be numbered in Roman characters , there is a disquisition on the literature of the modern Greeks , and some smaller poems to come in at the close .
These are now at Newstead , but will be sent in time .
If Mr. D. has lost the Stanza and note annexed to it , write , and I will send it myself .
-- You tell me to add two cantos , but I am about to visit my Collieries in Lancashire on the 15th instant , which is so unpoetical an employment that I need say no more .


I am , sir , your most obedient , etc. , etc. ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : The following is Murray 's letter , to which Byron replies :


`` London , Sept. 4 , 1811 , Wednesday .


`` MY LORD , -- An absence of some days , passed in the country , has prevented me from writing earlier in answer to your obliging letter .
I have now , however , the pleasure of sending under a separate cover , the first proof sheet of your Lordship 's ` Poem ' , which is so good as to be entitled to all your care to render perfect .
Besides its general merit , there are parts , which , I am tempted to believe , far excel anything that your Lordship has hitherto published , and it were therefore grievous indeed , if you do not condescend to bestow upon it all the improvement of which your Lordship 's mind is so capable  every correction already made is valuable , and this circumstance renders me more confident in soliciting for it your further attention .


`` There are some expressions , too , concerning Spain and Portugal , which , however just , and particularly so at the time they were conceived , yet as they do not harmonize with the general feeling , would so greatly interfere with the popularity which the poem is , in other respects , so certainly calculated to excite , that , in compassion to your publisher , who does not presume to reason upon the subject , otherwise than as a mere matter of business , I hope your Lordship 's goodness will induce you to obviate them , and , with them , perhaps , some religious feelings which may deprive me of some customers amongst the ` Orthodox ' .


`` Could I flatter myself that these suggestions were not obtrusive , I would hazard another , in an earnest solicitation that your Lordship would add the two promised Cantos , and complete the ` Poem ' .
It were cruel indeed not to perfect a work which contains so much that is excellent  your Fame , my Lord , demands it  you are raising a Monument that will outlive your present feelings , and it should therefore be so constructed as to excite no other associations than those of respect and admiration for your Lordship 's Character and Genius .


`` I trust that you will pardon the warmth of this address when I assure your Lordship that it arises , in the greatest degree , in a sincere regard for your lasting reputation , with , however , some view to that portion of it , which must attend the Publisher of so beautiful a Poem , as your Lordship is capable of rendering


'' ` The Romaunt of Childe Harold ' .


`` I have the honour to be , My Lord ,


`` Your Lordship 's

`` JOHN MURRAY . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : On the night of March 5 , 1811 , Massena retreated from his camp at Santarem , whence he had watched Wellington at Torres Vedras , and on April 4 he crossed the Coa into Spain . ]


[ Footnote 3 : Murray had shown the MS. to Gifford for advice as to its publication .
Byron seems to have resented this on the ground that it might look like an attempt to propitiate the ` Quarterly Review ' . ]


* * * * *


180 .
-- To R. C. Dallas .


Newstead Abbey , September 7 , 1811 .


As Gifford has been ever my `` Magnus Apollo , '' any approbation , such as you mention , would , of course , be more welcome than `` all Bocara 's vaunted gold '' , than all `` the gems of Samarcand . ''
[ 1 ] But I am sorry the MS. was shown to him in such a manner , and had written to Murray to say as much , before I was aware that it was too late .


Your objection to the expression `` central line '' I can only meet by saying that , before Childe Harold left England , it was his full intention to traverse Persia , and return by India , which he could not have done without passing the equinoctial .


The other errors you mention , I must correct in the progress through the press .
I feel honoured by the wish of such men that the poem should be continued , but to do that I must return to Greece and Asia  I must have a warm sun , a blue sky  I can not describe scenes so dear to me by a sea-coal fire .
I had projected an additional canto when I was in the Troad and Constantinople , and if I saw them again , it would go on  but under existing circumstances and ` sensations ' , I have neither harp , `` heart , nor voice '' to proceed , I feel that ` you are all right ' as to the metaphysical part  but I also feel that I am sincere , and that if I am only to write `` ad captandum vulgus , '' I might as well edit a magazine at once , or spin canzonettas for Vauxhall .
[ 2 ]


My work must make its way as well as it can  I know I have every thing against me , angry poets and prejudices  but if the poem is a ` poem ' , it will surmount these obstacles , and if ` not ' , it deserves its fate .
Your friend 's Ode [ 3 ] I have read -- it is no great compliment to pronounce it far superior to Smythe 's on the same subject , or to the merits of the new Chancellor .
It is evidently the production of a man of taste , and a poet , though I should not be willing to say it was fully equal to what might be expected from the author of '' ` Horae Ionicae ' . ''
[ 4 ] I thank you for it , and that is more than I would do for any other Ode of the present day .


I am very sensible of your good wishes , and , indeed , I have need of them .
My whole life has been at variance with propriety , not to say decency  my circumstances are become involved  my friends are dead or estranged , and my existence a dreary void .
In Matthews I have lost my `` guide , philosopher , and friend  '' in Wingfield a friend only , but one whom I could have wished to have preceded in his long journey .


Matthews was indeed an extraordinary man  it has not entered into the heart of a stranger to conceive such a man : there was the stamp of immortality in all he said or did  -- and now what is he ?
When we see such men pass away and be no more -- men , who seem created to display what the Creator ` could make ' his creatures , gathered into corruption , before the maturity of minds that might have been the pride of posterity , what are we to conclude ?
For my own part , I am bewildered .
To me he was much , to Hobhouse every thing .
My poor Hobhouse doted on Matthews .
For me , I did not love quite so much as I honoured him  I was indeed so sensible of his infinite superiority , that though I did not envy , I stood in awe of it .
He , Hobhouse , Davies , and myself , formed a coterie of our own at Cambridge and elsewhere .
Davies is a wit and man of the world , and feels as much as such a character can do  but not as Hobhouse has been affected .
Davies , who is not a scribbler , has always beaten us all in the war of words , and by his colloquial powers at once delighted and kept us in order .
Hobhouse and myself always had the worst of it with the other two  and even Matthews yielded to the dashing vivacity of Scrope Davies .
But I am talking to you of men , or boys , as if you cared about such beings .


I expect mine agent down on the 14th to proceed to Lancashire , where I hear from all quarters that I have a very valuable property in coals , etc. .
I then intend to accept an invitation to Cambridge in October , and shall , perhaps , run up to town .
I have four invitations -- to Wales , Dorset , Cambridge , and Chester  but I must be a man of business .
I am quite alone , as these long letters sadly testify .
I perceive , by referring to your letter , that the Ode is from the author  make my thanks acceptable to him .
His muse is worthy a nobler theme .
You will write as usual , I hope .
I wish you good evening , and am , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : The lines , which are parodied in Byron 's unpublished ` Barmaid ' , are from Sir W. Jones 's translation of a song by Hafiz ( ` Works , vol .

-- To the Hon. Augusta Leigh .


[ Six Mile Bottom , Newmarket . ]


Newstead Abbey , Sept. 9th , 1811 .


My Dear Augusta , -- My Rochdale affairs are understood to be settled as far as the Law can settle them , and indeed I am told that the most valuable part is that which was never disputed  but I have never reaped any advantage from them , and God knows if I ever shall .
Mr. H. , my agent , is a good man and able , but the most dilatory in the world .
I expect him down on the 14th to accompany me to Rochdale , where something will be decided as to selling or working the Collieries .
I am Lord of the Manor ( a most extensive one ) , and they want to enclose , which can not be done without me  but I go there in the worst humour possible and am afraid I shall do or say something not very conciliatory .
In short all my affairs are going on as badly as possible , and I have no hopes or plans to better them as I long ago pledged myself never to sell Newstead , which I mean to hold in defiance of the Devil and Man .


I am quite alone and never see strangers without being sick , but I am nevertheless on good terms with my neighbours , for I neither ride or shoot or move over my Garden walls , but I fence and box and swim and run a good deal to keep me in exercise and get me to sleep .
Poor Murray is ill again , and one of my Greek servants is ill too , and my valet has got a pestilent cough , so that we are in a peck of troubles  my family Surgeon sent an Emetic this morning for one of them , I did not very well know which , but I swore Somebody should take it , so after a deal of discussion the Greek swallowed it with tears in his eyes , and by the blessing of it , and the Virgin whom he invoked to assist it and him , I suppose he 'll be well tomorrow , if not , another shall have the next .
So your Spouse likes children , that is lucky as he will have to bring them up  for my part ( since I lost my Newfoundland dog , ) I like nobody except his successor a Dutch Mastiff and three land Tortoises brought with me from Greece .


I thank you for your letters and am always glad to hear from you , but if you wo n't come here before Xmas , I very much fear we shall not meet here at all , for I shall be off somewhere or other very soon out of this land of Paper credit ( or rather no credit at all , for every body seems on the high road to Bankruptcy ) , and if I quit it again I shall not be back in a hurry .


However , I shall endeavour to see you somewhere , and make my bow with decorum before I return to the Ottomans , I believe I shall turn Mussulman in the end .


You ask after my health  I am in tolerable leanness , which I promote by exercise and abstinence .
I do n't know that I have acquired any thing by my travels but a smattering of two languages and a habit of chewing Tobacco .
[ 1 ]


Yours ever ,


B .


[ Footnote 1 : To appease the pangs of hunger , and keep down his fat , Byron was in the habit of chewing gum-mastic and tobacco .
For the same reason , at a later date , he took opium .
The mistake which he makes in his letter to Hodgson ( December 8,1811 ) , `` I do nothing but eschew tobacco , '' is repeated in ` Don Juan ' ( Canto XII .
stanza xiiii . )
--


`` In fact , there 's nothing makes me so much grieve , As that abominable tittle-tattle , Which is the cud eschewed by human cattle . '' ]

-- To Francis Hodgson .


Newstead Abbey , Sept. 9 , 1811 .


Dear Hodgson , -- I have been a good deal in your company lately , for I have been reading ` Juvenal ' and ` Lady Jane ' , [ 1 ] etc. , for the first time since my return .
The Tenth Sat ' e has always been my favourite , as I suppose indeed of everybody 's .
It is the finest recipe for making one miserable with his life , and content to walk out of it , in any language .
I should think it might be redde with great effect to a man dying without much pain , in preference to all the stuff that ever was said or sung in churches .
But you are a deacon , and I say no more .
Ah !
you will marry and become lethargic , like poor Hal of Harrow , [ 2 ] who yawns at 10 o ' nights , and orders caudle annually .


I wrote an answer to yours fully some days ago , and , being quite alone and able to frank , you must excuse this subsequent epistle , which will cost nothing but the trouble of deciphering .
I am expectant of agents to accompany me to Rochdale , a journey not to be anticipated with pleasure  though I feel very restless where I am , and shall probably ship off for Greece again  what nonsense it is to talk of Soul , when a cloud makes it melancholy and wine makes it mad .


Collet of Staines , your `` most kind host , '' has lost that girl you saw of his .
She grew to five feet eleven , and might have been God knows how high if it had pleased Him to renew the race of Anak  but she fell by a ptisick , a fresh proof of the folly of begetting children .
You knew Matthews .
Was he not an intellectual giant ?
I knew few better or more intimately , and none who deserved more admiration in point of ability .


Scrope Davies has been here on his way to Harrowgate  I am his guest in October at King 's , where we will `` drink deep ere we depart . ''
`` Wo n't you , wo n't you , wo n't you , wo n't you come , Mr. Mug ? ''
[ 3 ] We did not amalgamate properly at Harrow  it was somehow rainy , and then a wife makes such a damp  but in a seat of celibacy I will have revenge .
Do n't you hate helping first , and losing the wings of chicken ?
And then , conversation is always flabby .
Oh !
in the East women are in their proper sphere , and one has -- no conversation at all .
My house here is a delightful matrimonial mansion .
When I wed , my spouse and I will be so happy !
-- one in each wing .


I presume you are in motion from your Herefordshire station , [ 4 ] and Drury must be gone back to Gerund Grinding .
I have not been at Cambridge since I took my M.A. degree in 1808 .
Eheu fugaces !
I look forward to meeting you and Scrope there with the feelings of other times .
Capt. Hobhouse is at Enniscorthy in Juverna .
I wish he was in England .


Yours ever ,

Dear Sir , -- I rather think in one of the opening stanzas of ` Childe Harold ' there is this line :

Now , a line or two after , I have a repetition of the epithet `` sullen reverie  '' so ( if it be so ) let us have `` speechless reverie , '' or `` silent reverie  '' but , at all events , do away the recurrence .

-- To Francis Hodgson .


Newstead Abbey , September 13 , 1811 .


My Dear Hodgson , -- I thank you for your song , or , rather , your two songs , -- your new song on love , and your old song on religion .
[ 1 ] I admire the first sincerely , and in turn call upon you to admire the following on Anacreon Moore 's new operatic farce , [ 2 ] or farcical opera -- call it which you will :


Good plays are scarce , So Moore writes Farce  Is Fame like his so brittle ?
We knew before That `` Little 's '' Moore , But now 't is Moore that 's Little .


I wo n't dispute with you on the Arcana of your new calling  they are Bagatelles like the King of Poland 's rosary .
One remark , and I have done  the basis of your religion is injustice  the Son of God , the pure , the immaculate , the innocent , is sacrificed for the Guilty .
This proves His heroism  but no more does away man 's guilt than a schoolboy 's volunteering to be flogged for another would exculpate the dunce from negligence , or preserve him from the Rod .
You degrade the Creator , in the first place , by making Him a begetter of children  and in the next you convert Him into a Tyrant over an immaculate and injured Being , who is sent into existence to suffer death for the benefit of some millions of Scoundrels , who , after all , seem as likely to be damned as ever .
As to miracles , I agree with Hume that it is more probable men should lie or be deceived , than that things out of the course of Nature should so happen .
Mahomet wrought miracles , Brothers [ 3 ] the prophet had proselytes , and so would Breslaw [ 4 ] the conjuror , had he lived in the time of Tiberius .


Besides I trust that God is not a Jew , but the God of all Mankind  and as you allow that a virtuous Gentile may be saved , you do away the necessity of being a Jew or a Christian .


I do not believe in any revealed religion , because no religion is revealed : and if it pleases the Church to damn me for not allowing a nonentity , I throw myself on the mercy of the `` Great First Cause , least understood , '' who must do what is most proper  though I conceive He never made anything to be tortured in another life , whatever it may in this .
I will neither read pro nor con .
God would have made His will known without books , considering how very few could read them when Jesus of Nazareth lived , had it been His pleasure to ratify any peculiar mode of worship .
As to your immortality , if people are to live , why die ?
And our carcases , which are to rise again , are they worth raising ?
I hope , if mine is , that I shall have a better pair of legs than I have moved on these two-and-twenty years , or I shall be sadly behind in the squeeze into Paradise .
Did you ever read `` Malthus on Population '' ?
If he be right , war and pestilence are our best friends , to save us from being eaten alive , in this `` best of all possible Worlds . ''
[ 5 ]


I will write , read , and think no more  indeed , I do not wish to shock your prejudices by saying all I do think .
Let us make the most of life , and leave dreams to Emanuel Swedenborg .
Now to dreams of another genus -- Poesies .
I like your song much  but I will say no more , for fear you should think I wanted to scratch you into approbation of my past , present , or future acrostics .
I shall not be at Cambridge before the middle of October  but , when I go , I should certes like to see you there before you are dubbed a deacon .
Write to me , and I will rejoin .


Yours ever , BYRON .

Hodgson replies ( September 18 , 1811 ) :


`` Your last letter has unfeignedly grieved me .
Believing , as I do from my heart , that you would be better and happier by thoroughly examining the evidences for Christianity , how can I hear you say you will not read any book on the subject , without being pained ?
But God bless you under all circumstances .
I will say no more .
Only do not talk of ` shocking my prejudices , ' or of ` rushing to see me ` before ' I am a Deacon . '
I wish to see you at all times  and as to our different opinions , we can easily keep them to ourselves . ''


The next day he writes again :


`` Let me make one other effort .
You mentioned an opinion of Hume 's about miracles .
For God 's sake , -- hear me , Byron , for God 's sake -- examine Paley 's answer to that opinion  examine the whole of Paley 's ` Evidences ' .
The two volumes may be read carefully in less than a week .
Let me for the last time by our friendship , implore you to read them . '' ]

-- To John Murray .
[ 1 ]


Newstead Abbey , Notts. , Sept. 14 , 1811 .


Sir , -- Since your former letter , Mr. Dallas informs me that the MS. has been submitted to the perusal of Mr. Gifford , most contrary to my wishes , as Mr. D. could have explained , and as my own letter to you did , in fact , explain , with my motives for objecting to such a proceeding .
Some late domestic events , of which you are probably aware , prevented my letter from being sent before  indeed , I hardly conceived you would have so hastily thrust my productions into the hands of a Stranger , who could be as little pleased by receiving them , as their author is at their being offered , in such a manner , and to such a Man .


My address , when I leave Newstead , will be to `` Rochdale , Lancashire  '' but I have not yet fixed the day of departure , and I will apprise you when ready to set off .


You have placed me in a very ridiculous situation , but it is past , and nothing more is to be said on the subject .
You hinted to me that you wished some alterations to be made  if they have nothing to do with politics or religion , I will make them with great readiness .


I am , Sir , etc. , etc. , BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : As soon as Byron came to town , he was a frequent visitor at 32 , Fleet Street , while the sheets of ` Childe Harold ' were passing through the press .


`` Fresh from the fencing rooms of Angelo and Jackson , he used to amuse himself by renewing his practice of ` Carte et Tierce ' , with his walking-cane directed against the bookshelves , while Murray was reading passages from the poem with occasional ejaculations of admiration , on which Byron would say , ` You think that a good idea , do you , Murray ? '
Then he would fence and lunge with his walking-stick at some special book which he had picked out on the shelves before him .
As Murray afterwards said , ' I was often very glad to get rid of him ! ' ''

Newstead Abbey , Sept. 15 , 1811 .


My dear Sir , -- My agent will not he here for at least a week , and even afterwards my letters will be forwarded to Rochdale .
I am sorry that Murray should groan on my account , tho ' that is better than the anticipation of applause , of which men and books are generally disappointed .


The notes I sent are merely matter to be divided , arranged , and published for notes hereafter , in proper places  at present I am too much occupied with earthly cares to waste time or trouble upon rhyme , or its modern indispensables , annotations .


Pray let me hear from you , when at leisure .
I have written to abuse Murray for showing the MS. to Mr. G. , who must certainly think it was done by my wish , though you know the contrary .
-- Believe me , Yours ever , B --

Newstead Abbey , Sept. 16 , 1811 .


DEAR SIR , -- I return the proof , which I should wish to be shown to Mr. Dallas , who understands typographical arrangements much better than I can pretend to do .
The printer may place the notes in his own way , or any way , so that they are out of my way  I care nothing about types or margins .


If you have any communication to make , I shall be here at least a week or ten days longer .
I am , Sir , etc. , etc. ,


BYRON .

Newstead Abbey , Sept. 16 , 1811 .


DEAR SIR , -- I send you a ` motto ' :


`` L'univers est une espece de livre , dont on n ' a lu que la premiere page quand on n ' a vu que son pays .
J'en ai feuillete un assez grand nombre , que j' ai trouve egalement mauvaises .
Cet examen ne m ' a point ete infructueux .
Je haissais ma patrie .
Toutes les impertinences des peuples divers , parmi lesquels j' ai vecu , m ` ont reconcilie avec elle .
Quand je n'aurais tire d'autre benefice de mes voyages que celui-la , je n'en regretterais ni les frais , ni les fatigues . ''


`` Le Cosmopolite . ''
[ 1 ]


If not too long , I think it will suit the book .
The passage is from a little French volume , a great favourite with me , which I picked up in the Archipelago .
I do n't think it is well known in England  Monbron is the author  but it is a work sixty years old .


Good morning !
I wo n't take up your time .


Yours ever , BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Fougeret de Monbron , born at Peronne , served in the ` Gardes du Corps ' , but abandoned the sword for the pen , and published ` Henriade Travestie ' ( 1745 )  ` Preservatif Centre l'Anglomanie ' ( 1787 )  and ` Le Cosmopolite ' ( 1750 ) .
His novels , ` Margot la Ravaudeuse , Therlse Philosophe ' , and others , appeared under the name of Fougeret .
He died in 1761 .
In that year was published in London an edition of ` Le Cosmopolite , ou le Citoyen du Monde ' , par Mr. de Monbron , with the motto , `` Patria est ubicunque est bene '' ( Cic .
5 , Tusc .
37 ) .


Byron 's quotation is the opening paragraph of the book .
The author , who had travelled in England , returns to France a complete `` Jacques Rot-de-Bif . ''
He then visits Holland , the Low Countries , Constantinople , Italy , Spain , Portugal , and England a second time .
He finds that the charm has vanished , and that the English are no better than their neighbours .
It is a cynical little book , abounding in such sayings as .
`` Make acquaintances , not friends  intimacy breeds disgust  '' `` The best fruit of travelling is the justification of instinctive dislikes . ''
Monbron , like Byron , ridicules the traveller 's passion for collecting broken statues and antiques . ]

Newstead Abbey , Sept. 17 , 1811 .


I can easily excuse your not writing , as you have , I hope , something better to do , and you must pardon my frequent invasions on your attention , because I have at this moment nothing to interpose between you and my epistles .


I can not settle to any thing , and my days pass , with the exception of bodily exercise to some extent , with uniform indolence , and idle insipidity .
I have been expecting , and still expect , my agent , when I shall have enough to occupy my reflections in business of no very pleasant aspect .
Before my journey to Rochdale , you shall have due notice where to address me -- I believe at the post-office of that township .
From Murray I received a second proof of the same pages , which I requested him to show you , that any thing which may have escaped my observation may be detected before the printer lays the corner-stone of an errata column .


I am now not quite alone , having an old acquaintance and school-fellow [ 1 ] with me , so old , indeed , that we have nothing new to say on any subject , and yawn at each other in a sort of quiet inquietude .
I hear nothing from Cawthorn , or Captain Hobhouse  and their quarto -- Lord have mercy on mankind !
We come on like Cerberus with our triple publications .
[ 2 ] As for myself , by myself , I must be satisfied with a comparison to Janus .


I am not at all pleased with Murray for showing the MS.  and I am certain Gifford must see it in the same light that I do .
His praise is nothing to the purpose : what could he say ?
He could not spit in the face of one who had praised him in every possible way .
I must own that I wish to have the impression removed from his mind , that I had any concern in such a paltry transaction .
The more I think , the more it disquiets me  so I will say no more about it .
It is bad enough to be a scribbler , without having recourse to such shifts to extort praise , or deprecate censure .
It is anticipating , it is begging , kneeling , adulating , -- the devil !
the devil !
the devil !
and all without my wish , and contrary to my express desire .
I wish Murray had been tied to Payne 's neck when he jumped into the Paddington Canal , [ 3 ] and so tell him , -- that is the proper receptacle for publishers .
You have thought of settling in the country , why not try Notts . ?
I think there are places which would suit you in all points , and then you are nearer the metropolis .
But of this anon .


I am , yours , etc. , BYRON .

[ Footnote 2 : i. e. ` Childe Harold ' , ` Hints from Horace ' , and ` Travels in Albania . ' ]


[ Footnote 3 : Mr. Payne , of the firm of Payne and Mackinlay , the publishers of Hodgson 's ` Juvenal ' , committed suicide by drowning himself in the Paddington Canal .
Byron , in a note to ` Hints from Horace ' , line 657 , thus applies the incident :


`` A literary friend of mine , walking out one lovely evening last summer , on the eleventh bridge of the Paddington canal , was alarmed by the cry of ` one in jeopardy : ' he rushed along , collected a body of Irish haymakers ( supping on buttermilk in an adjacent paddock ) , procured three rakes , one eel spear and a landing-net , and at last ( ` horresco referens ' ) pulled out -- his own publisher .
The unfortunate man was gone for ever , and so was a large quarto wherewith he had taken the leap , which proved , on inquiry , to have been Mr. Southey 's last work .
Its ` alacrity of sinking ' was so great , that it has never since been heard of  though some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch 's pastry-premises , Cornhill .
Be this as it may , the coroner 's inquest brought in a verdict of '' Felo de Bibliopola '' against a quarto unknown , ' and circumstantial evidence being since strong against the ` Curse of Kehama ' ( of which the above words are an exact description ) , it will be tried by its peers next session , in Grub Street -- Arthur , Alfred , Davideis , Richard Coeur de Lion , Exodus , Exodiad , Epigoniad , Calvary , Fall of Cambria , Siege of Acre , Don Roderick , and Tom Thumb the Great , are the names of the twelve jurors .
The judges are Pye , Bowles , and the bell-man of St. Sepulchre 's . ''

Dear Sir , -- I have just discovered some pages of observations on the modern Greeks , written at Athens by me , under the title of ` Noctes Atticae ' .
They will do to cut up into notes , and to be cut up afterwards , which is all that notes are generally good for .
They were written at Athens , as you will see by the date .


Yours ever , B .

Newstead Abbey , Sept , 21 , 1811 .


I have shown my respect for your suggestions by adopting them  but I have made many alterations in the first proof , over and above  as , for example :


Oh Thou , in Hellas deem'd of heavenly birth , etc. , etc. .


Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth , Mine , etc. .


Yet there I 've wandered by the vaunted rill 


and so on .
So I have got rid of Dr. Lowth and `` drunk '' to boot , and very glad I am to say so .
I have also sullenised the line as heretofore , and in short have been quite conformable .


Pray write  you shall hear when I remove to Lancashire .
I have brought you and my friend Juvenal Hodgson upon my back , on the score of revelation .
You are fervent , but he is quite glowing  and if he take half the pains to save his own soul , which he volunteers to redeem mine , great will be his reward hereafter .
I honour and thank you both , but am convinced by neither .
Now for notes .
Besides those I have sent , I shall send the observations on the Edinburgh Reviewer 's remarks on the modern Greek , an Albanian song in the Albanian ( not Greek ) language , specimens of modern Greek from their New Testament , a comedy of Goldoni 's translated , one scene , a prospectus of a friend 's book , and perhaps a song or two , all in Romaic , besides their Pater Noster  so there will be enough , if not too much , with what I have already sent .
Have you received the `` Noctes Atticae '' ?


I sent also an annotation on Portugal .
Hobhouse is also forthcoming .

Newstead Abbey , Sept. 23 , 1811 .


Lisboa [ 1 ] is the Portuguese word , consequently the very best .
Ulissipont is pedantic  and as I have Hellas and Eros not long before , there would be something like an affectation of Greek terms , which I wish to avoid , since I shall have a perilous quantity of modern Greek in my notes , as specimens of the tongue  therefore Lisboa may keep its place .
You are right about the Hints  they must not precede the Romaunt  but Cawthorn will be savage if they do n't  however , keep them back , and him in good humour , if we can , but do not let him publish .


I have adopted , I believe , most of your suggestions , but `` Lisboa '' will be an exception to prove the rule .
I have sent a quantity of notes , and shall continue  but pray let them be copied  no devil can read my hand .
By the by , I do not mean to exchange the ninth verse of the `` Good Night . ''
[ 2 ] I have no reason to suppose my dog better than his brother brutes , mankind  and Argus we know to be a fable .
The Cosmopolite was an acquisition abroad .
I do not believe it is to be found in England .
It is an amusing little volume , and full of French flippancy .
I read , though I do not speak the language .


I will be angry with Murray .
It was a bookselling , back-shop , Paternoster-row , paltry proceeding  and if the experiment had turned out as it deserved , I would have raised all Fleet Street , and borrowed the giant 's staff from St. Dunstan 's church , [ 3 ] to immolate the betrayer of trust .
I have written to him as he never was written to before by an author , I 'll be sworn , and I hope you will amplify my wrath , till it has an effect upon him .
You tell me always you have much to write about .
Write it , but let us drop metaphysics  -- on that point we shall never agree .
I am dull and drowsy , as usual .
I do nothing , and even that nothing fatigues me .


Adieu .


[ Footnote 1 : See ` Childe Harold ' , Canto I. stanza xvi. , and Byron 's ` note ' . ]


[ Footnote 2 : See ` Childe Harold ' , Canto I .
The `` Good Night '' is placed between stanzas xiii .
and xiv .


`` And now I 'm in the world alone , Upon the wide , wide sea  But why should I for others groan , When none will sigh for me ?
Perchance my dog will whine in vain , Till fed by stranger hands  But long ere I come back again He 'd tear me where he stands . '' ]


[ Footnote 3 : St. Dunstan 's in the West , before its rebuilding by Shaw ( 1831-33 ) , was one of the oldest churches in London .
The clock , which projected over the street , and had two wooden figures of wild men who struck the hours with their clubs , was set up in 1671 .
Unless there was a similar clock before this date , as is not improbable , Scott is wrong in ` The Fortunes of Nigel ' , where he makes Moniplies stand `` astonished as old Adam and Eve ply their ding-dong . ''
The figures , the removal of which , it is said , brought tears to the eyes of Charles Lamb , were bought by the Marquis of Hertford to adorn his villa in Regent 's Park , still called St. Dunstan 's .
Murray 's shop at 32 , Fleet Street , stood opposite the church , the yard of which was surrounded with stationers ' shops , where many famous books of the seventeenth century were published . ]

MY DEAR HODGSON , -- I fear that before the latest of October or the first of November , I shall hardly be able to make Cambridge .
My everlasting agent puts off his coming like the accomplishment of a prophecy .
However , finding me growing serious he hath promised to be here on Thursday , and about Monday we shall remove to Rochdale .
I have only to give discharges to the tenantry here ( it seems the poor creatures must be raised , though I wish it was not necessary ) , and arrange the receipt of sums , and the liquidation of some debts , and I shall be ready to enter upon new subjects of vexation .
I intend to visit you in Granta , and hope to prevail on you to accompany me here or there or anywhere .


I am plucking up my spirits , and have begun to gather my little sensual comforts together .
Lucy is extracted from Warwickshire  some very bad faces have been warned off the premises , and more promising substituted in their stead  the partridges are plentiful , hares fairish , pheasants not quite so good , and the Girls on the Manor * * * * Just as I had formed a tolerable establishment my travels commenced , and on my return I find all to do over again  my former flock were all scattered  some married , not before it was needful .
As I am a great disciplinarian , I have just issued an edict for the abolition of caps  no hair to be cut on any pretext  stays permitted , but not too low before  full uniform always in the evening  Lucinda to be commander -- ` vice ' the present , about to be wedded ( ` mem ' .
she is 35 with a flat face and a squeaking voice ) , of all the makers and unmakers of beds in the household .


My tortoises ( all Athenians ) , my hedgehog , my mastiff and the other live Greek , are all purely .
The tortoises lay eggs , and I have hired a hen to hatch them .
I am writing notes for ` my ' quarto ( Murray would have it a ` quarto ' ) , and Hobhouse is writing text for ` his ' quarto  if you call on Murray or Cawthorn you will hear news of either .
I have attacked De Pauw , [ 1 ] Thornton , [ 1 ] Lord Elgin , [ 2 ] Spain , Portugal , the ` Edinburgh Review ' , [ 3 ] travellers , Painters , Antiquarians , and others , so you see what a dish of Sour Crout Controversy I shall prepare for myself .
It would not answer for me to give way , now  as I was forced into bitterness at the beginning , I will go through to the last .
` Vae Victis ' !
If I fall , I shall fall gloriously , fighting against a host .

MY DEAR SIR,-In a stanza towards the end of canto 1st , there is in the concluding line ,


Some bitter bubbles up , and e ` en on roses stings .


I have altered it as follows :


Full from the heart of joy 's delicious springs Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings .


If you will point out the stanzas on Cintra [ 1 ] which you wish recast , I will send you mine answer .
Be good enough to address your letters here , and they will either be forwarded or saved till my return .
My agent comes tomorrow , and we shall set out immediately .


The press must not proceed of course without my seeing the proofs , as I have much to do .
Pray , do you think any alterations should be made in the stanzas on Vathek ?
[ 2 ]


I should be sorry to make any improper allusion , as I merely wish to adduce an example of wasted wealth , and the reflection which arose in surveying the most desolate mansion in the most beautiful spot I ever beheld .


Pray keep Cawthorn back  he was not to begin till November , and even that will be two months too soon .
I am so sorry my hand is unintelligible  but I can neither deny your accusation , nor remove the cause of it .
-- It is a sad scrawl , certes .
-- A perilous quantity of annotation hath been sent  I think almost enough , with the specimens of Romaic I mean to annex .


I will have nothing to say to your metaphysics , and allegories of rocks and beaches  we shall all go to the bottom together , so `` let us eat and drink , for tomorrow , etc. '' I am as comfortable in my creed as others , inasmuch as it is better to sleep than to be awake .


I have heard nothing of Murray  I hope he is ashamed of himself .
He sent me a vastly complimentary epistle , with a request to alter the two , and finish another canto .
I sent him as civil an answer as if I had been engaged to translate by the sheet , declining altering anything in sentiment , but offered to tag rhymes , and mend them as long as he liked .


I will write from Rochdale when I arrive , if my affairs allow me  but I shall be so busy and savage all the time with the whole set , that my letters will , perhaps , be as pettish as myself .
If so , lay the blame on coal and coal-heavers .
Very probably I may proceed to town by way of Newstead on my return from Lancs .
I mean to be at Cambridge in November , so that , at all events , we shall be nearer .
I will not apologise for the trouble I have given and do give you , though I ought to do so  but I have worn out my politest periods , and can only say that I am much obliged to you .


Believe me , yours always ,


BYRON .

Newstead Abbey , Oct. 10th , 1811 .


DEAR WEBSTER , -- I can hardly invite a gentleman to my house a second time who walked out of it the first in so singular a mood , but if you had thought proper to pay me a visit , you would have had a `` Highland Welcome . ''


I am only just returned to it out of Lancashire , where I have been on business to a Coal manor of mine near Rochdale , and shall leave it very shortly for Cambridge and London .
My companions , or rather companion , ( for Claridge alone has been with me ) have not been very amusing , and , as to their `` Sincerity , '' they are doubtless sincere enough for a man who will never put them to the trial .
Besides you talked so much of your conjugal happiness , that an invitation from home would have seemed like Sacrilege , and my rough Bachelor 's Hall would have appeared to little advantage after the `` Bower of Armida '' [ 1 ] where you have been reposing .


I can not boast of my social powers at any time , and just at present they are more stagnant than ever .
Your Brother-in-law [ 2 ] means to stand for Wexford , but I have reasons for thinking the Portsmouth interest will be against him  however I wish him success .
Do you mean to stand for any place next election ?
What are your politics ?
I hope Valentia 's Lord is for the Catholics .
You will find Hobhouse at Enniscorthy in the contested County .


Pray what has seized you ?
your last letter is the only one in which you do not rave upon matrimony .
Are there no symptoms of a young W.W. ?
and shall I never be a Godfather ?
I believe I must be married myself soon , but it shall be a secret and a Surprise .
However , knowing your exceeding discretion I shall probably entrust the secret to your silence at a proper period .
You have , it is true , invited me repeatedly to Dean 's Court [ 3 ] and now , when it is probable I might adventure there , you wish to be off .
Be it so .


If you address your letters to this place they will be forwarded wherever I sojourn .
I am about to meet some friends at Cambridge and on to town in November .


The papers are full of Dalrymple 's Bigamy [ 4 ] ( I know the man ) .
What the Devil will he do with his Spare-rib ?
He is no beauty , but as lame as myself .
He has more ladies than legs , what comfort to a cripple !

baffled by a vanquished foe , Wheedled by conynge tongues of laurels due , Stand , worthy of each other , in a row Sirs Arthur , Harry , and the dizzard Hew Dalrymple , seely wight , sore dupe of ` tother tew . ''


XXVII .


`` But when Convention sent his handy work , Pens , tongues , feet , hands , combined in wild uproar  Mayor , Alderman , laid down th ' uplifted fork  The bench of Bishops half forgot to snore  Stern Cobbett , who for one whole week forbore To question aught , once more with transport leapt , And bit his dev ` lish quill agen , and swore With foe such treaty never should be kept .
Then burst the blatant beast , and roared and raged and -- slept !!! ''


XXVIII .


`` Thus unto heaven appealed the people  heaven , Which loves the lieges of our gracious King , Decreed that ere our generals were forgiven , Inquiry should be held about the thing .
But mercy cloaked the babes beneath her wing  And as they spared our foes so spared we them .
( Where was the pity of our sires for Byng ? )
Yet knaves , not idiots , should the law condemn .
Then live ye , triumph gallants !
and bless your judges ' phlegm . '' ]

I have returned from Lancashire , and ascertained that my property there may be made very valuable , but various circumstances very much circumscribe my exertions at present .
I shall be in town on business in the beginning of November , and perhaps at Cambridge before the end of this month  but of my movements you shall be regularly apprised .
Your objections I have in part done away by alterations , which I hope will suffice  and I have sent two or three additional stanzas for both `` Fyttes . ''
I have been again shocked with a death , and have lost one very dear to me in happier times [ 1 ]  but `` I have almost forgot the taste of grief , '' and `` supped full of horrors '' [ 2 ] till I have become callous , nor have I a tear left for an event which , five years ago , would have bowed down my head to the earth .
It seems as though I were to experience in my youth the greatest misery of age .
My friends fall around me , and I shall be left a lonely tree before I am withered .
Other men can always take refuge in their families  I have no resource but my own reflections , and they present no prospect here or hereafter , except the selfish satisfaction of surviving my betters .
I am indeed very wretched , and you will excuse my saying so , as you know I am not apt to cant of sensibility .


Instead of tiring yourself with my concerns , I should be glad to hear your plans of retirement .
I suppose you would not like to be wholly shut out of society ?
Now I know a large village , or small town , about twelve miles off , where your family would have the advantage of very genteel society , without the hazard of being annoyed by mercantile affluence  where you would meet with men of information and independence  and where I have friends to whom I should be proud to introduce you .
There are , besides , a coffee-room , assemblies , etc. , etc. , which bring people together .
My mother had a house there some years , and I am well acquainted with the economy of Southwell , the name of this little commonwealth .
Lastly , you will not be very remote from me  and though I am the very worst companion for young people in the world , this objection would not apply to you , whom I could see frequently .
Your expenses , too , would be such as best suit your inclinations , more or less , as you thought proper  but very little would be requisite to enable you to enter into all the gaieties of a country life .
You could be as quiet or bustling as you liked , and certainly as well situated as on the lakes of Cumberland , unless you have a particular wish to be picturesque .


Pray , is your Ionian friend in town ?
You have promised me an introduction .
You mention having consulted some friend on the MSS .
Is not this contrary to our usual way ?
Instruct Mr. Murray not to allow his shopman to call the work Child of Harrow 's Pilgrimage !!!!! [ 3 ] as he has done to some of my astonished friends , who wrote to inquire after my sanity on the occasion , as well they might .
I have heard nothing of Murray , whom I scolded heartily .
Must I write more notes ?
Are there not enough ?
Cawthorn must be kept back with the Hints .
I hope he is getting on with Hobhouse 's quarto .
Good evening .


Yours ever , etc. .

You will begin to deem me a most liberal correspondent  but as my letters are free , you will overlook their frequency .
I have sent you answers in prose and verse to all your late communications  and though I am invading your ease again , I do n't know why , or what to put down that you are not acquainted with already .
I am growing nervous ( how you will laugh ! )
-- but it is true , -- really , wretchedly , ridiculously , fine-ladically nervous .
Your climate kills me  I can neither read , write , nor amuse myself , or any one else .
My days are listless , and my nights restless  I have very seldom any society , and when I have , I run out of it .
At `` this present writing , '' there are in the next room three ladies , and I have stolen away to write this grumbling letter .
-- I do n't know that I sha 'n' t end with insanity , for I find a want of method in arranging my thoughts that perplexes me strangely  but this looks more like silliness than madness , as Scrope Davies would facetiously remark in his consoling manner .
I must try the hartshorn of your company  and a session of Parliament would suit me well , -- any thing to cure me of conjugating the accursed verb `` ennuyer . ''


When shall you be at Cambridge ?
You have hinted , I think , that your friend Bland [ 1 ] is returned from Holland .
I have always had a great respect for his talents , and for all that I have heard of his character  but of me , I believe he knows nothing , except that he heard my sixth form repetitions ten months together at the average of two lines a morning , and those never perfect .
I remembered him and his Slaves as I passed between Capes Matapan , St. Angelo , and his Isle of Ceriga , and I always bewailed the absence of the Anthology .
I suppose he will now translate Vondel , the Dutch Shakspeare , and Gysbert van Amsteli [ 2 ]


will easily be accommodated to our stage in its present state  and I presume he saw the Dutch poem , where the love of Pyramus and Thisbe is compared to the passion of Christ  also the love of Lucifer for Eve , and other varieties of Low Country literature .


No doubt you will think me crazed to talk of such things , but they are all in black and white and good repute on the banks of every canal from Amsterdam to Alkmaar .


Yours ever ,


B .


My poesy is in the hands of its various publishers  but the Hints from Horace ( to which I have subjoined some savage lines on Methodism , [ 3 ] and ferocious notes on the vanity of the triple Editory of the Edin .
Annual Register [ 4 ] ) , my Hints , I say , stand still , and why ?
-- I have not a friend in the world ( but you and Drury ) who can construe Horace 's Latin or my English well enough to adjust them for the press , or to correct the proofs in a grammatical way .
So that , unless you have bowels when you return to town ( I am too far off to do it for myself ) , this ineffable work will be lost to the world for -- I do n't know how many weeks .


Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage must wait till Murray 's is finished .
He is making a tour in Middlesex , and is to return soon , when high matter may be expected .
He wants to have it in quarto , which is a cursed unsaleable size  but it is pestilent long , and one must obey one 's bookseller .
I trust Murray will pass the Paddington Canal without being seduced by Payne and Mackinlay 's example , -- I say Payne and Mackinlay , supposing that the partnership held good .
Drury , the villain , has not written to me  `` I am never ( as Mrs. Lumpkin [ 5 ] says to Tony ) to be gratified with the monster 's dear wild notes . ''


So you are going ( going indeed ! )
into orders .
You must make your peace with the Eclectic Reviewers -- they accuse you of impiety , I fear , with injustice .
Demetrius , the `` Sieger of Cities , '' is here , with `` Gilpin Horner . ''
[ 6 ]


The painter [ 7 ] is not necessary , as the portraits he already painted are ( by anticipation ) very like the new animals .
-- Write , and send me your `` Love Song '' -- but I want paulo majora from you .
Make a dash before you are a deacon , and try a dry publisher .


Yours always ,

In his ` Four Slaves of Cythera ' ( 1809 ) , Canto I. , occur the following lines :


`` Now full in sight the Paphian gardens smile , And thence by many a green and summer isle , Whose ancient walls and temples seem to sleep , Enshadowed on the mirror of the deep , They coast along Cythera 's happy ground , Gem of the sea , for love 's delight renown'd . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : Bland had been acting as English Chaplain in Holland .
Joost Van Vondel ( 1587-1679 ) , born at Cologne of Anabaptist parents , became a Roman Catholic in 1641 .
Most of his thirty-two tragedies are on classical or religious subjects , and in the latter may be traced his gradual change of faith .
` Gysbrecht van Amstel ' ( 1637 ) is a play , the action of which takes place on Christmas Day in the thirteenth century .
The scene is laid at Amsterdam , which is captured by a ruse like that of the Greeks at Troy .
The play appealed strongly to the patriotic instincts of the Dutch by its prophecy of the future greatness of Amsterdam .
Vondel 's ` Lucifer ' ( 1654 ) has been often compared to ` Paradise Lost ' .
It also bears some affinities to ` Cain ' .
In it the Archangel Lucifer rebels against God on learning the Divine intention to take on Himself the nature , not of Angels , but of Man . ]

The prospectus promised a general history of Europe  a collection of State papers  a chronicle of events  original essays on morality , literature , and science  and articles on biography , the useful arts , and meteorology .
The Editor was Scott , and Southey was responsible for the historical department .
The first two parts , giving the history of 1808 , did not appear till July , 1810 , and then with an editorial apology for the omission of the articles on biography , the useful arts , and meteorology  also with an explanation that the idea of original essays on morality , literature , and science had been abandoned .

DEAR SIR , -- Stanza 9th , for Canto 2nd , somewhat altered , to avoid recurrence in a former stanza .


STANZA 9 .


There , thou !
whose love and life together fled , Have left me here to love and live in vain : -- Twined with my heart , and can I deem thee dead , When busy Memory flashes o'er my brain ?
Well -- I will dream that we may meet again , And woo the vision to my vacant breast  If aught of young Remembrance then remain , Be as it may Whate'er beside Futurity 's behest 


or , --


Howe'er may be For me ` twere bliss enough to see thy spirit blest !


I think it proper to state to you , that this stanza alludes to an event which has taken place since my arrival here , and not to the death of any male friend .


Yours ,

I am on the wing for Cambridge .
Thence , after a short stay , to London .
Will you be good enough to keep an account of all the MSS .
you receive , for fear of omission ?
Have you adopted the three altered stanzas of the latest proof ?
I can do nothing more with them .
I am glad you like the new ones .
Of the last , and of the two , I sent for a new edition , to-day a fresh note .
The lines of the second sheet I fear must stand  I will give you reasons when we meet .

[ 1 ]


Cambridge , October 27 , 1811 .


SIR , -- Your letter followed me from Notts , to this place , which will account for the delay of my reply .


Your former letter I never had the honour to receive  -- be assured in whatever part of the world it had found me , I should have deemed it my duty to return and answer it in person .


The advertisement you mention , I know nothing of .
-- At the time of your meeting with Mr. Jeffrey , I had recently entered College , and remember to have heard and read a number of squibs on the occasion  and from the recollection of these I derived all my knowledge on the subject , without the slightest idea of `` giving the lie '' to an address which I never beheld .
When I put my name to the production , which has occasioned this correspondence , I became responsible to all whom it might concern , -- to explain where it requires explanation , and , where insufficiently or too sufficiently explicit , at all events to satisfy .
My situation leaves me no choice  it rests with the injured and the angry to obtain reparation in their own way .


With regard to the passage in question , you were certainly not the person towards whom I felt personally hostile .
On the contrary , my whole thoughts were engrossed by one , whom I had reason to consider as my worst literary enemy , nor could I foresee that his former antagonist was about to become his champion .
You do not specify what you would wish to have done : I can neither retract nor apologise for a charge of falsehood which I never advanced .


In the beginning of the week , I shall be at No. 8 , St. James 's Street .
-- Neither the letter nor the friend to whom you stated your intention ever made their appearance .


Your friend , Mr. Rogers , [ 2 ] or any other gentleman delegated by you , will find me most ready to adopt any conciliatory proposition which shall not compromise my own honour , -- or , failing in that , to make the atonement you deem it necessary to require .


I have the honour to be , Sir ,


Your most obedient , humble servant ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Thomas Moore ( 1779-1852 ) , by his literary and social gifts , had made his name several years before 1811 , when he first became personally acquainted with Byron .
His precocity was as remarkable as his versatility .
The son of a Dublin grocer , for whom his political interest secured the post of barrack-master , he went , like Sheridan , to Samuel Whyte 's school , and was afterwards at Trinity College , Dublin .
Before he was fifteen he had written verses , including lines to Whyte , himself a poet , the publication of which , in the ` Anthologia Hibernica ' ( October , 1793  February , March , and June , 1794 ) , gained him a local reputation .
Coming to London in 1799 , he read law at the Middle Temple .
His ` Odes ' translated from Anacreon ( 1800 ) , dedicated to the Prince of Wales , opened to him the houses of the Whig aristocracy  and his powers as a singer , an actor , a talker , and , later , as a satirist , made him a favourite in society .
In 1801 appeared his ` Poems : by the late Thomas Little ' , amatory verses which Byron read , and imitated in some of the silliest of his youthful lines .


The review of Moore 's ` Odes , Epistles , and Other Poems ' ( 1806 ) , which appeared in the ` Edinburgh Review ' for July , 1806 , provoked Moore to challenge Jeffrey .
Their duel with `` leadless pistols '' led , not only to Moore 's friendship with Jeffrey , but , indirectly , as is seen from the following letters , to Moore 's acquaintance with Byron .
Moore himself contributed to the ` Edinburgh ' , between the years 1814 and 1834 , essays on multifarious subjects , from poetry to German Rationalism , from the Fathers to French official life .
In 1807 the first of the ` Irish Melodies ' was published  they continued to appear at irregular intervals till 1834 , when 122 had been printed .
A master of the art of versification , Moore sings , with graceful fancy , in a tone of mingled mirth and melancholy , his love of his country , of the wine of other countries , and the women of all countries .
But , except in his patriotism , he shows little depth of feeling .
The ` Melodies ' are the work of a brilliantly clever man , endowed with an exquisite musical ear , and a temperament that is rather susceptible than intense .
With them may be classed his ` National Airs ' ( 1815 ) and ` Sacred Song ' ( 1816 ) .


Moore had already found one field in which he excelled  it was not long before he discovered another .
His serious satires , ` Corruption ' ( 1808 ) , ` Intolerance ' ( 1808 ) , and ` The Sceptic ' ( 1809 ) , failed .
His nature was neither deep enough nor strong enough for success in such themes .
In the ephemeral strife of party politics he found his real province .
Nothing can be better of their kind than the metrical lampoons collected in ` Intercepted Letters , or the Twopenny Post-bag , by Thomas Brown the Younger ' ( 1813 ) .
In his hands the bow and arrows of Cupid become formidable weapons of party warfare  nor do their ornaments impede the movements of the archer .
The shaft is gaily winged and brightly polished  the barb sharp and dipped in venom  and the missile hums music as it flies to its mark .
Moore 's satire is the satire of the Clubs at its best  but it is scarcely the satire of literature .
` The Twopenny Post-bag ' was the parent of many similar productions , beginning with ` The Fudge Family in Paris ' ( 1818 ) , and ending with ` Fables for the Holy Alliance ' ( 1823 ) , which he dedicated to Byron .


As a serious poet , and the author of ` Lalla Rookh ' ( 1817 ) , ` The Loves of the Angels ' ( 1823 ) , and ` Alciphron ' ( 1839 ) , Moore was perhaps overrated by his contemporaries .
In spite of their brightness of fancy , metrical skill , and brilliant cleverness , they lack the greater elements of the highest poetry .


Moore 's prose work begins , apart from his contributions to periodical literature , with the ` Memoirs of Captain Rock ' ( 1824 ) , ` The Epicurean ' ( 1827 ) , ` The Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion ' ( 1834 ) , ` The History of Ireland ' ( 1846 )  and a succession of biographies -- the life of ` Sheridan ' ( 1825 ) , of ` Byron ' ( 1830 ) , and ` Lord Edward Fitzgerald ' ( 1831 ) -- complete the list .
In the midst of his biographical work , Moore was advised by Lord Lansdowne to write nine lives at once , and print them together under the title of ` The Cat ' .


In 1811 Moore married Miss Elizabeth Dyke ( born 1793 ) , an actress who fascinated him at the Kilkenny private theatricals in 1809 .
To the outer world , Mrs. Moore 's bird , as she called him , was a sprightly little songster , who lived in a whirl of dinners , suppers , concerts , and theatricals .
These , as well as his private anxieties and misfortunes , are recorded in the eight volumes of his ` Memoirs , Journals , and Correspondence ' , which were edited by Lord John Russell , in 1853 .
Moore was an excellent son , a good husband , an affectionate father , and to Byron a loyal friend , neither envious nor subservient .
Clare , Hobhouse , and Moore were ( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations ' , 2nd edition , 1850 , pp. 393 , 394 ) the only persons whose friendship Byron never disclaimed .
He spoke of Moore ( ` ibid ' .
, pp. 322 , 323 ) as `` a delightful companion , gay without being boisterous , witty without effort , comic without coarseness , and sentimental without being lachrymose .
He reminds one of the fairy who , whenever she spoke , let diamonds fall from her lips .
My ` tete-a-tete ' suppers with Moore are among the most agreeable impressions I retain of the hours passed in London . ''


In July , 1806 , in consequence of the article in the ` Edinburgh Review ' on his recent volume of ` Poems ' , Moore sent , through his friend Hume , a challenge to Jeffrey , who was seconded by Francis Horner , and a meeting was arranged .
Moore , who had only once in his life discharged a firearm of any kind , and then nearly blew his thumb off , borrowed a case of pistols from William Spencer , and bought in Bond Street enough powder and bullets for a score of duels .
The parties met at Chalk Farm  the seconds loaded the pistols , placed the men at their posts , and were about to give the signal to fire , when the police officers , rushing upon them from behind a hedge , knocked Jeffrey 's weapon from his hand , disarmed Moore , and conveyed the whole party to Bow Street .
They were released on bail  but , on Moore returning to claim the borrowed pistols , the officer refused to give them up , because only Moore 's pistol was loaded with ball .
Horner , however , gave evidence that he had seen both pistols loaded  and there , but for the reports circulated in the newspapers , the affair would have ended .
But the joke was too good to be allowed to drop , and , in spite of Moore 's published letter , he was for months a target for the wits ( ` Memoirs , Journals , and Correspondence ' , vol .
i. pp. 199-208 ) .


In ` English Bards , etc. ' , lines 466 , 467 , and his ` note ' , Byron made merry over `` Little 's leadless pistol , '' with the result that , when the second edition oL the satire was published , with his name attached , Moore sent him the following letter : --


`` Dublin , January 1 , 1810 .


`` My Lord , -- Having just seen the name of ` Lord Byron ' prefixed to a work entitled ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ' , in which , as it appears to me , ` the lie is given ' to a public statement of mine , respecting an affair with Mr. Jeffrey some years since , I beg you will have the goodness to inform me whether I may consider your Lordship as the author of this publication .


`` I shall not , I fear , be able to return to London for a week or two  but , in the mean time , I trust your Lordship will not deny me the satisfaction of knowing whether you avow the insult contained in the passages alluded to .


`` It is needless to suggest to your Lordship the propriety of keeping our correspondence secret .


`` I have the honour to be ,


`` Your Lordship 's very humble servant ,


`` THOMAS MOORE .


`` 22 , Molesworth Street . ''


Owing to Byron 's absence abroad , the letter never reached him  it was , in fact , kept back by Hodgson .
On his return to England , Moore , who in the interval had married , sent him a second letter , restating the nature of the insult he had received in ` English Bards ' .


'' ` It is now useless , ' I continued ( ` Life ' , p. 143 ) , ` to speak of the steps with which it was my intention to follow up that letter .
The time which has elapsed since then , though it has done away neither the injury nor the feeling of it , has , in many respects , materially altered my situation  and the only object which I have now in writing to your Lordship is to preserve some consistency with that former letter , and to prove to you that the injured feeling still exists , however circumstances may compel me to be deaf to its dictates , at present .
When I say `` injured feeling , '' let me assure your Lordship that there is not a single vindictive sentiment in my mind towards you .
I mean but to express that uneasiness , under ( what I consider to be ) a charge of falsehood , which must haunt a man of any feeling to his grave , unless the insult be retracted or atoned for  and which , if I did ` not ' feel , I should , indeed , deserve far worse than your Lordship 's satire could inflict upon me . '
In conclusion I added , that so far from being influenced by any angry or resentful feeling towards him , it would give me sincere pleasure if , by any satisfactory explanation , he would enable me to seek the honour of being henceforward ranked among his acquaintance . ''


Byron 's letter of October 27 , 1811 .

DEAR SIR , -- I arrived in town last night , and shall be very glad to see you when convenient .


Yours very truly ,


BYRON .

-- To Thomas Moore .
[ 1 ]


8 , St. James 's Street , October 29 , 1811 .


SIR , -- Soon after my return to England , my friend , Mr. Hodgson , apprised me that a letter for me was in his possession  but a domestic event hurrying me from London immediately after , the letter ( which may most probably be your own ) is still unopened in his keeping .
If , on examination of the address , the similarity of the handwriting should lead to such a conclusion , it shall be opened in your presence , for the satisfaction of all parties .
Mr. H. is at present out of town  -- on Friday I shall see him , and request him to forward it to my address .


With regard to the latter part of both your letters , until the principal point was discussed between us , I felt myself at a loss in what manner to reply .
Was I to anticipate friendship from one , who conceived me to have charged him with falsehood ?
Were not advances , under such circumstances , to be misconstrued , -- not , perhaps , by the person to whom they were addressed , but by others ?
In my case such a step was impracticable .
If you , who conceived yourself to be the offended person , are satisfied that you had no cause for offence , it will not be difficult to convince me of it .
My situation , as I have before stated , leaves me no choice .
I should have felt proud of your acquaintance , had it commenced under other circumstances  but it must rest with you to determine how far it may proceed after so auspicious a beginning .


I have the honour to be , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : Moore had replied , accepting Byron 's explanation , and adding ,


`` As your Lordship does not show any wish to proceed beyond the rigid formulary of explanation , it is not for me to make any further advances .
We Irishmen , in businesses of this kind , seldom know any medium between decided hostility and decided friendship  but , as any approaches towards the latter alternative must now depend entirely on your Lordship , I have only to repeat that I am satisfied with your letter , and that I have the honour to be , '' etc. , etc. ]

SIR , -- You must excuse my troubling you once more upon this very unpleasant subject .
It would be a satisfaction to me , and I should think to yourself , that the unopened letter in Mr. Hodgson 's possession ( supposing it to prove your own ) should be returned in statu quo to the writer  particularly as you expressed yourself `` not quite easy under the manner in which I had dwelt on its miscarriage . ''


A few words more , and I shall not trouble you further .
I felt , and still feel , very much flattered by those parts of your correspondence , which held out the prospect of our becoming acquainted .
If I did not meet them in the first instance as perhaps I ought , let the situation I was placed in be my defence .
You have now declared yourself satisfied , and on that point we are no longer at issue .
If , therefore , you still retain any wish to do me the honour you hinted at , I shall be most happy to meet you , when , where , and how you please , and I presume you will not attribute my saying thus much to any unworthy motive .


I have the honour to remain , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 :


`` Piqued , '' says Moore ( ` Life ' , 144 ) , `` at the manner in which my efforts towards a more friendly understanding were received , ''


he had briefly expressed his satisfaction at Byron 's explanation , and added that the correspondence might close . ]

8 , St. James 's Street , October 31 , 1811 .


DEAR SIR , -- I have already taken up so much of your time that there needs no excuse on your part , but a great many on mine , for the present interruption .
I have altered the passages according to your wish .
With this note I send a few stanzas on a subject which has lately occupied much of my thoughts .
They refer to the death of one to whose name you are a stranger , and , consequently , can not be interested .
I mean them to complete the present volume .
They relate to the same person whom I have mentioned in Canto 2nd , and at the conclusion of the poem .


I by no means intend to identify myself with ` Harold ' , but to deny all connection with him .
If in parts I may be thought to have drawn from myself , believe me it is but in parts , and I shall not own even to that .
As to the Monastic dome , etc. , [ 1 ] I thought those circumstances would suit him as well as any other , and I could describe what I had seen better than I could invent .
I would not be such a fellow as I have made my hero for all the world .


Yours ever ,

8 , St. James 's Street , November 1 , 1811 .


Sir , -- As I should be very sorry to interrupt your Sunday 's engagement , if Monday , or any other day of the ensuing week , would be equally convenient to yourself and friend , I will then have the honour of accepting his invitation .
[ 1 ]


Of the professions of esteem with which Mr. Rogers [ 2 ] has honoured me , I can not but feel proud , though undeserving .
I should be wanting to myself , if insensible to the praise of such a man  and , should my approaching interview with him and his friend lead to any degree of intimacy with both or either , I shall regard our past correspondence as one of the happiest events of my life .
I have the honour to be ,


Your very sincere and obedient servant ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Rogers has left an account of this dinner .


`` Neither Moore nor myself had ever seen Byron when it was settled that he should dine at my house to meet Moore  nor was he known by sight to Campbell , who , happening to call upon me that morning , consented to join the party .
I thought it best that I alone should be in the drawing-room when Byron entered it  and Moore and Campbell accordingly withdrew .
Soon after his arrival , they returned  and I introduced them to him severally , naming them as Adam named the beasts .
When we sat down to dinner , I asked Byron if he would take soup ?
` No  he never took soup . '
` Would he take some fish ? '
` No  he never took fish . '
Presently I asked if he would eat some mutton ?
` No  he never ate mutton . '
I then asked if he would take a glass of wine ?
` No  he never tasted wine . '
It was now necessary to inquire what he ` did ' eat and drink  and the answer was , ` Nothing but hard biscuits and soda-water . '
Unfortunately , neither hard biscuits nor soda-water were at hand  and he dined upon potatoes bruised down on his plate and drenched with vinegar .
My guests stayed very late , discussing the merits of Walter Scott and Joanna Baillie .
Some days after , meeting Hobhouse , I said to him , ` How long will Lord Byron persevere in his present diet ?
` He replied , ` Just as long as you continue to notice it . '
I did not then know , what I now know to be a fact , that Byron , after leaving my house , had gone to a Club in St. James 's Street and eaten a hearty meat-supper ''


( ` Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers ' , pp. 231 , 232 ) .
Moore 's ( ` Life ' , p. 145 ) first impressions of Byron were


`` the nobleness of his air , his beauty , the gentleness of his voice and manners , and -- what was naturally not the least attraction -- his marked kindness to myself .
Being in mourning for his mother , the colour , as well of his dress , as of his glossy , curling , and picturesque hair , gave more effect to the pure , spiritual paleness of his features , in the expression of which , when he spoke , there was a perpetual play of lively thought , though melancholy was their habitual character when in repose . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : Samuel Rogers ( 1763-1855 ) , the third son of a London banker , was born at Stoke Newington .
Shortly after his father 's death , in 1793 , he withdrew from any active part in the management of the bank , and devoted himself for the rest of his long life to literature , art , and society .
In 1803 he moved from chambers in the Temple to a house in St. James 's Place , overlooking the Green Park .
Here he lived till his death , in December , 1855 , and here he gathered round him , at his celebrated breakfasts , the most distinguished men and women of his time .
An excellent account of the `` Town Mouse '' entertaining the `` Country Mouse '' is given by Dean Stanley ( ` Life ' , vol .
i. p. 298 ) , who met Wordsworth at breakfast with Rogers , in 1841 , and describes


`` the town mouse a sleek , well-fed , sly , ` white ' mouse , and the country mouse with its rough , weather-worn face and grey hairs  the town mouse displaying its delicate little rolls and pyramids of glistening strawberries , the country mouse exulting in its hollow tree , its crust of bread and liberty , and rallying its brother on his late hours and frequent dinners . ''


One of his earliest recollections was the sight of a rebel 's head upon a pole at Temple Bar .
He had talked with a Thames boatman who remembered Pope  had seen Garrick in ` The Suspicious Husband '  had heard Sir Joshua Reynolds deliver his last lecture as President of the Royal Academy  had seen John Wesley `` lying in state '' in the City Road  had gone to call on Dr. Johnson , but , when his hand was on the knocker , found his courage fled .
He lived to be offered the laureateship in 1850 , on the death of Wordsworth , and to decline it in favour of Tennyson .


`` Time was , '' wrote Mathias ( ` Pursuits of Literature ' , note , p. 360 , ed .
1808 ) , `` when bankers were as stupid as their guineas could make them  they were neither orators , nor painters , nor poets .
But now . . .
Mr. Rogers dreams on Parnassus  and , if I am rightly informed , there is a great demand among his brethren for the ` Pleasures of Memory ' . ''


Rogers began to write poetry at an early age , and continued to write it all his life .
His ` Ode to Superstition ' was published in 1786  the ` Pleasures of Memory ' , in 1792  the ` Epistle to a Friend ' , in 1798  ` Columbus ' , in 1812  ` Jacqueline ' , in 1813  ` Human Life ' , in 1819  ` Italy ' , in 1822-34 .
His later years were occupied in revising , correcting , or amplifying his published poems , and in preparing the notes to ` Italy ' , which are admirable studies in compactness and precision of language .
A disciple of Pope , an imitator of Goldsmith , Rogers was rather a skilful adapter than an original poet .
His chief talent was his taste  if he could not originate , he could appreciate .
The fastidious care which he lavished on his work has preserved it .
In his commonplace-book he has entered the number of years which he spent in composing and revising his poems .
His ` Pleasures of Memory ' occupied seven years , ` Columbus ' fourteen , and ` Italy ' fifteen .
An excellent judge of art , he employed Flaxman , Stothard , and Turner at a time when their powers were little appreciated by his fellow-countrymen .
Of his taste Byron speaks enthusiastically in his Journal ( see p. 331 ) .
But the following passage ( hitherto unpublished ) from his ` Detached Thoughts ' ( Ravenna , 1821 ) gives his later opinion of the man :


`` When Sheridan was on his death-bed , Rogers aided him with purse and person .
This was particularly kind of Rogers , who always spoke ill of Sheridan ( to me , at least ) , but , indeed , he does that of everybody to anybody .
Rogers is the reverse of the line :


` The best good man with the worst natured Muse , '


being :


` The worst good man with the best natured Muse . '


His Muse being all Sentiment and Sago and Sugar , while he himself is a venomous talker .
I say ` worst good man ' because he is ( perhaps ) a ` good ' man  at least he does good now and then , as well he may , to purchase himself a shilling 's worth of salvation for his slanders .
They are so ` little ' , too -- small talk -- and old Womanny , and he is malignant too -- and envious -- and -- he be damned ! ''


In a manuscript note to these passages Sir Walter Scott writes ,


`` I never heard Rogers say a single word against Byron , which is rather odd too .
Byron wrote a bitter and undeserved satire on Rogers .
This conduct must have been motived by something or other . ''


Speaking of Rogers and Sheridan , he says ,


`` He certainly took pennyworths out of his friend 's character .
I sat three hours for my picture to Sir Thomas Lawrence , during which the whole conversation was filled up by Rogers with stories of Sheridan , for the least of which , if true , he deserved the gallows .
One respected his committing a rape on his sister-in-law on the day of her husband 's funeral .
Others were worse . ''


In politics Rogers was a Whig , in religion a Presbyterian .
But he meddled little with either .
In private life he was as kindly in action as he was caustic in speech .
A sensitive man himself , he studied to be satirical to others .
When Ward condemned ` Columbus ' in the ` Quarterly Review ' , Rogers repaid his critic in the stinging epigram :


`` Ward has no heart , they say  but I deny it  He has a heart , and gets his speeches by it . ''


Byron warmly admired Rogers 's poetry .
To him he dedicated ` The Giaour ' , in


`` admiration for his genius , respect for his character , and gratitude for his friendship . ''


The ` Quarterly Review ' , in an article on ` The Corsair ' and ` Lara ' , mentions


`` the highly refined , but somewhat insipid , pastoral tale of ` Jacqueline ' . ''


Byron , on reading the review , said to Lady Byron ,


`` The man 's a fool .
` Jacqueline ' is as superior to ` Lara ' as Rogers is to me ''


( ` Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers ' , p. 154 , ` note ' ) .


`` The ` Pleasures of Memory ' , '' he said ( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations ' , p. 153 ) , `` is a very beautiful poem , harmonious , finished , and chaste  it contains not a single meretricious ornament .
If Rogers has not fixed himself in the higher fields of Parnassus , he has , at least , cultivated a very pretty flower-garden at its base . ''
But he goes on to speak of the poem ( p. 354 ) as `` a ` hortus siccus ' of pretty flowers , '' and an illustration of `` the difference between inspiration and versification . ''


If Rogers ever saw Byron 's ` Question and Answer ' ( 1818 ) , he was generous enough to forget the satire .
In ` Italy ' he paid a noble tribute to the genius of the dead poet :


`` He is now at rest  And praise and blame fall on his ear alike , Now dull in death .
Yes , Byron , thou art gone , Gone like a star that through the firmament Shot and was lost , in its eccentric course Dazzling , perplexing .
Yet thy heart , methinks , Was generous , noble -- noble in its scorn Of all things low or little  nothing there Sordid or servile .
If imagined wrongs Pursued thee , urging thee sometimes to do Things long regretted , oft , as many know , None more than I , thy gratitude would build On slight foundations  and , if in thy life Not happy , in thy death thou surely wert , Thy wish accomplished  dying in the land Where thy young mind had caught ethereal fire , Dying in Greece , and in a cause so glorious !
They in thy train -- ah , little did they think , As round we went , that they so soon should sit Mourning beside thee , while a Nation mourned , Changing her festal for her funeral song  That they so soon should hear the minute-gun , As morning gleamed on what remained of thee , Roll o'er the sea , the mountains , numbering Thy years of joy and sorrow .
Thou art gone  And he who would assail thee in thy grave , Oh , let him pause !
For who among us all , Tried as thou wert -- even from thy earliest years , When wandering , yet unspoilt , a Highland boy -- Tried as thou wert , and with thy soul of flame  Pleasure , while yet the down was on thy cheek , Uplifting , pressing , and to lips like thine , Her charmed cup -- ah , who among us all Could say he had not erred as much , and more ? '' ]

Dear Hodgson , -- I have been waiting for the letter [ 1 ] which was to have been sent by you immediately , and must again jog your memory on the subject .
I believe I wrote you a full and true account of poor -- 's proceedings .
Since his reunion to -- , [ 2 ] I have heard nothing further from him .
What a pity !
a man of talent , past the heyday of life , and a clergyman , to fall into such imbecility .
I have heard from Hobhouse , who has at last sent more copy to Cawthorn for his Travels .
I franked an enormous cover for you yesterday , seemingly to convey at least twelve cantos on any given subject .
I fear the I aspect of it was too epic for the post .
From this and other coincidences I augur a publication on your part , but what , or when , or how much , you must disclose immediately .


I do n't know what to say about coming down to Cambridge at present , but live in hopes .
I am so completely superannuated there , and besides feel it something brazen in me to wear my magisterial habit , after all my buffooneries , that I hardly think I shall venture again .
And being now an [ Greek : ariston men hydor ] disciple I wo n't come within wine-shot of such determined topers as your collegiates .
I have not yet subscribed to Bowen .
I mean to cut Harrow `` enim unquam '' as somebody classically said for a farewell sentence .
I am superannuated there too , and , in short , as old at twenty-three as many men at seventy .


Do write and send this letter that hath been so long in your custody .
It is important that Moore should be certain that I never received it , if it be his .
Are you drowned in a bottle of Port ?
or a Kilderkin of Ale ?
that I have never heard from you , or are you fallen into a fit of perplexity ?
Cawthorn has declined , and the MS. is returned to him .
This is all at present from yours in the faith ,

Yesterday I wrote to Harness , who will probably tell you what I said on the subject .
Hobhouse has sent me my Romaic MS. , and I shall require your aid in correcting the press , as your Greek eye is more correct than mine .
But these will not come to type this month , I dare say .
I have put some soft lines on ye Scotch in the ` Curse of Minerva '  take them 


`` Yet Caledonia claims some native worth , '' etc. [ 3 ]


If you are not content now , I must say with the Irish drummer to the deserter who called out ,


`` Flog high , flog low ''


`` The de'il burn ye , there 's no pleasing you , flog where one will . ''


Have you given up wine , even British wine ?


I have read Watson to Gibbon .
[ 4 ] He proves nothing , so I am where I was , verging towards Spinoza  and yet it is a gloomy Creed , and I want a better , but there is something Pagan in me that I can not shake off .
In short , I deny nothing , but doubt everything .
The post brings me to a conclusion .
Bland has just been here .

In a letter to Holroyd ( November 4 , 1776 ) , he speaks of the ` Apology ' as `` feeble , '' but `` uncommingly genteel . ''

-- To William Harness .
[ 1 ]


8 , St. James 's Street , Dec. 6 , 1811 .


My Dear Harness , -- I write again , but do n't suppose I mean to lay such a tax on your pen and patience as to expect regular replies .
When you are inclined , write : when silent , I shall have the consolation of knowing that you are much better employed .
Yesterday , Bland and I called on Mr. Miller , who , being then out , will call on Bland to-day or to-morrow .
I shall certainly endeavour to bring them together .
-- You are censorious , child  when you are a little older , you will learn to dislike every body , but abuse nobody .


With regard to the person of whom you speak , your own good sense must direct you .
I never pretend to advise , being an implicit believer in the old proverb .
This present frost is detestable .
It is the first I have felt for these three years , though I longed for one in the oriental summer , when no such thing is to be had , unless I had gone to the top of Hymettus for it .


I thank you most truly for the concluding part of your letter .
I have been of late not much accustomed to kindness from any quarter , and am not the less pleased to meet with it again from one where I had known it earliest .
I have not changed in all my ramblings , -- Harrow , and , of course , yourself , never left me , and the


`` Dulces reminiscitur Argos ''


attended me to the very spot to which that sentence alludes in the mind of the fallen Argive .
-- Our intimacy began before we began to date at all , and it rests with you to continue it till the hour which must number it and me with the things that were .


Do read mathematics .
-- I should think X plus Y at least as amusing as the ` Curse of Kehama ' [ 2 ] , and much more intelligible .
Master Southey 's poems are , in fact , what parallel lines might be -- viz .
prolonged ad infinitum without meeting anything half so absurd as themselves .


`` What news , what news ?
Queen Orraca , What news of scribblers five ?
S -- , W -- , C -- , L -- d , and L -- e ?
All damn'd , though yet alive . ''


Coleridge is lecturing .
[ 3 ]


`` Many an old fool , '' said Hannibal to some such lecturer , `` but such as this , never . ''
[ 4 ]


Ever yours , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : See ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 177 , ` note ' 1 .
[ Footnote 1 of Letter 92 ] ]


[ Footnote 2 : Robert Southey ( 1774-1843 ) published his ` Curse of Kehama ' in 1810 .
It formed a part of a series of heroic poems in which he intended to embody the chief mythologies of the world .
In spite of Byron 's adverse opinion , it contains magnificent passages , and disputes with ` Roderick , the Last of the Goths ' ( 1814 ) , the claim to be the finest of his longer poems .
Southey 's literary activity was immense .
He had already produced ` Joan of Arc ' ( 1796 ) , ` Thalaba ' ( 1801 ) , ` Madoc ' ( 1805 ) , and many other works in prose and verse .
At this time he was personally unknown to Byron , who had ridiculed his `` annual strains . ''
They met for the first time at Holland House , in September , 1813 .
( See Byron 's letter to Moore , September 27 , 1813 , and Journal , p. 331 . )
The animosity between the two men belongs to a later date , and in its origin was partly political , partly personal .
Southey , in early life , had been a republican and a Unitarian , if not a deist .
He collaborated with Coleridge in the ` Fall of Robespierre ' ( 1794 ) , wrote a portion of the ` Conciones ad Populum ' ( 1795 ) , which the Government considered seditious  and , according to Poole ( ` Thomas Pools and his Friends ' , vol .
i. chap , vi . )
, wavered `` between Deism and Atheism . ''
He became a champion of monarchical principles and of religious orthodoxy , and attacked the views , which he had once held and expressed in ` Wat Tyler ' ( written in 1794 , and piratically published in 1817 ) , with the bitterness of a reactionary .
He had also , as Byron believed , circulated , if not invented , a report that Byron and Shelley had formed `` a league of incest '' at Geneva , in 1816-17 , with `` two girls , '' Mary Godwin ( Mrs. Shelley ) and Jane Clairmont .
Byron not only denied the charge , but retorted upon him , in his `` Observations upon an Article in ` Blackwood 's Magazine ' '' ( March 15 , 1820 ) , as the author of ` Wat Tyler ' and poet laureate , the man who `` wrote treason and serves the King , '' the ex-pantisocrat who advocated `` all things , including women , in common . ''
Southey 's ` Vision of Judgment ' , an apotheosis of George III. , published in 1821 , gave Byron a second provocation and a second opportunity , by speaking in the preface of his `` Satanic spirit of pride and audacious impiety . ''
Byron again replied in prose  and Southey ( January 5 , 1820 ) , in a letter to the ` London Courier ' , invited him to attack him in rhyme .
In Byron 's ` Vision of Judgment ' he found his invitation accepted , and himself pilloried in that tremendous satire .
Southey overvalued his own narrative poetry .
It is as a man , a prominent figure in literary history , a leader in the romantic revival , a master of prose , and the author of the best short biography in the English language -- the ` Life of Nelson ' ( 1813 ) -- that he lives at the present day .
His name also deserves to be remembered with gratitude by all who have read the nursery classic of '' ` The Three Bears ' . ''
Byron parodies a stanza in Southey 's `` Queen Orraca and the Five Martyrs of Morocco '' ( ` Works ' , vol .
vi .
pp. 166-173 ) :


`` What news , O King Affonso , What news of the Friars five ?
Have they preached to the Miramamolin  And are they still alive ? ''


The blanks stand for Scott or Southey , Wordsworth , Coleridge , Lloyd , and Lamb ( e ) , with the lines from ` New Morality ' in his mind :


`` Coleridge and Southey , Lloyd and Lamb and Co. , Tune all your mystic harps to praise Lepaux . '' ]


[ Footnote 3 : Coleridge , beginning November 18 , 1811 , and ending January 27 , 1812 , delivered a course of seventeen lectures on Shakespeare and Milton , `` in illustration of the principles of poetry . ''
The lectures were given under the auspices of the London Philosophical Society , in the Scot 's Corporation Hall , Crane Court , Fleet Street .
Single tickets for the whole course were two guineas , or three guineas `` with the privilege of introducing a lady . ''
J. Payne Collier took shorthand notes of the lectures and published a portion of his material , the rest being lost ( ` Lectures on Shakespear ' , from notes by J.P. Collier ) , The notes , with other contemporary reports from the ` Times ' , ` Morning Chronicle ' , ` Dublin Chronicle ' , Crabb Robinson 's ` Diary ' , and other sources , were republished in 1883 by Mr. Ashe ( ` Lectures and Notes on Shakspere and other English Poets ' ) .


Collier , in his notes of Coleridge 's conversation ( November I , 1811 ) , gives the substance , in all probability , of the attack on Campbell alluded to in the next letter .
Coleridge said that `` neither Southey , Scott , nor Campbell would by their poetry survive much beyond the day when they lived and wrote .
Their works seemed to him not to have the seeds of vitality , the real germs of long life .
The two first were entertaining as tellers of stories in verse  but the last , in his ` Pleasures of Hope ' , obviously had no fixed design , but when a thought ( of course , not a very original one ) came into his head , he put it down in couplets , and afterwards strung the ` disjecta membra ' ( not ` poetae ' ) together .
Some of the best things in it were borrowed  for instance the line :


` And freedom shriek'd when Kosciusko fell , '


was taken from a much-ridiculed piece by Dennis , a pindaric on William III. :


` Fair Liberty shriek'd out aloud , aloud Religion groaned . '


It is the same production in which the following much-laughed-at specimen of bathos is found :


` Nor Alps nor Pyreneans keep him out , Nor fortified redoubt . '


Coleridge had little toleration for Campbell , and considered him , as far as he had gone , a mere verse-maker . ''
( Ashe 's Introduction to ` Lectures on Shakspere ' , pp. 16 , 17 ) . ]


[ Footnote 4 : Hannibal , in exile at Ephesus , was taken to hear a lecture by a peripatetic philosopher named Phormio .
The lecturer ( ` homo copiosus ' ) discoursed for some hours on the duties of a general , and military subjects generally .
The delighted audience asked Hannibal his opinion of the lecture .
He replied in Greek ,


`` I have seen many old fools often , but such an old fool as Phormio , never


( ` Multos se deliros senes s3/4pe vidisse  sed qui magis , quam Phormio , deliraret , vidisse neminem ' ) ''

I hope you are going on to your satisfaction , and that her Ladyship is about to produce an heir with all his mother 's Graces and all his Sire 's good qualities .
You know I am to be a Godfather .
Byron Webster !

No , Bachelors for me !
I consider you as dead to us , and all my future devoirs are but tributes of respect to your Memory .

he was a facetious companion and well respected by all who knew him  but he is gone .
Sooner or later we must all come to it .


I see nothing of you in the papers , the only place where I do n't wish to see you  but you will be in town in the Winter .
What dost thou do ?
shoot , hunt , and `` wind up y' e Clock '' as Caleb Quotem says ?
[ 1 ]


That thou art vastly happy , I doubt not .


I see your brother in law at times , and like him much  but we miss you much  I shall leave town in a fortnight to pass my Xmas in Notts .

St. James 's Street , Dec. 8 , 1811 .


Behold a most formidable sheet , without gilt or black edging , and consequently very vulgar and indecorous , particularly to one of your precision  but this being Sunday , I can procure no better , and will atone for its length by not filling it .
Bland I have not seen since my last letter  but on Tuesday he dines with me , and will meet Moore , the epitome of all that is exquisite in poetical or personal accomplishments .
How Bland has settled with Miller , I know not .
I have very little interest with either , and they must arrange their concerns according to their own gusto .
I have done my endeavours , at your request , to bring them together , and hope they may agree to their mutual advantage .


Coleridge has been lecturing against Campbell .
[ 1 ]


Rogers was present , and from him I derive the information .
We are going to make a party to hear this Manichean of poesy .
Pole [ 2 ] is to marry Miss Long , and will be a very miserable dog for all that .
The present ministers are to continue , and his Majesty does continue in the same state  so there 's folly and madness for you , both in a breath .


I never heard but of one man truly fortunate , and he was Beaumarchais , [ 3 ] the author of Figaro , who buried two wives and gained three lawsuits before he was thirty .


And now , child , what art thou doing ?
Reading , I trust .
I want to see you take a degree .
Remember , this is the most important period of your life  and do n't disappoint your papa and your aunt , and all your kin -- besides myself .
Do n't you know that all male children are begotten for the express purpose of being graduates ?
and that even I am an A.M. , [ 4 ] though how I became so the Public Orator only can resolve .
Besides , you are to be a priest  and to confute Sir William Drummond 's late book about the Bible [ 5 ] ( printed , but not published ) , and all other infidels whatever .
Now leave Master H. 's gig , and Master S. 's Sapphics , and become as immortal as Cambridge can make you .


You see , Mio Carissimo , what a pestilent correspondent I am likely to become  but then you shall be as quiet at Newstead as you please , and I wo n't disturb your studies as I do now .
When do you fix the day , that I may take you up according to contract ?
Hodgson talks of making a third in our journey  but we ca n't stow him , inside at least .
Positively you shall go with me as was agreed , and do n't let me have any of your politesse to H. on the occasion .
I shall manage to arrange for both with a little contrivance .
I wish H. was not quite so fat , and we should pack better .
You will want to know what I am doing -- chewing tobacco .


You see nothing of my allies , Scrope Davies and Matthews [ 6 ] -- they do n't suit you  and how does it happen that I -- who am a pipkin of the same pottery -- continue in your good graces ?
Good night , -- I will go on in the morning .


Dec. 9th .
-- In a morning I am always sullen , and to-day is as sombre as myself .
Rain and mist are worse than a sirocco , particularly in a beef-eating and beer-drinking country .
My bookseller , Cawthorne , has just left me , and tells me , with a most important face , that he is in treaty for a novel of Madame D'Arblay 's , for which 1000 guineas are asked !
[ 7 ] He wants me to read the MS. ( if he obtains it ) , which I shall do with pleasure  but I should be very cautious in venturing an opinion on her whose Cecilia Dr. Johnson superintended .
[ 8 ]


If he lends it to me , I shall put it in the hands of Rogers and Moore , who are truly men of taste .
I have filled the sheet , and beg your pardon  I will not do it again .
I shall , perhaps , write again  but if not , believe , silent or scribbling , that I am ,


My dearest William , ever , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : See p. 75 , ` note ' 1 .
In the application to Coleridge of the phrase , `` Manichean of poesy , '' Byron may allude to Cowper 's ` Task ' ( bk .
v. lines 444 , 445 ) :


`` As dreadful as the Manichean God , Adored through fear , strong only to destroy . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : William Wellesley Pole Tylney Long Wellesley ( 1788-1857 ) , one of the most worthless of the bloods of the Regency , son of Lord Maryborough , and nephew of the Duke of Wellington , became in 1845 the fourth Earl of Mornington .
He married in March , 1812 , Catherine , daughter and co-heir , with her brother , of Sir James Tylney Long , Bart. , of Draycot , Wilts .
On his marriage he added his wife 's double name to his own , and so gave a point to the authors of Rejected Addresses :


`` Long may Long-Tilney-Wellesley-Long-Pole live . ''


For Byron 's allusion to him in ` The Waltz ' , see ` Poems ' , 1898 , vol .
i. p. 484 , note 1 .
Having run through his wife 's large fortune by his extravagant expenditure at Wanstead Park and elsewhere , he was obliged , in 1822 , to escape from his creditors to the Continent .
There ( 1823-25 ) he lived with Mrs. Bligh , wife of Captain Bligh , of the Coldstream Guards .
His wife died in 1825 , after filing a bill for divorce , and making her children wards of Chancery .
Wellesley subsequently ( 1828 ) married Mrs. Bligh  but the second wife was as ill treated as the first , and he left her so destitute that she was a frequent applicant for relief at the metropolitan police-courts .
He died of heart-disease in July , 1857 , a pensioner on the charity of his cousin , the second Duke of Wellington . ]


[ Footnote 3 : Byron 's statement is incorrect .
Pierre-Auguste Caron de Beaumarchais ( 1732-1799 ) married , in 1756 , as his first wife , Madeleine-Catherine Aubertin , widow of the sieur Franquet .
She died in 1757 .
He married , in 1768 , as his second wife , Genevieve-Magdaleine Wattebled , widow of the sieur Leveque .
She died in 1770 .
The only lawsuit which he won `` before he was thirty , '' was that against Lepaute , who claimed as his own invention the escapement for watches and clocks , which Beaumarchais had discovered .
The case was decided in favour of Beaumarchais in 1754 .
Out of his second lawsuit -- with Count de la Blache , legatee of his patron Duverney , who died in 1770 -- sprang his action against Goezman , with which began the publication of his ` Memoires ' .
( See Lomenie , ` Beaumarchais and his Times ' , tr .
by H.S. Edwards , 4 vols. , London , 1855-6 . ) ]


[ Footnote 4 : Byron took his M. A. degree at Cambridge July 4 , 1808 . ]


[ Footnote 5 : Sir William Drummond ( 1770-1828 ) , Tory M.P. for St. Mawes ( 1795-96 ) and for Lostwithiel ( 1796-1801 ) , held from 1801 to 1809 several diplomatic posts : ambassador to the Court of Naples 1801-3  to the Ottoman Porte 1803-6  to the Court of Naples for the second time , 1806-9 .
From 1809 , at which date his political and diplomatic career closed , he devoted himself to literature .
He had already published ` Philosophical Sketches on the Principles of Society and Government ' ( 1793 )  ' A Review of the Governments of Sparta and Athens ' ( 1795 )  ` The Satires of Persius ' , translated ( 1798 )  ` Byblis , a Tragedy ' , in verse ( 1802 )  ` Academical Questions ' ( 1805 ) .
In 1810 he published ` Herculanensia '  and , in the following year , printed for private circulation his ` OEdipus Judaicus ' , a bold attempt to explain many parts of the Old Testament as astronomical allegories .
In 1817 appeared the first part of his ` Odin ' , a poem in blank verse  in 1824-29 his ` Origines , or Remarks on the Origin of several Empires , States , and Cities ' , was published .
Sir William , who died at Rome in 1828 , lived much of his later life abroad .


Drummond , as a member of the Alfred Club , is described in the ` Sexagenarian ' ( vol .
ii .
chap , xxiv . )
, where Beloe , speaking of the ( ` Edipus Judaicus ' ) , says that


`` he appeared to have employed his leisure in searching for objections and arguments as they related to Scripture , which had been so often refuted , that they were considered by the learned and wise as almost exploded . ''


He refers to ` Byblis ' as evidence of his `` perverted and fantastical taste '' in poetry , praises his `` spirited translation '' of Persius , commends the `` sound sense and very extensive reading '' of his ` Philosophical ' ` Sketches ' , and scoffs at the `` metaphysical labyrinth '' of his ` Academical Questions ' .


`` When you go to Naples , '' said Byron to Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , pp. 238 , 239 ) , `` you must make acquaintance with Sir William Drummond , for he is certainly one of the most erudite men and admirable philosophers now living .
He has all the wit of Voltaire , with a profundity that seldom appertains to wit , and writes so forcibly , and with such elegance and purity of style , that his works possess a peculiar charm .
Have you read his ` Academical Questions ' ?
If not , get them directly , and I think you will agree with me , that the preface to that work alone would prove Sir William Drummond an admirable writer .
He concludes it by the following sentence , which I think one of the best in our language :


'' ` Prejudice may be trusted to guard the outworks for a short space of time , while Reason slumbers in the citadel  but if the latter sink into a lethargy , the former will quickly erect a standard for herself .
Philosophy , wisdom , and liberty support each other  he who will not reason is a bigot  he who can not is a fool  and he who dares not is a slave . '


`` Is not the passage admirable ?
How few could have written it !
and yet how few read Drummond 's works !
They are too good to be popular .
His ` Odin ' is really a fine poem , and has some passages that are beautiful , but it is so little read that it may be said to have dropped still-born from the press -- a mortifying proof of the bad taste of the age .
His translation of Persius is not only very literal , but preserves much of the spirit of the original ... he has escaped all the defects of translators , and his Persius resembles the original as nearly , in feeling and sentiment , as two languages so dissimilar in idiom will admit . '' ]

[ Footnote 7 : ` The Wanderer , or Female Difficulties ' , Madame d'Arblay 's fourth and last novel ( ` Evelina ' , 1778  ` Cecilia ' , 1782  ` Camilla ' , 1796 ) , was published in 1814 .


`` I am indescribably occupied , '' she writes to Dr. Burney , October 12 , 1813 , `` in giving more and more last touches to my work , about which I begin to grow very anxious .
I am to receive merely L500 upon delivery of the MS.  the two following L500 by instalments from nine months to nine months , that is , in a year and a half from the day of publication .
If all goes well , the whole will be L3000 , but only at the end of the sale of eight thousand copies . ''


The book failed  but rumour magnified the sum received by the writer .
Mrs. Piozzi , shortly after the publication of ` The Wanderer ' and of Byron 's lines , `` Weep , daughter of a royal line , '' writes to Samuel Lysons , February 17 , 1814 :


`` Come now , do send me a kind letter and tell me if Madame d'Arblaye gets L3000 for her book or no , and if Lord Byron is to be called over about some verses he has written , as the papers hint ''

[ Footnote 8 : Dr. Johnson never saw ` Cecilia ' ( 1782 ) till it was in print .

-- To Francis Hodgson .


London , Dec. 8 , 1811 .


I sent you a sad Tale of Three Friars the other day , and now take a dose in another style .
I wrote it a day or two ago , on hearing a song of former days .


`` Away , away , ye notes of woe , '' etc. , etc. [ 1 ]


I have gotten a book by Sir W. Drummond ( printed , but not published ) , entitled OEdipus Judaicus in which he attempts to prove the greater part of the Old Testament an allegory , particularly Genesis and Joshua .
He professes himself a theist in the preface , and handles the literal interpretation very roughly .
I wish you could see it .
Mr. Ward [ 2 ] has lent it me , and I confess to me it is worth fifty Watsons .


You and Harness must fix on the time for your visit to Newstead  I can command mine at your wish , unless any thing particular occurs in the interim .
Master William Harness and I have recommenced a most fiery correspondence  I like him as Euripides liked Agatho , or Darby admired Joan , as much for the past as the present .
Bland dines with me on Tuesday to meet Moore .
Coleridge has attacked the Pleasures of Hope , and all other pleasures whatsoever .
Mr. Rogers was present , and heard himself indirectly rowed by the lecturer .
We are going in a party to hear the new Art of Poetry by this reformed schismatic [ 3 ]  and were I one of these poetical luminaries , or of sufficient consequence to be noticed by the man of lectures , I should not hear him without an answer .
For you know ,


`` an a man will be beaten with brains , he shall never keep a clean doublet . ''
[ 4 ]


Campbell [ 5 ] will be desperately annoyed .
I never saw a man ( and of him I have seen very little ) so sensitive  -- what a happy temperament !
I am sorry for it  what can he fear from criticism ?
I do n't know if Bland has seen Miller , who was to call on him yesterday .


To-day is the Sabbath , -- a day I never pass pleasantly , but at Cambridge  and , even there , the organ is a sad remembrancer .
Things are stagnant enough in town  as long as they do n't retrograde , 't is all very well .
Hobhouse writes and writes and writes , and is an author .
I do nothing but eschew tobacco .
[ 6 ] I wish parliament were assembled , that I may hear , and perhaps some day be heard  -- but on this point I am not very sanguine .
I have many plans  -- sometimes I think of the East again , and dearly beloved Greece .
I am well , but weakly .
Yesterday Kinnaird [ 7 ] told me I looked very ill , and sent me home happy .


You will never give up wine .
See what it is to be thirty !
if you were six years younger , you might leave off anything .
You drink and repent  you repent and drink .


Is Scrope still interesting and invalid ?
And how does Hinde with his cursed chemistry ?
To Harness I have written , and he has written , and we have all written , and have nothing now to do but write again , till Death splits up the pen and the scribbler .


The Alfred [ 8 ] has three hundred and fifty-four candidates for six vacancies .
The cook has run away and left us liable , which makes our committee very plaintive .
Master Brook , our head serving-man , has the gout , and our new cook is none of the best .
I speak from report , -- for what is cookery to a leguminous-eating Ascetic ?
So now you know as much of the matter as I do .
Books and quiet are still there , and they may dress their dishes in their own way for me .
Let me know your determination as to Newstead , and believe me , Yours ever ,

[ Footnote 1 : Here follows one of the ` Thyrza ' poems . ]


[ Footnote 2 : The Hon. John William Ward , afterwards fourth Earl of Dudley .
Byron said of him ( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations with Lord Byron ' , p. 197 ) ,


`` Ward is one of the best-informed men I know , and , in a ` tete-a-tete ' , is one of the most agreeable companions .
He has great originality , and , being ` tres distrait ' , it adds to the piquancy of his observations , which are sometimes somewhat ` trop naive ' , though always amusing .
This ` naivete ' of his is the more piquant from his being really a good-natured man , who unconsciously thinks aloud .
Interest Ward on a subject , and I know no one who can talk better .
His expressions are concise without being poor , and terse and epigrammatic without being affected , '' etc. .


Of somewhat the same opinion was Lady H. Leveson Gower ( ` Letters of Harriet , Countess Granville ' , vol .
i. pp. 41 , 42 ) :


`` The charm of Mr. Ward 's conversation is exactly what Mr. Luttrell wants , a sort of ` abandon ' , and being entertaining because it is his nature and he can not help it .
I only mean Mr. Ward in his happier hour , for what I have said of him is the very reverse of what he is when vanity or humour seize upon him . '' ]


[ Footnote 3 : Crabb Robinson , in his ` Diary ' for January 20 , 1812 , has the following entry :


`` In the evening at Coleridge 's lecture .
Conclusion of Milton .
Not one of the happiest of Coleridge 's efforts .
Rogers was there , and with him was Lord Byron .
He was wrapped up , but I recognized his club foot , and , indeed , his countenance and general appearance . '' ]

[ Footnote 5 : Thomas Campbell ( 1777-1844 ) lectured at the Royal Institution in 1811 on poetry .
The lectures were afterwards published in the ` New Monthly Magazine ' , of which he was editor ( 1820-30 ) .


Campbell also apparently read his lectures aloud at private houses .
Miss Berry ( ` Journal ' , vol .
ii .
p. 502 ) mentions a dinner-party on June 26 , 1812 , at the Princess of Wales 's , where she heard him read his `` first discourse , '' delivered at the Institution .
Again ( ibid. , vol .
iii .
p. 6 ) , she dined with Madame de Stael , March 9 , 1814 :


`` Nobody but Campbell the poet , Rocca , and her own daughter .
After dinner , Campbell read to us a discourse of his upon English poetry , and upon some of the great poets .
There are always signs of a poet and critic of genius in all he does , often encumbered by too ornate a style . ''


Campbell 's best work was done between 1798 and 1810 .
Within that period were published ` The Pleasures of Hope ' ( 1799 ) , ` Gertrude of Wyoming ' ( 1809 ) , and such other shorter poems as `` Hohenlinden , '' `` Ye Mariners of England , '' `` The Battle of the Baltic , '' and `` O'Connor 's Child . ''
His `` Ritter Bann , '' a reminiscence of his sojourn abroad ( 1800-1 ) , was not published till later  both it and `` The Last Man '' were published in the ` New Monthly Magazine ' , during the period of his editorship .
An excellent judge of verse , he collected ` Specimens of the British Poets ' ( 1819 ) , to which he added a valuable essay on poetry and short biographies .
His ` Theodoric ' ( 1824 ) , ` Pilgrim of Glencoe ' ( 1842 ) , and Lives of Mrs. Siddons , Petrarch , and Shakespeare added nothing to his reputation .


The judgment of contemporary poets in the main agreed with Coleridge 's estimate of Campbell 's work .


`` There are some of Campbell 's lyrics , '' said Rogers ( ` Table-Talk ' , etc. , pp. 254 , 255 ) , `` which will never die .
His ` Pleasures of Hope ' is no great favourite with me .
The ` feeling ' throughout his ` Gertrude ' is very beautiful . ''
Wordsworth also thought the ` Pleasures of Hope ' `` strangely over-rated  its fine words and sounding lines please the generality of readers , who never stop to ask themselves the meaning of a passage . ''
Byron , who calls Campbell `` a warm-hearted and honest man , '' thought that his '' ` Lochiel ' and ` Mariners ' are spirit-stirring productions  his ` Gertrude of Wyoming ' is beautiful  and some of the episodes in his ` Pleasures of Hope ' pleased me so much that I know them by heart '' .


( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations with Lord Byron ' , p. 353 ) .


George Ticknor , who met Campbell in 1815 ( ` Life ' , vol .
i. p. 63 ) , says ,


`` He is a short , small man , and has one of the roundest and most lively faces I have seen amongst this grave people .
His manners seemed as open as his countenance , and his conversation as spirited as his poetry .
He could have kept me amused till morning . ''


Shortly afterwards , Ticknor went to see him at Sydenham ( ibid. , p. 65 ) :


`` Campbell had the same good spirits and love of merriment as when I met him before , -- the same desire to amuse everybody about him  but still I could see , as I partly saw then , that he labours under the burden of an extraordinary reputation , too easily acquired , and feels too constantly that it is necessary for him to make an exertion to satisfy expectation .
The consequence is that , though he is always amusing , he is not always quite natural . ''


Sir Walter Scott made a similar remark about the numbing effect of Campbell 's reputation upon his literary work  his deference to critics ruined his individuality .
It was Scott 's admiration for `` Hohenlinden '' which induced Campbell to publish the poem .
The two men , travelling in a stage-coach alone , beguiled the way by repeating poetry .
At last Scott asked Campbell for something of his own .
He replied that there was one thing he had never printed , full of `` drums and trumpets and blunderbusses and thunder , '' and that he did not know if there was any good in it .
He then repeated `` Hohenlinden . ''
When he had finished , Scott broke out with ,


`` But , do you know , that 's devilish fine !
Why , it 's the finest thing you ever wrote , and it ` must ' be printed ! '' ]


[ Footnote 6 : See p. 31 , note 1 [ Footnote 1 of Letter 181 ] . ]


[ Footnote 7 : Douglas James William Kinnaird ( 1788-1830 ) , fifth son of the seventh Baron Kinnaird , was educated at Eton , Gottingen , and Trinity College , Cambridge .
He was an intimate friend of Hobhouse , with whom he travelled on the Continent ( 1813-14 ) , and was in political sympathy .
He represented Bishop 's Castle from July , 1819 , to March , 1820 , but losing his seat at the general election , did not again attempt to enter Parliament .
He was famous for his `` mob dinners , '' to which Moore probably refers when he writes to Byron , in an undated letter , of the `` Deipnosophist Kinnaird . ''
He was a partner in the bank of Ransom and Morland , a member of the committee for managing Drury Lane Theatre , author of the acting version of ` The Merchant of Bruges , or Beggar 's Bush ' ( acted at Drury Lane , December 14 , 1815 ) , and a member of the Radical Rota Club .


Kinnaird was Byron 's `` trusty and trustworthy trustee and banker , and crown and sheet anchor . ''
It was at his suggestion that Byron wrote the ` Hebrew Melodies ' and the ` Monody on the Death of Sheridan ' .
Talking of Kinnaird to Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , p. 215 ) , Byron said ,


`` My friend Dug is a proof that a good heart can not compensate for an irritable temper  whenever he is named , people dwell on the last and pass over the first  and yet he really has an excellent heart , and a sound head , of which I , in common with many others of his friends , have had various proofs .
He is clever , too , and well informed , and I do think would have made a figure in the world , were it not for his temper , which gives a dictatorial tone to his manner , that is offensive to the ` amour propre ' of those with whom he mixes . '' ]


[ Footnote 8 : The Alfred Club ( 1808-55 ) , established at 23 , Albemarle Street , was the Savile of the day .
Beloe , in his ` Sexagenarian ' ( vol .
ii .
chaps , xx .
- xxv . )
, describes among the members of the Symposium , as he calls it , Sir James Mackintosh , George Ellis , William Gifford , John Reeves , Sir W. Drummond , and himself .
Byron , in his ` Detached Thoughts ' , says ,


`` I was a member of the Alfred .
It was pleasant  a little too sober and literary , and bored with Sotheby and Sir Francis d'Ivernois  but one met Peel , and Ward , and Valentia , and many other pleasant or known people  and it was , upon the whole , a decent resource in a rainy day , in a dearth of parties , or parliament , or in an empty season . ''


It was , says Mr. Wheatley ( ` London Past and Present ' ) , known as the ` Half-read ' .


In a manuscript note , now for the first time printed as written , on the above passage from Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' , Sir Walter Scott writes ,


`` The Alfred , like all other clubs , was much haunted with boars , a tusky monster which delights to range where men most do congregate .
A boar , or bore , is always remarkable for something respectable , such as wealth , character , high birth , acknowledged talent , or , in short , for something that forbids people to turn him out by the shoulders , or , in other words , to cut him dead .
Much of this respectability is supplied by the mere circumstance of belonging to a certain society of clubists , within whose districts the bore obtains free-warren , and may wallow or grunt at pleasure .
Old stagers in the club know and avoid the fated corner and arm-chair which he haunts  but he often rushes from his lair on the inexperienced . '' ]

-- To Thomas Moore .


December 11 , 1811 .


My Dear Moore , -- If you please , we will drop our former monosyllables , and adhere to the appellations sanctioned by our godfathers and godmothers .
If you make it a point , I will withdraw your name  at the same time there is no occasion , as I have this day postponed your election ` sine die ' , till it shall suit your wishes to be amongst us .
I do not say this from any awkwardness the erasure of your proposal would occasion to me , but simply such is the state of the case  and , indeed , the longer your name is up , the stronger will become your probability of success , and your voters more numerous .
Of course you will decide -- your wish shall be my law .
If my zeal has already outrun discretion , pardon me , and attribute my officiousness to an excusable motive .


I wish you would go down with me to Newstead .
Hodgson will be there , and a young friend , named Harness , the earliest and dearest I ever had from the third form at Harrow to this hour .
I can promise you good wine , and , if you like shooting , a manor of 4000 acres , fires , books , your own free will , and my own very indifferent company .
` Balnea , vina , Venus ' [ 1 ] .


Hodgson will plague you , I fear , with verse  -- for my own part I will conclude , with Martial , ` nil recitabo tibi ' [ 2 ]  and surely the last inducement , is not the least .
Ponder on my proposition , and believe me , my dear Moore ,


Yours ever ,


BYRON .

Why , Hodgson !
I fear you have left off wine and me at the same time , -- I have written and written and written , and no answer !
My dear Sir Edgar [ 1 ] , water disagrees with you -- drink sack and write .
Bland did not come to his appointment , being unwell , but Moore supplied all other vacancies most delectably .
I have hopes of his joining us at Newstead .
I am sure you would like him more and more as he developes , -- at least I do .


How Miller and Bland go on , I do n't know .
Cawthorne talks of being in treaty for a novel of Madame D'Arblay 's , and if he obtains it ( at 1500 guineas !! )
wishes me to see the MS. This I should read with pleasure , -- not that I should ever dare to venture a criticism on her whose writings Dr. Johnson once revised , but for the pleasure of the thing .
If my worthy publisher wanted a sound opinion , I should send the MS. to Rogers and Moore , as men most alive to true taste .
I have had frequent letters from Wm. Harness , and you are silent  certes , you are not a schoolboy .
However , I have the consolation of knowing that you are better employed , viz .
reviewing .
You do n't deserve that I should add another syllable , and I wo n't .

Pray rummage , and do n't mind my politics .

-- To William Harness .


8 , St. James 's Street , Dec. 15 , 1811 .


I wrote you an answer to your last , which , on reflection , pleases me as little as it probably has pleased yourself .
I will not wait for your rejoinder  but proceed to tell you , that I had just then been greeted with an epistle of * * 's , full of his petty grievances , and this at the moment when ( from circumstances it is not necessary to enter upon ) I was bearing up against recollections to which his imaginary sufferings are as a scratch to a cancer .
These things combined , put me out of humour with him and all mankind .
The latter part of my life has been a perpetual struggle against affections which embittered the earliest portion  and though I flatter myself I have in a great measure conquered them , yet there are moments ( and this was one ) when I am as foolish as formerly .
I never said so much before , nor had I said this now , if I did not suspect myself of having been rather savage in my letter , and wish to inform you this much of the cause .
You know I am not one of your dolorous gentlemen : so now let us laugh again .


Yesterday I went with Moore to Sydenham to visit Campbell [ 1 ] .
He was not visible , so we jogged homeward merrily enough .
To-morrow I dine with Rogers , and am to hear Coleridge , who is a kind of rage at present .
Last night I saw Kemble in Coriolanus [ 2 ]  -- he was glorious , and exerted himself wonderfully .
By good luck I got an excellent place in the best part of the house , which was more than overflowing .
Clare [ 3 ] and Delawarr [ 4 ] , who were there on the same speculation , were less fortunate .
I saw them by accident , -- we were not together .
I wished for you , to gratify your love of Shakspeare and of fine acting to its fullest extent .
Last week I saw an exhibition of a different kind in a Mr. Coates , [ 5 ] at the Haymarket , who performed Lothario in a damned and damnable manner .


I told you the fate of B [ land ] and H [ odgson ] in my last .
So much for these sentimentalists , who console themselves in their stews for the loss -- the never to be recovered loss -- the despair of the refined attachment of a couple of drabs !
You censure my life , Harness , -- when I compare myself with these men , my elders and my betters , I really begin to conceive myself a monument of prudence -- a walking statue -- without feeling or failing  and yet the world in general hath given me a proud pre-eminence over them in profligacy .
Yet I like the men , and , God knows , ought not to condemn their aberrations .
But I own I feel provoked when they dignify all this by the name of love -- romantic attachments for things marketable for a dollar !


Dec. 16th .
-- I have just received your letter  -- I feel your kindness very deeply .
The foregoing part of my letter , written yesterday , will , I hope , account for the tone of the former , though it can not excuse it .
I do like to hear from you -- more than like .
Next to seeing you , I have no greater satisfaction .
But you have other duties , and greater pleasures , and I should regret to take a moment from either .
H * * was to call to-day , but I have not seen him .
The circumstances you mention at the close of your letter is another proof in favour of my opinion of mankind .
Such you will always find them -- selfish and distrustful .
I except none .
The cause of this is the state of society .
In the world , every one is to stir for himself -- it is useless , perhaps selfish , to expect any thing from his neighbour .
But I do not think we are born of this disposition  for you find friendship as a schoolboy , and love enough before twenty .


I went to see * *  he keeps me in town , where I do n't wish to be at present .
He is a good man , but totally without conduct .
And now , my dearest William , I must wish you good morrow , and remain ever , Most sincerely and affectionately yours , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : Campbell lived at Sydenham from 1804 to 1820 .
Moore ( Life , p. 148 ) adds the following note :


`` On this occasion , another of the noble poet 's peculiarities was , somewhat startlingly , introduced to my notice .
When we were on the point of setting out from his lodgings in St. James 's Street , it being then about midday , he said to the servant , who was shutting the door of the ` vis-a-vis ' , ` Have you put in the pistols ? '
and was answered in the affirmative .
It was difficult , -- more especially taking into account the circumstances under which we had just become acquainted , -- to keep from smiling at this singular noonday precaution . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : On December 14 , 1811 , at Covent Garden , Kemble acted `` Coriolanus '' with Mrs. Siddons as `` Volumnia . ''

[ Footnote 5 : Robert Coates , `` the Amateur of Fashion , '' known as `` Romeo '' Coates , sometimes as `` Diamond '' Coates , sometimes as `` Cock-a-doodle-doo '' Coates ( 1772-1848 ) , was the only surviving son of a wealthy West Indian planter .
He made his first appearance on the stage at Bath ( February 9 , 1810 ) , as `` Romeo . ''
In the play-bill he was announced as `` a Gentleman , 1st Appearance on any stage . ''
Genest ( ` English Stage ' , vol .

`` Many gentlemen have been weak enough to fancy themselves actors , but no one ever persevered in obtruding himself for so long a time on the notice of the public in spite of laughter , hissing , etc. ''

Mathews , at Covent Garden , imitated his performance , in Bate Dudley 's ` At Home ' , as `` Mr. Romeo Rantall , '' appearing in the

-- To Robert Rushton .
[ 1 ]


8 , St. James 's Street , Jan. 21 , 1812 .


Though I have no objection to your refusal to carry letters to Mealey 's , you will take care that the letters are taken by Spero at the proper time .
I have also to observe , that Susan is to be treated with civility , and not insulted by any person over whom I have the smallest controul , or , indeed , by any one whatever , while I have the power to protect her .
I am truly sorry to have any subject of complaint against you  I have too good an opinion of you to think I shall have occasion to repeat it , after the care I have taken of you , and my favourable intentions in your behalf .
I see no occasion for any communication whatever between you and the women , and wish you to occupy yourself in preparing for the situation in which you will be placed .
If a common sense of decency can not prevent you from conducting yourself towards them with rudeness , I should at least hope that your own interest , and regard for a master who has never treated you with unkindness , will have some weight .


Yours , etc. , BYRON .


P.S. -- I wish you to attend to your arithmetic , to occupy yourself in surveying , measuring , and making yourself acquainted with every particular relative to the land of Newstead , and you will write to me one letter every week , that I may know how you go on .


[ Footnote 1 : The two following letters , and a suppressed passage in the letter to Moore of January 29 , 1812 , refer to a quarrel among his dependents , in which Rushton , the `` little page '' of Childe Harold ( see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. pp. 224 , 242 ) , played a part .
The story is told at considerable length in a letter to Hodgson , dated January 28 , 1812 .
To the same affair probably belong the following scrap and Byron 's note :


`` Pray do n't forget me , as I shall never cease thinking of you , my Dearest ` and only Friend , ( signed ) S. H. V. ' ''


To this Byron has added this note :


`` This was written on the 11th of January , 1812  on the 28th I received ample proof that the Girl had forgotten me and herself too .
Heigho !
B. ''


The letters show , writes Moore ( ` Life ' , p. 152 ) ,


`` how gravely and coolly the young lord could arbitrate on such an occasion , and with what considerate leaning towards the servant whose fidelity he had proved , in preference to any new liking or fancy by which it might be suspected he was actuated toward the other . ''


In a MS. book written by Mrs. Heath of Newstead ( ` nee ' Rebekah Beardall ) , it is stated that the elder Rushton had as his farm-servant Fletcher , afterwards Byron 's valet .
Byron watched Fletcher and young Robert Rushton ploughing , took a fancy to both , and engaged them as his servants .
Rushton accompanied Byron to Geneva , but afterwards entered the service of James Wedderburn Webster ( see p. 2 , ` note ' 1 ) .
In 1827 he married a woman of the name of Bagnall , and with her help kept a school at Arnold , near Nottingham .
Subsequently he took a farm on the Newstead estate , named Hazelford , and shortly afterwards died , leaving a widow and three children . ]

Your refusal to carry the letter was not a subject of remonstrance : it was not a part of your business  but the language you used to the girl was ( as she stated it ) highly improper .


You say , that you also have something to complain of  then state it to me immediately : it would be very unfair , and very contrary to my disposition , not to hear both sides of the question .


If any thing has passed between you before or since my last visit to Newstead , do not be afraid to mention it .
I am sure you would not deceive me , though she would .
Whatever it is , you , shall be forgiven .
I have not been without some suspicions on the subject , and am certain that , at your time of life , the blame could not attach to you .
You will not consult , any one as to your answer , but write to me immediately .
I shall be more ready to hear what you have to advance , as I do not remember ever to have heard a word from you before against , any human being , which convinces me you would not maliciously assert an untruth .
There is not any one who can do the least injury to you , while you conduct yourself properly .
I shall expect your answer immediately .

January 29 , 1812 .


My Dear Moore , -- I wish very much I could have seen you  I am in a state of ludicrous tribulation .
***


Why do you say that I dislike your poesy [ 1 ] ?
I have expressed no such opinion , either in print or elsewhere .
In scribbling myself , it was necessary for me to find fault , and I fixed upon the trite charge of immorality , because I could discover no other , and was so perfectly qualified in the innocence of my heart , to `` pluck that mote from my neighbour 's eye . ''


I feel very , very much obliged by your approbation  but , at this moment , praise , even your praise , passes by me like `` the idle wind . ''
I meant and mean to send you a copy the moment of publication  but now I can think of nothing but damned , deceitful , -- delightful woman , as Mr. Liston says in the ` Knight of Snowdon ' [ 2 ] ?

Ever yours , most affectionately , BYRON .

Byron 's opinion of Moore 's later poetry was thus stated by him to Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , pp. 354 , 355 ) :


`` Having compared Rogers 's poems to a flower-garden , to what shall I compare Moore 's ?
-- to the Valley of Diamonds , where all is brilliant and attractive , but where one is so dazzled by the sparkling on every side that one knows not where to fix , each gem beautiful in itself , but overpowering to the eye from their quantity . '' ]

MY DEAR HODGSON,-I am rather unwell with a vile cold , caught in the House of Lords last night .
Lord Sligo and myself , being tired , paired off , being of opposite sides , so that nothing was gained or lost by our votes .
I did not speak : but I might as well , for nothing could have been inferior to the Duke of Devonshire , Marquis of Downshire , and the Earl of Fitzwilliam .
The Catholic Question comes on this month , and perhaps I may then commence .
I must `` screw my courage to the sticking-place , '' and we 'll not fail .

February 4 , 1812 .


MY DEAR SIR , -- With my best acknowledgments to Lord Holland [ 1 ] , I have to offer my perfect concurrence in the propriety of the question previously to be put to ministers .
If their answer is in the negative , I shall , with his Lordship 's approbation , give notice of a motion for a Committee of Inquiry .
I would also gladly avail myself of his most able advice , and any information or documents with which he might be pleased to intrust me , to bear me out in the statement of facts it may be necessary to submit to the House .


From all that fell under my own observation during my Christmas visit to Newstead , I feel convinced that , if conciliatory measures are not very soon adopted , the most unhappy consequences may be apprehended .
[ 2 ]


Nightly outrage and daily depredation are already at their height  and not only the masters of frames , who are obnoxious on account of their occupation , but persons in no degree connected with the malecontents or their oppressors , are liable to insult and pillage .


I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken on my account , and beg you to believe me ,


Ever your obliged and sincere , etc. .

He was Recorder of Nottingham  hence his special interest in the proposed legislation against frame-breaking . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Owing to the state of trade , numbers of stocking-weavers had lost work .
The discontent thus produced was increased by the introduction of a wide frame for the manufacture of gaiters and stockings , which , it was supposed , would further diminish the demand for manual labour .
In November , 1811 , organized bands of men began to break into houses and destroy machinery .
For several days no serious effort was made to check the riots , which extended to a considerable distance round Nottingham .
But on November 14 the soldiers were called out .
Between that date and December 9 , 900 cavalry and 1000 infantry were sent to Nottingham  and , on January 8 , 1812 , these forces were increased by two additional regiments .
The rioters assumed the name of Luddites , and their leader was known as General Lud .
The name is said to have originated in 1779 , in a Leicestershire village , where a half-witted lad , named Ned Lud , broke a stocking-frame in a fit of passion  hence the common saying , when machinery was broken , that `` Ned Lud '' did it .
A Bill was introduced in the House of Commons ( February 14 ) increasing the severity of punishments for frame-breaking .
On the second reading ( February 17 ) Sir Samuel Romilly strongly opposed the measure , which passed its third reading ( February 20 ) without a division .
The Bill , as introduced into the Upper House by Lord Liverpool ,


( 1 ) rendered the offence of frame-breaking punishable by death  and ( 2 ) compelled persons in whose houses the frames were broken to give information to the magistrates .


On the second reading of the Bill ( February 27 , 1812 ) , Byron spoke against it in his first speech in the House of Lords ( see Appendix II .
( i ) ) .
The Bill passed its third reading on March 5 , and became law as 52 Geo .
III .
c. 16 .
Byron did not confine his opposition to a speech in the House of Lords .
He also addressed `` An Ode to the Framers of the Frame Bill , '' which appeared in the ` Morning Chronicle ' on Monday , March 2 , 1812 .
The following letter to Perry , the editor , is published by permission of Messrs. Ellis and Elvey , in whose possession is the original :


`` Sir , -- I take the liberty of sending an alteration of the two last lines of Stanza 2'd which I wish to run as follows ,


'' ` Gibbets on Sherwood will heighten the Scenery Shewing how Commerce , how Liberty thrives ! '


`` I wish you could insert it tomorrow for a particular reason  but I feel much obliged by your inserting it at all .
Of course , do not put my name to the thing .

MY DEAR JOHN , -- You have probably long ago forgotten the writer of these lines , who would , perhaps , be unable to recognize yourself , from the difference which must naturally have taken place in your stature and appearance since he saw you last .
I have been rambling through Portugal , Spain , Greece , etc. , etc. , for some years , and have found so many changes on my return , that it would be very unfair not to expect that you should have had your share of alteration and improvement with the rest .
I write to request a favour of you : a little boy of eleven years , the son of Mr. ** , my particular friend , is about to become an Etonian , and I should esteem any act of protection or kindness to him as an obligation to myself : let me beg of you then to take some little notice of him at first , till he is able to shift for himself .


I was happy to hear a very favourable account of you from a schoolfellow a few weeks ago , and should be glad to learn that your family are as well as I wish them to be .
I presume you are in the upper school  -- as an Etonian , you will look down upon a Harrow man  but I never , even in my boyish days , disputed your superiority , which I once experienced in a cricket match , where I had the honour of making one of eleven , who were beaten to their hearts ' content by your college in one innings .

Believe me to be , with great truth , etc. , etc. ,

[ Footnote 1 :


`` Breakfasted with Mr. Cowell , '' writes Moore , in his Diary , June 11 , 1828 , `` having made his acquaintance for the purpose of gaining information about Lord Byron .
Knew Byron for the first time when he himself was a little boy , from being in the habit of playing with B. 's dogs .
Byron wrote to him to school to bid him mind his prosody .
Gave me two or three of his letters to him .
Saw a good deal of B. at Hastings  mentioned the anecdote about the ink-bottle striking one of the lead Muses .
These Muses had been brought from Holland  and there were , I think , only eight of them arrived safe .
Fletcher had brought B. a large jar of ink , and , not thinking it was full , B. had thrust his pen down to the very bottom  his anger at finding it come out all besmeared with ink made him chuck the jar out of the window , when it knocked down one of the Muses in the garden , and deluged her with ink .
In 1813 , when B. was at Salt Hill , he had Cowell over from Eton , and ` pouched ' him no less than ten pounds .
Cowell has ever since kept one of the notes .
Told me a curious anecdote of Byron 's mentioning to him , as if it had made a great impression on him , their seeing Shelley ( as they thought ) walking into a little wood at Lerici , when it was discovered afterwards that Shelley was at that time in quite another direction .
` This , ' said Byron , in a sort of awe-struck voice , ` was about ten days before his death . '
Cowell 's imitation of his look and manner very striking .
Thinks that in Byron 's speech to Fletcher , when he was dying , threatening to appear to him , there was a touch of that humour and fun which he was accustomed to mix up with everything '' .

Dear Hodgson , -- I send you a proof .
Last week I was very ill and confined to bed with stone in the kidney , but I am now quite recovered .
The women are gone to their relatives , after many attempts to explain what was already too clear .
If the stone had got into my heart instead of my kidneys , it would have been all the better .
However , I have quite recovered that also , and only wonder at my folly in excepting my own strumpets from the general corruption , -- albeit a two months ' weakness is better than ten years .
I have one request to make , which is , never mention a woman again in any letter to me , or even allude to the existence of the sex .
I wo n't even read a word of the feminine gender  -- it must all be ` propria quae maribus ' .


In the spring of 1813 I shall leave England for ever .
Every thing in my affairs tends to this , and my inclinations and health do not discourage it .
Neither my habits nor constitution are improved by your customs or your climate .
I shall find employment in making myself a good Oriental scholar .
I shall retain a mansion in one of the fairest islands , and retrace , at intervals , the most interesting portions of the East .
In the mean time , I am adjusting my concerns , which will ( when arranged ) leave me with wealth sufficient even for home , but enough for a principality in Turkey .
At present they are involved , but I hope , by taking some necessary but unpleasant steps , to clear every thing .
Hobhouse is expected daily in London : we shall be very glad to see him  and , perhaps , you will come up and `` drink deep ere he depart , '' if not , `` Mahomet must go to the mountain  '' [ 1 ] -- but Cambridge will bring sad recollections to him , and worse to me , though for very different reasons .
I believe the only human being , that ever loved me in truth and entirely , was of , or belonging to , Cambridge , and , in that , no change can now take place .
There is one consolation in death -- where he sets his seal , the impression can neither be melted nor broken , but endureth for ever .


Yours always ,


B .


P.S. -- I almost rejoice when one I love dies young , for I could never bear to see them old or altered .


[ Footnote 1 : See Bacon 's ` Essays ' ( `` Of Boldness '' ) :


`` Mahomet made the people believe that he would call a hill to him , and from the top of it offer up his prayers for the observers of his law .
The people assembled  Mahomet called the hill to come to him , again and again  and when the hill stood still , he was never a whit abashed , but said , ` If the hill will not come to Mahomet , Mahomet will go to the hill . ' '' ]

My Dear Hodgson , -- There is a book entituled Galt , his Travels in ye Archipelago , [ 1 ] daintily printed by Cadell and Davies , ye which I could desiderate might be criticised by you , inasmuch as ye author is a well-respected esquire of mine acquaintance , but I fear will meet with little mercy as a writer , unless a friend passeth judgment .
Truth to say , ye boke is ye boke of a cock-brained man , and is full of devises crude and conceitede , but peradventure for my sake this grace may be vouchsafed unto him .
Review him myself I can not , will not , and if you are likewize hard of heart , woe unto ye boke !
ye which is a comely quarto .


Now then !
I have no objection to review , if it pleases Griffiths [ 2 ] to send books , or rather you , for you know the sort of things I like to [ play ] with .
You will find what I say very serious as to my intentions .
I have every reason to induce me to return to Ionia .

[ Footnote 1 : John Galt ( 1779-1839 ) published in 1812 his ` Voyages and Travels in the Years 1809 , 1810 , and 1811 ' .

i. p. 243 , ` note ' 1 [ Footnote 1 of Letter 130 ]  see also ` ibid . '
, p. 304 , ` note ' 2 [ Footnote 2 of Letter 131 ] .
Galt 's novels were , in later years , liked by Byron , who


`` praised the ` Annals of the Parish ' very highly , as also ` The Entail ' ... some scenes of which , he said , had affected him very much .
` The characters in Mr. Galt 's novels have an identity , ' added Byron , ` that reminds me of Wilkie 's pictures ' ''


( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations with Lord Byron ' , p. 74 ) .


`` When I knew Galt , years ago , '' said Byron to Lady Blessington , `` I was not in a frame of mind to form an impartial opinion of him : his mildness and equanimity struck me even then  but , to say the truth , his manner had not deference enough for my then aristocratical taste , and finding I could not awe him into a respect sufficiently profound for my sublime self , either as a peer or an author , I felt a little grudge towards him that has now completely worn off , '' etc. , etc. .

[ Footnote 2 : George Edward Griffiths ( circ .
1769-1829 ) , son of Ralph Griffiths , who founded , owned , and published the ` Monthly Review ' , and boarded and lodged Oliver Goldsmith as a contributor , succeeded to the management of the ` Review ' on the death of his father in 1803 .
He edited it till 1825 , when he sold the property .
He lived at Linden House , Turnham Green .
Francis Hodgson wrote for the ` Monthly Review ' , and , March 2 , 1814 , he writes to Byron ,


`` I have already read a review of Safie in the ` British Critic ' , and will undertake it in the ` Monthly ' if Griffiths , with whom I am in very bad odour from my late shameful idleness , will allow me .
Oh that you would write a good smart critique of something to get both ` yourself and me ' in high repute at Turnham Green !!!! ''


In Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' occurs the following passage :


`` I have been a reviewer .
In the ` Monthly Review ' I wrote some articles which were inserted .
This was in the latter part of 1811 .
In 1807 , in a Magazine called ` Monthly Literary Recreations ' , I reviewed Wordsworth 's trash of that time .


`` Excepting these , I can not accuse myself of anonymous Criticism ( that I recollect ) , though I have been ` offered ' more than one review in our principal Journals . ''


In the Bodleian Library is a copy of the ` Monthly Review ' , in which Griffiths has entered the initials of the authors of each article .

-- To Lord Holland .


8 , St. James 's Street , February 25 , 1812 .


MY LORD , -- With my best thanks , I have the honour to return the Notts , letter to your Lordship .
I have read it with attention , but do not think I shall venture to avail myself of its contents , as my view of the question differs in some measure from Mr. Coldham 's .
I hope I do not wrong him , but his objections to the bill appear to me to be founded on certain apprehensions that he and his coadjutors might be mistaken for the `` original advisers '' ( to quote him ) of the measure .
For my own part , I consider the manufacturers as a much injured body of men , sacrificed to the views of certain individuals who have enriched themselves by those practices which have deprived the frame-workers of employment .
For instance  -- by the adoption of a certain kind of frame , one man performs the work of seven -- six are thus thrown out of business .
But it is to be observed that the work thus done is far inferior in quality , hardly marketable at home , and hurried over with a view to exportation .
Surely , my Lord , however we may rejoice in any improvement in the arts which may be beneficial to mankind , we must not allow mankind to be sacrificed to improvements in mechanism .
The maintenance and well-doing of the industrious poor is an object of greater consequence to the community than the enrichment of a few monopolists by any improvement in the implements of trade , which deprives the workman of his bread , and renders the labourer `` unworthy of his hire . ''


My own motive for opposing the bill is founded on its palpable injustice , and its certain inefficacy .
I have seen the state of these miserable men , and it is a disgrace to a civilized country .
Their excesses may be condemned , but can not be subject of wonder .
The effect of the present bill would be to drive them into actual rebellion .
The few words I shall venture to offer on Thursday will be founded upon these opinions formed from my own observations on the spot .
By previous inquiry , I am convinced these men would have been restored to employment , and the county to tranquillity .
It is , perhaps , not yet too late , and is surely worth the trial .
It can never be too late to employ force in such circumstances .
I believe your Lordship does not coincide with me entirely on this subject , and most cheerfully and sincerely shall I submit to your superior judgment and experience , and take some other line of argument against the bill , or be silent altogether , should you deem it more advisable .
Condemning , as every one must condemn , the conduct of these wretches , I believe in the existence of grievances which call rather for pity than punishment .
I have the honour to be , with great respect , my Lord , your Lordship 's


Most obedient and obliged servant ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- I am a little apprehensive that your Lordship will think me too lenient towards these men , and half a frame-breaker myself .

MY DEAR HODGSON , -- We are not answerable for reports of speeches in the papers  they are always given incorrectly , and on this occasion more so than usual , from the debate in the Commons on the same night .
The Morning Post should have said eighteen years .
However , you will find the speech , as spoken , in the Parliamentary Register , when it comes out .
Lords Holland and Grenville , particularly the latter , paid me some high compliments in the course of their speeches , as you may have seen in the papers , and Lords Eldon and Harrowby answered me .
I have had many marvellous eulogies [ 1 ] repeated to me since , in person and by proxy , from divers persons ministerial -- yea , ministerial !
-- as well as oppositionists  of them I shall only mention Sir F. Burdett .
He says it is the best speech by a lord since the `` Lord knows when , '' probably from a fellow-feeling in the sentiments .
Lord H. tells me I shall beat them all if I persevere  and Lord G. remarked that the construction of some of my periods are very like Burke 's !!
And so much for vanity .
I spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence , abused every thing and every body , and put the Lord Chancellor very much out of humour : and if I may believe what I hear , have not lost any character by the experiment .
As to my delivery , loud and fluent enough , perhaps a little theatrical .
I could not recognize myself or any one else in the newspapers [ 2 ] .


I hire myself unto Griffiths , and my poesy [ 3 ] comes out on Saturday .
Hobhouse is here  I shall tell him to write .
My stone is gone for the present , but I fear is part of my habit .
We all talk of a visit to Cambridge .


Yours ever ,

Grenville said ,


`` There never was a maxim of greater wisdom than that uttered by the noble lord [ Byron ] who had so ably addressed their lordships that night for the first time ''


( ` Hansard ' , vol .
xxi .
p. 977 ) .
Moore quotes a passage from Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' :


`` Sheridan 's liking for me ( whether he was not mystifying me I do not know , but Lady Caroline Lamb and others told me that he said the same both before and after he knew me ) was founded upon ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ' .
He told me that he did not care about poetry ( or about mine -- at least , any but ` that ' poem of mine ) , but he was sure , from ` that ' and other symptoms , I should make an orator , if I would but take to speaking , and grow a parliament man .
He never ceased harping upon this to me to the last  and I remember my old tutor , Dr. Drury , had the same notion when I was a ` boy '  but it never was my turn of inclination to try .
I spoke once or twice , as all young peers do , as a kind of introduction into public life  but dissipation , shyness , haughty and reserved opinions , together with the short time I lived in England after my majority ( only about five years in all ) , prevented me from resuming the experiment .
As far as it went , it was not discouraging , particularly my ` first ' speech ( I spoke three or four times in all )  but just after it , my poem of ` Childe Harold ' was published , and nobody ever thought about my ` prose ' afterwards , nor indeed did I  it became to me a secondary and neglected object , though I sometimes wonder to myself if I should have succeeded . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : Byron , writing to John Hanson , February 28 , 1812 , says :


`` Dear Sir , -- In the report of my speech ( which by the bye is given very incorrectly ) in the 'M [ orning ] Herald ' , ` Day ' , and ` B [ ritish ] Press ' , they state that I mentioned ` Bristol ' , a place I never saw in my life and knew nothing of whatever , nor ` mentioned ' at all last night .
Will you be good enough to send to these ` papers ' ` immediately ' , and have the mistake corrected , or I shall get into a scrape with the Bristol people ?

You have already so fully proved the truth of the first line of Pope 's couplet [ 2 ] ,


`` Forgiveness to the injured doth belong , ''


that I long for an opportunity to give the lie to the verse that follows .
If I were not perfectly convinced that any thing I may have formerly uttered in the boyish rashness of my misplaced resentment had made as little impression as it deserved to make , I should hardly have the confidence -- perhaps your Lordship may give it a stronger and more appropriate appellation -- to send you a quarto of the same scribbler .
But your Lordship , I am sorry to observe to-day , is troubled with the gout  if my book can produce a laugh against itself or the author , it will be of some service .
If it can set you to sleep , the benefit will be yet greater  and as some facetious personage observed half a century ago , that `` poetry is a mere drug , '' [ 3 ]


I offer you mine as a humble assistant to the eau medicinale .
I trust you will forgive this and all my other buffooneries , and believe me to be , with great respect ,

[ Footnote 1 : ` Childe Harold ' was published March 1 , 1812 .

`` To Augusta , my dearest sister , and my best friend , who has ever loved me much better than I deserved , this volume is presented by her father 's son , and most affectionate brother , B. ''


The effect which the poem instantly produced is best expressed in Byron 's own memorandum :


`` I awoke one morning and found myself famous . ''


He was only just twenty-three years old .


`` The subject , '' says Elizabeth , Duchess of Devonshire ( ` Two Duchesses ' , pp. 375 , 376 ) , `` of conversation , of curiosity , of enthusiasm almost , one might say , of the moment is not Spain or Portugal , Warriors or Patriots , but Lord Byron ! ''
`` He returned , '' she continues , `` sorry for the severity of some of his lines ( in the ` English Bards ' ) , and with a new poem , ` Childe Harold ' , which he published .
This poem is on every table , and himself courted , visited , flattered , and praised whenever he appears .
He has a pale , sickly , but handsome countenance , a bad figure , and , in short , he is really the only topic almost of every conversation -- the men jealous of him , the women of each other . ''


`` Lord Byron , '' writes Lady Harriet Leveson Gower to the Duke of Devonshire , May 10 , 1812 ( ` Letters of Harriet , Countess Granville ' , vol .
i. p. 34 ) , `` is still upon a pedestal , and Caroline William doing homage .
I have made acquaintance with him .
He is agreeable , but I feel no wish for any further intimacy .
His countenance is fine when it is in repose  but the moment it is in play , suspicious , malignant , and consequently repulsive .
His manner is either remarkably gracious and conciliatory , with a tinge of affectation , or irritable and impetuous , and then , I am afraid , perfectly natural . ''


Rogers ( ` Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers ' , pp. 232 , 233 ) says ,


`` After Byron had become the ` rage ' , I was frequently amused at the manoeuvres of certain noble ladies to get acquainted with him by means of me  for instance , I would receive a note from Lady -- , requesting the pleasure of my company on a particular evening , with a postscript , ` Pray , could you not contrive to bring Lord Byron with you ? '
Once , at a great party given by Lady Jersey , Mrs. Sheridan ran up to me and said , ` Do , as a favour , try if you can place Lord Byron beside me at supper ! ' '' ]

MARCH , 1812 -- MAY , 1813 .


THE IDOL OF SOCIETY -- THE DRURY LANE ADDRESS -- SECOND SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT .


* * * * *


229 .
-- To Thomas Moore .


With regard to the passage on Mr. Way 's loss , no unfair play was hinted at , as may be seen by referring to the book [ 1 ]  and it is expressly added that the managers were ignorant of that transaction .
As to the prevalence of play at the Argyle , it can not be denied that there were billiards and dice  -- Lord B. has been a witness to the use of both at the Argyle Rooms .
These , it is presumed , come under the denomination of play .
If play be allowed , the President of the Institution can hardly complain of being termed the `` Arbiter of Play , '' -- or what becomes of his authority ?


Lord B. has no personal animosity to Colonel Greville .
A public institution , to which he himself was a subscriber , he considered himself to have a right to notice publickly .
Of that institution Colonel Greville was the avowed director  -- it is too late to enter into the discussion of its merits or demerits .


Lord B. must leave the discussion of the reparation , for the real or supposed injury , to Colonel G. 's friend and Mr. Moore , the friend of Lord B. -- begging them to recollect that , while they consider Colonel G. 's honour , Lord B. must also maintain his own .
If the business can be settled amicably , Lord B. will do as much as can and ought to be done by a man of honour towards conciliation  -- if not , he must satisfy Colonel G. in the manner most conducive to his further wishes .


[ Footnote 1 : Byron , in ` English Bards , etc. ' ( lines 638-667 ) , had alluded to Colonel Greville , Manager of the Argyle Institution :


`` Or hail at once the patron and the pile Of vice and folly , Greville and Argyle , '' etc. .


In a note he had also referred to `` Billy '' Way 's loss of several thousand pounds in the Rooms .
On his return from abroad , Colonel Greville demanded satisfaction through his friend Gould Francis Leckie .
Byron referred Leckie to Moore , and sent Moore the above paper for his guidance .
The affair was amicably settled .


In his ` Detached Thoughts ' occurs the following passage : --


`` I have been called in as mediator , or second , at least twenty times , in violent quarrels , and have always contrived to settle the business without compromising the honour of the parties , or leading them to mortal consequences , and this , too , sometimes in very difficult and delicate circumstances , and having to deal with very hot and haughty spirits , -- Irishmen , gamesters , guardsmen , captains , and cornets of horse , and the like .
This was , of course , in my youth , when I lived in hot-headed company .
I have had to carry challenges from gentlemen to noblemen , from captains to captains , from lawyers to counsellors , and once from a clergyman to an officer in the Life Guards  but I found the latter by far the most difficult :


'' ` to compose The bloody duel without blows , '


`` the business being about a woman : I must add , too , that I never saw a woman behave so ill , like a cold-blooded , heartless b -- as she was , -- but very handsome for all that .
A certain Susan C -- was she called .
I never saw her but once  and that was to induce her but to say two words ( which in no degree compromised herself ) , and which would have had the effect of saving a priest or a lieutenant of cavalry .
She would not say them , and neither Nepean nor myself [ the son of Sir Evan Nepean , and a friend to one of the parties ] could prevail upon her to say them , though both of us used to deal in some sort with womankind .
At last I managed to quiet the combatants without her talisman , and , I believe , to her great disappointment : she was the damnedest b -- that I ever saw , and I have seen a great many .
Though my clergyman was sure to lose either his life or his living , he was as warlike as the Bishop of Beauvais , and would hardly be pacified  but then he was in love , and that is a martial passion . ''


One challenge from a gentleman to a nobleman was that of Scrope Davies to Lord Foley , in 1813  but Byron succeeded in arranging the matter .
That from a lawyer to a counsellor was in 1815 , from John Hanson to Serjeant Best , afterwards Lord Wynford , and arose out of the marriage of Miss Hanson to Lord Portsmouth  this quarrel was also settled by Byron .
The case of the clergyman was that of the Rev. Robert Bland , whose mistress , during his absence in Holland , left him for an officer in the Guards ( see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 197 , end of ` note ' [ Footnote 1 of Letter 102 ] on Francis Hodgson ) .
Byron was himself a fair shot with a pistol .


`` When in London , '' writes Gronow ( ` Reminiscences ' , vol .
i. p. 152 ) , `` Byron used to go to Manton 's shooting-gallery , in Davies Street , to try his hand , as he said , at a wafer .
Wedderburn Webster was present when the poet , intensely delighted with his own skill , boasted to Joe Manton that he considered himself the best shot in London .
` No , my lord , ' replied Manton , ` not the best  but your shooting to-day was respectable . '
Whereupon Byron waxed wroth , and left the shop in a violent passion . '' ]

-- To William Bankes .


My dear Bankes , -- My eagerness to come to an explanation has , I trust , convinced you that whatever my unlucky manner might inadvertently be , the change was as unintentional as ( if intended ) it would have been ungrateful .
I really was not aware that , while we were together , I had evinced such caprices  that we were not so much in each other 's company as I could have wished , I well know , but I think so acute an observer as yourself must have perceived enough to explain this , without supposing any slight to one in whose society I have pride and pleasure .
Recollect that I do not allude here to `` extended '' or `` extending '' acquaintances , but to circumstances you will understand , I think , on a little reflection .


And now , my dear Bankes , do not distress me by supposing that I can think of you , or you of me , otherwise than I trust we have long thought .
You told me not long ago that my temper was improved , and I should be sorry that opinion should be revoked .
Believe me , your friendship is of more account to me than all those absurd vanities in which , I fear , you conceive me to take too much interest .
I have never disputed your superiority , or doubted ( seriously ) your good will , and no one shall ever `` make mischief between us '' without the sincere regret on the part of your ever affectionate , etc. .


P.S. -- I shall see you , I hope , at Lady Jersey 's [ 1 ] .


Hobhouse goes also .


[ Footnote 1 : George Child-Villiers ( 1773-1859 ) , `` in manners and appearance ` le plus grand seigneur ' of his time , '' succeeded his father , `` the Prince of Maccaronies , '' in 1805 , as fifth Earl of Jersey .
He was twice Lord Chamberlain to William IV. , and twice Master of the Horse to Queen Victoria .
He married , in 1804 , Lady Sarah Sophia Fane , eldest daughter of John , tenth Earl of Westmorland , and heiress , through her mother , ` nee ' Sarah Anne Child , of the fortune of her grandfather , Robert Child , the banker .


Lady Jersey for many years reigned supreme , by her beauty and wit , in London society ,


`` the veriest tyrant , '' said Byron , `` that ever governed Fashion 's fools , and compelled them to shake their caps and bells as she willed it . ''


At Almack 's , where , according to Gronow ( ` Reminiscences ' , vol .
i. p. 32 ) , she introduced the quadrille after Waterloo , she was a despot .
` Almack 's ' , the very clever and personal picture of fashionable life , published in 1826 , is dedicated


`` To that most Distinguished and Despotic Conclave , composed of their High Mightinesses the Ladies Patronesses of the Balls at Almack 's , the Rulers of Fashion , the Arbiters of Taste , the Leaders of ` Ton ' , and the Makers of Manners , whose Sovereign sway over ` the world ' of London has long been established on the firmest basis , whose Decrees are Laws , and from whose judgment there is no appeal . ''


Over this `` Willis Coalition Cabinet '' Lady Jersey , as `` Lady Hauton , '' is described as reigning supreme .


`` She knew more than any person I ever met with , and both everything and everybody  she could quiz and she could flatter . ''


`` Treat people like fools , '' she is supposed to say , `` and they will worship you  stoop to make up to them , and they will directly tread you underfoot . ''


Ticknor ( ` Life ' , vol .
i. p. 269 ) speaks of her as a `` beautiful creature , with a great deal of talent , taste , and elegant knowledge . ''
He was at Almack 's , in 1819 , and standing close to Lady Jersey , then at the height of beauty and brilliant talent , a leader in society , and with decided political opinions , when she refused the Duke of Wellington admittance .
The lady patronesses had made a rule to admit no one after eleven o'clock .
When the rule first came into operation , Ticknor heard one of the attendants announce that the Duke of Wellington was at the door .


`` What o'clock is it ? ''
Lady Jersey asked .
`` Seven minutes after eleven , your ladyship . ''
She paused a moment , and then said , with emphasis and distinctness , `` Give my compliments , -- give Lady Jersey 's compliments to the Duke of Wellington , and say that she is very glad that the first enforcement of the rule of exclusion is such that hereafter no one can complain of its application .
He can not be admitted ''


( ` ibid ' .
, vol .
i. pp. 296 , 297 ) .


Politically , Lady Jersey was a power .
Such an entry as the following sounds strange to modern readers : Dining at Lord Holland 's , in 1835 , in company with Lord Melbourne , Lord Grey , and other prominent politicians , Ticknor notes that


`` public business was much talked about -- the corporation bill , the motion for admitting Dissenters to the universities , etc. , etc.  and as to the last , when the question arose whether it would be debated on Tuesday night , it was admitted to be doubtful whether Lady Jersey would not succeed in getting it postponed , as she has a grand dinner that evening ''


( ` Life ' , vol .
i. pp. 409 , 410 ) .


Lady Jersey , whose mother-in-law , ` nee ' Frances Twyden , had been a bitter opponent of the Princess of Wales , provoked the wrath of the Regent by espousing the cause of his wife .
The Prince was determined to break off this friendship with his wife 's champion , and sent a letter to her by the hand of Colonel Willis , announcing his determination .
Some time later they met at a great party given by Henry Hope in Cavendish Square .
Lady Jersey was walking with Rogers in the gallery , when they met the Prince , who


`` stopped for a moment , and then , drawing himself up , marched past her with a look of the utmost disdain .
Lady Jersey returned the look to the full  and , as soon as the Prince was gone , said to me , with a smile , ` Did n't I do it well ? ' ''


( ` Table Talk of Samuel Rogers ' , pp. 267 , 268 ) .


From this same change of feeling arose the incident which Byron celebrated in his Condolatory Address `` On the Occasion of the Prince Regent Returning her Picture to Mrs. Mee . ''
The lines were enclosed with a letter which is printed at the date May 29 , 1814 .
`` Pegasus is , perhaps , the only horse of whose paces , '' said Byron ( ` Conversations with Lady Blessington ' , p. 51 ) , `` Lord [ Jersey ] could not be a judge . ''
Of Lady Jersey he says ( ` ibid ' .
, p. 50 ) ,


`` Of all that coterie , Madame [ de Stael ] , after Lady [ Jersey ] , was the best  at least I thought so , for these two ladies were the only ones who ventured to protect me when all London was crying out against me on the separation , and they behaved courageously and kindly ... Poor dear Lady [ Jersey ] !
Does she still retain her beautiful cream-coloured complexion and raven hair ?
I used to long to tell her that she spoiled her looks by her excessive animation  for eyes , tongue , head , and arms were all in movement at once , and were only relieved from their active service by want of respiration , '' etc. , etc. ]

-- To Thomas Moore .


March 25 , 1812 .


Know all men by these presents , that you , Thomas Moore , stand indicted -- no -- invited , by special and particular solicitation , to Lady Caroline Lamb 's [ 1 ] tomorrow evening , at half-past nine o'clock , where you will meet with a civil reception and decent entertainment .
Pray , come -- I was so examined after you this morning , that I entreat you to answer in person .


Believe me , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : Lady Caroline Lamb ( 1785-1828 ) , the `` Calantha Avondale '' of her own ` Glenarvon ' , was the daughter of Frederick Ponsonby , third Earl of Bessborough , by his wife , Lady Henrietta Frances Spencer , sister of Georgiana , Duchess of Devonshire .
She was brought up , partly in Italy under the care of a servant , partly by her grandmother , the wife of John , first Earl Spencer .
She married , June 3 , 1805 , William Lamb , afterwards Lord Melbourne .


Her manuscript commonplace-book is in the possession of the Hon. G. Ponsonby .
A few pages are taken up with a printed copy of the ` Essay on the Progressive Improvement of Mankind ' , with which her husband won the declamation prize at Trinity , Cambridge , in 1798 .
The rest of the volume consists of some 200 pages filled with prose , and verse , and sketches .
It begins with a list of her nicknames -- `` Sprite , '' `` Young Savage , '' `` Ariel , '' `` Squirrel , '' etc. .
Then follow the secret language of an imaginary order  her first verses , written at the age of thirteen  scraps of poetry , original and extracted , in French , Italian , and English  a long fragment of a wild romantic story of a girl 's seduction by an infidel nobleman .
A clever sketch in water-colour of William Lamb and of herself , after their marriage , is followed by verses on the birth of her son , `` little `` Augustus , '' August 23 , 1807 .
The last stanza of a poem , which has nothing to commend it except the feelings of the wife and mother which it expresses , runs thus :


`` His little eyes like William 's shine  How great is then my joy , For , while I call this darling mine , I see 't is William 's boy ! ''


The most ambitious effort in the volume is a poem , illustrated with pictures in water colours , such as ` L'Amour se cache sous le voile d'Amitie , or l'Innocence le recoit dans ses bras '  a third , in the style of Blake , bears the inscription ` le Desespoir met fin a ses jours ' .
The poem opens with the following lines :


`` Winged with Hope and hushed with Joy , See yon wanton , blue-eyed Boy , -- Arch his smile , and keen his dart , -- Aim at Laura 's youthful heart !
How could he his wiles disguise ?
How deceive such watchful eyes ?
How so pure a breast inspire , Set so young a Mind on fire ?
'T was because to raise the flame Love bethought of friendship 's name .
Under this false guise he told her That he lived but to behold her .
How could she his fault discover When he often vowed to love her ?
How could she her heart defend When he took the name of friend ? ''


Dates are seldom affixed to the compositions , and it is impossible to say whether any are autobiographical .
But , taken as a whole , they reveal a clever , romantic , impulsive , imaginative woman , whose pet names describe at once the charm of her character and the fascination of her small , slight figure , `` golden hair , large hazel eyes , '' and low musical voice .


Her marriage with William Lamb , June 3 , seems to have been at first kept secret .
Lord Minto in August , 1805 ( ` Life and Letters ' , vol .
iii .
p. 361 ) , speaks of her as unmarried , and adds that she is `` a lively and rather a pretty girl  they say she is very clever . ''
Augustus Foster , writing to his mother , Lady Elizabeth Foster , July 30 , 1805 ( ` The Two Duchesses ' , p. 233 ) , says , `` I can not fancy Lady Caroline married .
I can not be glad of it .
How changed she must be -- the delicate Ariel , the little Fairy Queen become a wife and soon perhaps a mother . ''
Lady Elizabeth replies , September 30 , 1805 ( ` ibid ' .
, p. 242 ) : `` You may retract all your sorrow about Caro Ponsonby 's marriage , for she is the same wild , delicate , odd , delightful person , unlike everything . ''


Lady Caroline and William Lamb are described by Lady Elizabeth , three months later , as `` flirting all day long ' e felice adesso ' . ''
The phrase , perhaps , correctly expresses Lady Caroline 's conception of love as an episode  but no breach occurred till 1813 .
In the previous year , when Byron had suddenly risen to the height of his fame , she had refused to be introduced by Lady Westmorland to the man of whom she made the famous entry in her Diary `` mad , bad , and dangerous to know . ''
But they met , a few days later , at Holland House , and Byron called on her in Whitehall , where for the next four months he was a daily visitor .
On blue-bordered paper , embossed at the corners with scallop-shells , she wrote to Byron at an early stage in their acquaintance , the letter numbered 1 in Appendix III .


For the sequel to the story of their friendship , see Byron 's letter to Lady Caroline , p. 135 , ` note ' 1 , and Appendix III . ]

-- To Lady Caroline Lamb .


[ Undated . ]


I never supposed you artful : we are all selfish , -- nature did that for us .
But even when you attempt deceit occasionally , you can not maintain it , which is all the better  want of success will curb the tendency .
Every word you utter , every line you write , proves you to be either sincere or a fool .
Now as I know you are not the one , I must believe you the other .


I never knew a woman with greater or more pleasing talents , general as in a woman they should be , something of everything , and too much of nothing .
But these are unfortunately coupled with a total want of common conduct .
[ 1 ] For instance , the note to your page -- do you suppose I delivered it ?
or did you mean that I should ?
I did not of course .


Then your heart , my poor Caro ( what a little volcano ! )
, that pours lava through your veins  and yet I can not wish it a bit colder , to make a marble slab of , as you sometimes see ( to understand my foolish metaphor ) brought in vases , tables , etc. , from Vesuvius , when hardened after an eruption .
To drop my detestable tropes and figures , you know I have always thought you the cleverest , most agreeable , absurd , amiable , perplexing , dangerous , fascinating little being that lives now , or ought to have lived 2000 years ago .
I wo n't talk to you of beauty  I am no judge .
But our beauties cease to be so when near you , and therefore you have either some , or something better .
And now , Caro , this nonsense is the first and last compliment ( if it be such ) I ever paid you .
You have often reproached me as wanting in that respect  but others will make up the deficiency .


Come to Lord Grey 's  at least do not let me keep you away .
All that you so often say , I feel .
Can more be said or felt ?
This same prudence is tiresome enough  but one must maintain it , or what can one do to be saved ?
Keep to it .


[ Footnote 1 : The following letter from Lady Caroline to Fletcher , Byron 's valet , illustrates the statement in the text :


`` FLETCHER , -- Will you come and see me here some evening at 9 , and no one will know of it .
You may say you bring a letter , and wait the answer .
I will send for you in .
But I will let you know first , for I wish to speak with you .
I also want you to take the little Foreign Page I shall send in to see Lord Byron .
Do not tell him before-hand , but , when he comes with flowers , shew him in .
I shall not come myself , unless just before he goes away  so do not think it is me .
Besides , you will see this is quite a child , only I wish him to see my Lord if you can contrive it , which , if you tell me what hour is most convenient , will be very easy .
I go out of Town to-morrow for a day or two , and I am now quite well -- at least much better . '' ]

-- To William Bankes .


April 20 , 1812 .


MY DEAR BANKES , -- I feel rather hurt ( not savagely ) at the speech you made to me last night , and my hope is that it was only one of your profane jests .
I should be very sorry that any part of my behaviour should give you cause to suppose that I think higher of myself , or otherwise of you than I have always done .
I can assure you that I am as much the humblest of your servants as at Trin .
Coll.  and if I have not been at home when you favoured me with a call , the loss was more mine than yours .
In the bustle of buzzing parties , there is , there can be , no rational conversation  but when I can enjoy it , there is nobody 's I can prefer to your own .


Believe me , ever faithfully and most affectionately yours ,


BYRON .

Friday noon .


I should have answered your note yesterday , but I hoped to have seen you this morning .
I must consult with you about the day we dine with Sir Francis [ 1 ] .
I suppose we shall meet at Lady Spencer 's [ 2 ] to-night .
I did not know that you were at Miss Berry 's [ 3 ] the other night , or I should have certainly gone there .


As usual , I am in all sorts of scrapes , though none , at present , of a martial description .


Believe me , etc. .

[ Footnote 3 : Mary Berry ( 1763-1852 ) , the friend and editor of Horace Walpole , whom she might have married , lived at Little Strawberry Hill , and in North Audley Street , London .
In her Journal Miss Berry mentions two occasions on which she met Byron .
The first was Thursday , April 2 , 1812 , at Lord Glenbervie 's .


`` I had a quarter of an hour 's conversation , which , I own , gave me a great desire to know him better , and he seemed willing that I should do so . ''


The second occasion was May 7 , 1812 .


`` At the end of the evening I had half an hour 's conversation with Lord Byron , principally on the subject of the Scotch Review , with which he is very much pleased .
He is a singular man , and pleasant to me but I very much fear that his head begins to be turned by all the adoration of the world , especially the women ''

235 .
-- To Lady Caroline Lamb .


May 1st , 1812 .


MY DEAR LADY CAROLINE,-I have read over the few poems of Miss Milbank [ 1 ] with attention .
They display fancy , feeling , and a little practice would very soon induce facility of expression .
Though I have an abhorrence of Blank Verse , I like the lines on Dermody [ 2 ] so much that I wish they were in rhyme .
The lines in the Cave at Seaham have a turn of thought which I can not sufficiently commend , and here I am at least candid as my own opinions differ upon such subjects .
The first stanza is very good indeed , and the others , with a few slight alterations , might be rendered equally excellent .
The last are smooth and pretty .
But these are all , has she no others ?
She certainly is a very extraordinary girl  who would imagine so much strength and variety of thought under that placid Countenance ?
It is not necessary for Miss M. to be an authoress , indeed I do not think publishing at all creditable either to men or women , and ( though you will not believe me ) very often feel ashamed of it myself  but I have no hesitation in saying that she has talents which , were it proper or requisite to indulge , would have led to distinction .


A friend of mine ( fifty years old , and an author , but not Rogers ) has just been here .
As there is no name to the MSS .
I shewed them to him , and he was much more enthusiastic in his praises than I have been .
He thinks them beautiful  I shall content myself with observing that they are better , much better , than anything of Miss M. 's protegee ( ` sic ' ) Blacket .
You will say as much of this to Miss M. as you think proper .
I say all this very sincerely .
I have no desire to be better acquainted with Miss Milbank  she is too good for a fallen spirit to know , and I should like her more if she were less perfect .
Believe me , yours ever most truly ,


B .


[ Footnote 1 : This letter refers to the future Lady Byron , the `` Miss Monmouth '' of ` Glenarvon ' ( see vol .
iii .
p. 100 ) , who was first brought to Byron 's notice by Lady Caroline Lamb .
Anna Isabella ( often shortened into Annabella ) Milbanke ( born May 17 , 1792  died May 16 , 1860 ) was the only child of Sir Ralph Milbanke , Bart. , and the Hon. Judith Noel , daughter of Lord Wentworth .
Her childhood was passed at Halnaby , or at Seaham , where her father had


`` a pretty villa on the cliff . ''
In 1808 Seaham `` was the most primitive hamlet ever met with -- a dozen or so of cottages , no trade , no manufacture , no business doing that we could see  the owners were mostly servants of Sir Ralph Milbanke 's ''


( ` Memoirs of a Highland Lady ' , p. 71 ) .
It was here that Blacket the poet ( see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 314 , ` note ' 2  p. 6 , ` note ' 5 , of the present volume  and ` English Bards , etc ' .
, line 770 , and Byron 's ` note ' ) died , befriended by Miss Milbanke .


Byron ( Medwin 's ` Conversations with Lord Byron ' , pp. 44 , 45 ) thus describes the personal appearance of his future wife :


`` There was something piquant and what we term pretty in Miss Milbanke .
Her features were small and feminine , though not regular .
She had the fairest skin imaginable .
Her figure was perfect for her height  and there was a simplicity , a retired modesty , about her , which was very characteristic , and formed a happy contrast to the cold , artificial formality and studied stiffness which is called fashion . ''


The roundness of her face suggested to Byron the pet name of `` Pippin . ''


High-principled , guided by a strong sense of duty , imbued with deep religious feeling , Miss Milbanke lived to impress F. W. Robertson as `` the noblest woman he ever knew '' ( ` Diary of Crabb Robinson ' ( 1852 ) , vol .
iii .
p. 405 ) .
She was also a clever , well-read girl , fond of mathematics , a student of theology and of Greek , a writer of meritorious verse , which , however , Byron only allowed to be `` good by accident '' ( Medwin , p. 60 ) .
Among her mother 's friends were Mrs. Siddons , Joanna Baillie , and Maria Edgeworth .
The latter , writing , May , 1813 , to Miss Ruxton , says , `` Lady Milbanke is very agreeable , and has a charming , well-informed daughter . ''
With all her personal charms , virtues , and mental gifts , she shows , in many of her letters , a precision , formality , and self-complacency , which suggest the female pedant .
Byron says of her that `` she was governed by what she called fixed rules and principles , squared mathematically '' ( Medwin , p. 60 )  at one time he used to speak of her as his `` Princess of Parallelograms , '' and at a later period he called her his `` Mathematical Medea . ''


Before Miss Milbanke met Byron , she had a lover in Augustus Foster , son of Lady Elizabeth Foster , afterwards Duchess of Devonshire .
The duchess , writing to her son , February 29 , 1812 , says that Mrs. George Lamb ( ? )
would sound Miss Milbanke as to her feelings :


`` Caro means to see ` la bella ' Annabelle before she writes to you ... I shall almost hate her if she is blind to the merits of one who would make her so happy ''


( ` The Two Duchesses ' , p. 358 ) .
Apparently Mr. Foster 's love was not returned .


`` She persists in saying , '' writes the duchess , May 4 , 1812 ( ` ibid ' .
, p. 362 ) , `` that she never suspected your attachment to her  but she is so odd a girl that , though she has for some time rather liked another , she has decidedly refused them , because she thinks she ought to marry a person with a good fortune  and this is partly , I believe , from generosity to her parents , and partly owning that fortune is an object to herself for happiness .
In short , she is good , amiable , and sensible , but cold , prudent , and reflecting .
Lord Byron makes up to her a little  but she do n't seem to admire him except as a poet , nor he her except for a wife . ''


Again , June 2 , 1812 , she says ,


`` Your Annabella is a mystery  liking , not liking  generous-minded , yet afraid of poverty  there is no making her out .
I hope you do n't make yourself unhappy about her  she is really an icicle . ''


Miss Milbanke 's unaffected simplicity attracted Byron  even her coldness was a charm .
When he came to know her , he probably found her not only agreeable , but the best woman he had ever met .
Lady Melbourne , who knew him most intimately , and was also Miss Milbanke 's aunt , may well have thought that , if her niece once gained control over Byron , her influence would be the making of his character .
She encouraged the match by every means in her power .
It is unnecessary to suppose that she did so to save Lady Caroline Lamb  that danger was over .
At some time before the autumn of 1812 , Byron proposed to Miss Milbanke , and was refused .
He still , however , continued to correspond with her , and his ` Journal ' shows that his affection for her was steadily growing during the years 1813-14 .
In September , 1814 , he proposed a second time , and was accepted .


Byron professed to believe ( Medwin , p. 59 ) that Miss Milbanke was not in love with him .


`` I was the fashion when she first came out  I had the character of being a great rake , and was a great dandy -- both of which young ladies like .
She married me from vanity , and the hope of reforming and fixing me . ''


Byron was not the man to unbosom himself to Medwin on such a subject .
Moore asked the same question -- whether Lady Byron really loved Byron -- of Lady Holland , who


`` seemed to think she must .
He was such a loveable person .
I remember him ( said she ) sitting there with that light upon him , looking so beautiful ! ' ''


( ` Journals , etc. ' , vol .
ii .
p. 324 ) .
The letters that will follow seem to show beyond all question that the marriage was one of true affection on both sides . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Thomas Dermody ( 1775-1802 ) , a precocious Irish lad , whose dissipated habits weakened his mind and body , published poems in 1792 , 1800 , and 1802 .

I am too proud of being your friend , to care with whom I am linked in your estimation , and , God knows , I want friends more at this time than at any other .
I am `` taking care of myself '' to no great purpose .
If you knew my situation in every point of view , you would excuse apparent and unintentional neglect .
I shall leave town , I think  but do not you leave it without seeing me .
I wish you , from my soul , every happiness you can wish yourself  and I think you have taken the road to secure it .
Peace be with you !
I fear she has abandoned me .

On Monday , after sitting up all night , I saw Bellingham launched into eternity [ 1 ] , and at three the same day I saw * * * launched into the country .


I believe , in the beginning of June , I shall be down for a few days in Notts .
If so , I shall beat you up ` en passant ' with Hobhouse , who is endeavouring , like you and every body else , to keep me out of scrapes .


I meant to have written you a long letter , but I find I can not .
If any thing remarkable occurs , you will hear it from me -- if good  if bad , there are plenty to tell it .
In the mean time , do you be happy .


Ever yours , etc. .


P.S. -- My best wishes and respects to Mrs. Moore  -- she is beautiful .
I may say so even to you , for I was never more struck with a countenance .


[ Footnote 1 : Bellingham , while engaged in the timber trade at Archangel , fancied himself wronged by the Russian Government , and the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg , Lord G. Leveson-Gower .
Returning to England , he set up in Liverpool as an insurance broker , continuing to press his claims against Russia on the Ministry without success .
On May 11 , 1812 , he shot Spencer Perceval , First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer , dead in the lobby of the House of Commons .
Bellingham was hanged before Newgate on May 18 .
Byron took a window , says Moore ( ` Life ' , p. 164 ) , to see the execution .
He


`` was accompanied on the occasion by his old schoolfellows , Mr. Bailey and Mr. John Madocks .
They went together from some assembly , and , on their arriving at the spot , about three o'clock in the morning , not finding the house that was to receive them open , Mr. Madocks undertook to rouse the inmates , while Lord Byron and Mr. Bailey sauntered , arm in arm , up the street .
During this interval , rather a painful scene occurred .
Seeing an unfortunate woman lying on the steps of a door , Lord Byron , with some expression of compassion , offered her a few shillings  but , instead of accepting them , she violently pushed away his hand , and , starting up with a yell of laughter , began to mimic the lameness of his gait .
He did not utter a word  but ' I could feel , ' said Mr. Bailey , ` his arm trembling within mine , as we left her . ' ''


In Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' is an anecdote of Baillie , whose name is here misspelt by Moore :


`` Baillie ( commonly called ` Long ' Baillie , a very clever man , but odd ) complained in riding , to our friend Scrope Davies , that he had a ` stitch ' in his side . '
I do n't wonder at it , ' said Scrope , ` for you ride like a tailor . '
Whoever has seen B. on horseback , with his very tall figure on a small nag , would not deny the justice of the repartee . '' ]

8 , St. James 's St. , June 1 , 1812 .


The most satisfactory answer to the concluding part of your letter is that Mr. Murray will republish your volume , if you still retain your inclination for the experiment , which I trust will be successful .
Some weeks ago my friend Mr. Rogers showed me some of the stanzas in MS. , and I then expressed my opinion of their merit , which a further perusal of the printed volume has given me no reason to revoke .
I mention this , as it may not be disagreeable to you to learn that I entertained a very favourable opinion of your powers , before I was aware that such sentiments were reciprocal .


Waiving your obliging expressions as to my own productions , for which I thank you very sincerely , and assure you that I think not lightly of the praise of one whose approbation is valuable , will you allow me to talk to you candidly , not critically , on the subject of yours ?
You will not suspect me of a wish to discourage , since I pointed out to the publisher the propriety of complying with your wishes .
I think more highly of your poetical talents than it would , perhaps , gratify you to hear expressed , for I believe , from what I observe of your mind , that you are above flattery .
To come to the point , you deserve success , but we know , before Addison wrote his Cato ' , that desert does not always command it .
But , suppose it attained :


`` You know what ills the author 's life assail , Toil , envy , want , the patron and the jail . ''
[ 2 ]


Do not renounce writing , but never trust entirely to authorship .
If you have a possession , retain it  it will be , like Prior 's fellowship [ 3 ] , a last and sure resource .
Compare Mr. Rogers with other authors of the day  assuredly he is amongst the first of living poets , but is it to that he owes his station in society , and his intimacy in the best circles ?
No , it is to his prudence and respectability  the world ( a bad one , I own ) courts him because he has no occasion to court it .
He is a poet , nor is he less so because he was something more .
I am not sorry to hear that you are not tempted by the vicinity of Capel Loft , Esq 're .
[ 4 ] , though , if he had done for you what he has done for the Bloomfields , I should never have laughed at his rage for patronising .
But a truly constituted mind will ever be independent .
That you may be so is my sincere wish , and , if others think as well of your poetry as I do , you will have no cause to complain of your readers .


Believe me , etc. .

-- To Lord Holland .


June 25 , 1812 .


MY DEAR LORD , -- I must appear very ungrateful , and have , indeed , been very negligent , but till last night I was not apprised of Lady Holland 's restoration , and I shall call to-morrow to have the satisfaction , I trust , of hearing that she is well .
-- I hope that neither politics nor gout have assailed your Lordship since I last saw you , and that you also are `` as well as could be expected . ''


The other night , at a ball , I was presented by order to our gracious Regent , who honoured me with some conversation , and professed a predilection for poetry [ 1 ] .
-- I confess it was a most unexpected honour , and I thought of poor Brummell 's [ 2 ] adventure , with some apprehension of a similar blunder .
I have now great hope , in the event of Mr. Pye 's [ 3 ] decease , of `` warbling truth at court , '' like Mr. Mallet [ 4 ] of indifferent memory .
-- Consider , one hundred marks a year !
besides the wine and the disgrace  but then remorse would make me drown myself in my own butt before the year 's end , or the finishing of my first dithyrambic .
-- So that , after all , I shall not meditate our laureate 's death by pen or poison .


Will you present my best respects to Lady Holland ?
and believe me , hers and yours very sincerely .


[ Footnote 1 : The ball was given in June , 1812 , at Miss Johnson 's ( see ` Memoir of John Murray ' , vol .
i. p. 212 ) .
In the words `` predilection for poetry '' Byron probably refers to the phrase in the Regent 's letter to the Duke of York ( February 13 , 1812 ) : `` I have no predilections to indulge , no resentments to gratify . ''
Moore , in the ` Twopenny Post-bag ' , twice fastens on the phrase .
In `` The Insurrection of the Papers '' , a dream suggested by Lord Castlereagh 's speech -- `` It would be impossible for His Royal Highness to disengage his person from the accumulating pile of papers that encompassed it '' -- he writes :


`` But , oh , the basest of defections !
His Letter about ` predilections ' -- His own dear Letter , void of grace , Now flew up in its parent 's face ! ''


And again , in the `` Parody of a Celebrated Letter '' :


`` I am proud to declare I have no predilections , My heart is a sieve , where some scatter'd affections Are just danc'd about for a moment or two , And the ` finer ' they are , the more sure to run through . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : The grandfather of Beau Brummell , who was in business in Bury Street , St. James 's , also let lodgings .
One of his lodgers , Charles Jenkinson , afterwards Earl of Liverpool , obtained for his landlord 's son , William Brummell , a clerkship in the Treasury .
The Treasury clerk became so useful to Lord North that he obtained several lucrative offices  and , dying in 1794 , left L65 ,000 in the hands of trustees for division among his three children .
The youngest of these was George Bryan Brummell ( 1788-1840 ) , the celebrated Beau .


George Brummell went from Eton to Oriel College , Oxford , where his undergraduate career is traced in `` Trebeck , '' a character in Lister 's ` Granby ' ( 1826 ) .
From Oxford Brummell entered the Tenth Hussars , a favourite regiment of the Prince of Wales .
Well-built and well-mannered , possessed of admirable tact , witty and original in conversation , inexhaustible in good temper and good stories , a master of impudence and banter , the new cornet made himself so agreeable to the prince that , at the latter 's marriage , Brummell attended him , both at St. James 's and to Windsor , as `` a kind of ` chevalier d'honneur . ''
In 1798 Brummell left the army with the rank of captain .
A year later he came of age , and settled at 4 , Chesterfield Street , Mayfair .


On his intimacy with the Prince Regent , Brummell founded the extraordinary position which he achieved in society .
Fashion was in those days a power  and he was its dictator -- the oracle , both for men and women , of taste , manners , and dress .
His ascendency rested in some degree on solid foundations .
He was not a mere fop , but conspicuous for the quiet neatness of his dress -- for `` a certain exquisite propriety , '' as Byron described it to Leigh Hunt -- and , at a time when the opposite was common , for the scrupulous cleanliness of his person and his linen .
An excellent dancer , clever at ` vers de societe ' , an agreeable singer , a talented artist , a judge of china , buhl , and other objects of ` virtu ' , a collector of snuff-boxes , a connoisseur in canes , he had gifts which might have raised him above the Bond Street ` flaneur ' , or the idler at Watier 's Club .
Well-read in a desultory fashion , he wrote verses which were not without merit in their class .
The following are the first and last stanzas of ` The Butterfly 's Funeral ' , a poem which was suggested by Mrs. Dorset 's ` Peacock at Home ' and Roscoe 's ` Butterfly 's Ball ' : --


`` Oh ye !
who so lately were blythsome and gay , At the Butterfly 's banquet carousing away  Your feasts and your revels of pleasure are fled , For the soul of the banquet , the Butterfly 's dead !
* * * * * And here shall the daisy and violet blow , And the lily discover her bosom of snow  While under the leaf , in the evenings of spring , Still mourning his friend , shall the grasshopper sing . ''


In the days of his prosperity ( 1799-1816 ) , Brummell knew everybody to whose acquaintance he condescended .
His Album , in which he collected 226 pieces of poetry , many by himself , others by celebrities of the day , is a curious proof of his popularity .
It contains contributions from such persons as the Duchess of Devonshire , Erskine , Lord John Townshend , Sheridan , General Fitzpatrick , William Lamb ( afterwards Lord Melbourne ) and his brother George , and Byron .
Lady Hester Stanhope ( ` Memoirs ' , vol .
i. pp. 280-283 ) knew him well .
She describes him `` riding in Bond Street , with his bridle between his fore-finger and thumb , as if he held a pinch of snuff  '' gives many instances of his audacious effrontery , and yet concludes that `` the man was no fool , '' and that she `` should like to see him again . ''


The story that Brummell told the Prince Regent to ring the bell was denied by him .
A more probable version of the story is given in Jesse 's ` Life of Beau Brummell ' ( vol .
i. p. 255 ) ,


`` that one evening , when Brummell and Lord Moira were engaged in earnest conversation at Carlton House , the prince requested the former to ring the bell , and that he replied without reflection , ` Your Royal Highness is close to it , ' upon which the prince rang the bell and ordered his friend 's carriage , but that Lord Moira 's intervention caused the unintentional liberty to be overlooked . ''


The rupture between them is attributed by Jesse to Mrs. Fitzherbert 's influence .
Whatever the cause , the prince cut his former friend .
A short time afterwards , Brummell , walking with Lord Alvanley , met the prince leaning on the arm of Lord Moira .
As the prince , who stopped to speak to Lord Alvanley , was moving on , Brummell said to his companion , `` Alvanley , who 's your fat friend ? ''
In the ` Twopenny Postbag ' Moore makes the Regent say , in the `` Parody of a Celebrated Letter '' :


`` Neither have I resentments , or wish there should come ill To mortal -- except , now I think on it , Beau Brummell , Who threatened last year , in a superfine passion , To cut me , and bring the old king into fashion . ''


Brummell 's position withstood the loss of the Regent 's friendship .
He became one of the most frequent visitors to the Duke and Duchess of York , at Oatlands Park ( ` Journal of T. Raikes ' , vol .
i. p. 146 )  and his friendship with the duchess lasted till her death .


He was ruined by gambling at Watier 's Club , of which he was perpetual president .
This club , which was in Piccadilly , at the corner of Bolton Street , was originally founded , in 1807 , by Lord Headfort , John Madocks , and other young men , for musical gatherings .
But glees and snatches soon gave way to superlative dinners and gambling at macao .
Byron , Moore , and William Spencer belonged to Watier 's -- the only men of letters admitted within its precincts .
From 1814 to 1816 Brummell lost heavily  he could obtain no further supplies , and was completely ruined .
In his distress he wrote to Scrope Davies , in May , 1816 :


`` MY DEAR SCROPE , -- Lend me two hundred pounds  the banks are shut , and all my money is in the three per cents .
It shall be repaid to-morrow morning .


Yours , GEORGE BRUMMELL . ''


The reply illustrates Byron 's remark that


`` Scrope Davies is a wit , and a man of the world , and feels as much as such a character can do . ''


`` MY DEAR GEORGE , -- 'T is very unfortunate , but all my money is in the three per cents .


Yours , S. DAVIES . ''


On May 17 ,


`` obliged , '' says Byron ( ` Detached Thoughts ' ) , `` by that affair of poor Meyler , who thence acquired the name of ` Dick the Dandykiller ' -- ( it was about money and debt and all that ) -- to retire to France , ''


Brummell took flight to Dover , and crossed to Calais .
Watier 's Club died a natural death , in 1819 , from the ruin of most of its members .


Amongst Brummell 's effects at Chesterfield Street was a screen which he was making for the Duchess of York .
The sixth panel was occupied by Byron and Napoleon , placed opposite each other  the former , surrounded with flowers , had a wasp in his throat ( Jesse 's ` Life ' , vol .
i. p. 361 ) .
At Calais Brummell bought a French grammar to study the language .
When Scrope Davies was asked , says Byron ( ` Detached Thoughts ' ) ,


`` what progress Brummell had made in French , he responded ` that Brummell had been stopped , like Buonaparte in Russia , by the ` Elements '' I have put this pun into ` Beppo ' , which is ' a fair exchange and no robbery  ' for Scrope made his fortune at several dinners ( as he owned himself ) by repeating occasionally as his own some of the buffooneries with which I had encountered him in the morning . ''


Brummell died , in 1840 , at Caen , after making acquaintance with the inside of the debtor 's prison in that town -- imbecile , and in the asylum of the ` Bon Sauveur ' .
He is buried in the Protestant cemetery of Caen .
France has raised a more lasting monument to his fame in Barbey d'Aurevilly 's ` Du Dandysme et de Georges Brummell ' ( 1845 ) . ]


[ Footnote 3 : Henry James Pye ( 1745-1813 ) was , from 1790 to his death , poet laureate , in which post he succeeded Thomas Warton , and was followed by Southey .
Mathias , in the ` Pursuits of Literature ' ( Dialogue ii .
lines 69 , 70 ) , says :


`` With Spartan Pye lull England to repose , Or frighten children with Lenora 's woes  ''


and again ( ` ibid ' .
, lines 79 , 80 ) :


`` Why should I faint when all with patience hear , And laureat Pye sings more than twice a year ? ''


His birthday odes were so full of `` vocal groves and feathered choirs , '' that George Steevens broke out with the lines :


`` When the ` pie ' was opened , '' etc. .


Pye 's ` magnum opus ' was ` Alfred ' ( 1801 ) , an epic poem in six books . ]


[ Footnote 4 : David Mallet , or Malloch ( 1705-1765 ) , is best known for his ballad of ` William and Margaret ' , his unsubstantiated claim to the authorship of ` Rule , Britannia ' , and his edition of Bolingbroke 's works .
He was appointed , in 1742 , under-secretary to Frederick , Prince of Wales . ]

-- To Professor Clarke [ 1 ] .


St. James 's Street , June 26 , 1812 .


Will you accept my very sincere congratulations on your second volume , wherein I have retraced some of my old paths , adorned by you so beautifully , that they afford me double delight ?
The part which pleases me best , after all , is the preface , because it tells me you have not yet closed labours , to yourself not unprofitable , nor without gratification , for what is so pleasing as to give pleasure ?
I have sent my copy to Sir Sidney Smith , who will derive much gratification from your anecdotes of Djezzar , [ 1 ] his `` energetic old man . ''
I doat upon the Druses  but who the deuce are they with their Pantheism ?
I shall never be easy till I ask them the question .
How much you have traversed !
I must resume my seven leagued boots and journey to Palestine , which your description mortifies me not to have seen more than ever .
I still sigh for the AEgean .
Shall not you always love its bluest of all waves , and brightest of all skies ?
You have awakened all the gipsy in me .
I long to be restless again , and wandering  see what mischief you do , you wo n't allow gentlemen to settle quietly at home .
I will not wish you success and fame , for you have both , but all the happiness which even these can not always give .


[ Footnote 1 : Edward Daniel Clarke ( 1769-1822 ) , appointed Professor of Mineralogy at Cambridge , in 1808 , was the rival whose travels Hobhouse was anxious to anticipate .
He is described by Miss Edgeworth , in 1813 ( ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 205 ) , as


`` a little , square , pale , flat-faced , good-natured-looking , fussy man , with very intelligent eyes , yet great credulity of countenance , and still greater benevolence . ''


Byron met Clarke at Cambridge in November , 1811 , discussed Greece with him , and was relieved to find that he knew `` no Romaic . ''
Clarke was an indefatigable traveller , and , as he was a botanist , mineralogist , antiquary , and numismatist , he made good use of his opportunities .
The marbles , including the Eleusinian Ceres , which he brought home , are in the Fitzwilliam Museum .
His mineralogical collections were purchased , after his death , by the University of Cambridge  and his coins by Payne Knight .
His ` Travels in Various Countries of Europe , Asia , and Africa ' appeared at intervals , from 1810 to 1823 , in six quarto volumes .
The following letter was written by Clarke to Byron , after the appearance of ` Childe Harold ' :


`` Trumpington , Wednesday morning .


`` DEAR LORD BYRON , -- From the eagerness which I felt to make known my opinions of your poem before others had expressed any upon the subject , I waited upon you to deliver my hasty , although hearty , commendation .
If it be worthy your acceptance , take it once more , in a more deliberate form !
Upon my arrival in town I found that Mathias entirely coincided with me .
` Surely , ' said I to him , ` Lord Byron , at this time of life , can not have experienced such keen anguish as those exquisite allusions to what older men may have felt seem to denote ! '
This was his answer : ' I fear he has -- he could not else have written such a poem . '
This morning I read the second canto with all the attention it so highly merits , in the peace and stillness of my study  and I am ready to confess I was never so much affected by any poem , passionately fond of poetry as I have been from my earliest youth ...


`` The eighth stanza , ` Yet if as holiest men , ' etc. , has never been surpassed .
In the twenty-third , the sentiment is at variance with Dryden :


` Strange cozenage !
none would live past years again . '


`` And it is perhaps an instance wherein , for the first time , I found not within my own breast an echo to your thought , for I would not ` be once more a boy  ' but the generality of men will agree with you , and wish to tread life 's path again .


`` In the twelfth stanza of the same canto , you might really add a very curious note to these lines :


` Her sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard , Yet felt some portion of their mother 's pains , '


`` by stating this fact : When the last of the Metopes was taken from the Parthenon , and , in moving it , a great part of the superstructure with one of the triglyphs , was thrown down by the work men whom Lord Elgin employed , the Disdar , who beheld the mischief done to the building , took his pipe out of his mouth , dropped a tear , and , in a supplicating tone of voice , said to Lusieri -- [ Greek : Telos ] !
I was present at the time .


`` Once more I thank you for the gratification you have afforded me .


`` Believe me , ever yours most truly , `` E. D. CLARKE . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : In Clarke 's ` Travels ' ( Part II .
sect .
i. chap , xii. , `` Greece , Egypt , and the Holy Land '' ) will be found an account of Djezzar Pasha , who fortified Acre in 1775 , and with Sir Sidney Smith , defended it against Buonaparte , March 16 to May 20 , 1799 .
Clarke ( ` ibid ' . )
mentions the Druses detained by Djezzar as hostages . ]

-- To Walter Scott .
[ 1 ]


St. James 's Street , July 6 , 1812 .


SIR , -- I have just been honoured with your letter .
-- I feel sorry that you should have thought it worth while to notice the `` evil works of my nonage , '' as the thing is suppressed voluntarily , and your explanation is too kind not to give me pain .
The Satire was written when I was very young and very angry , and fully bent on displaying my wrath and my wit , and now I am haunted by the ghosts of my wholesale assertions .
I can not sufficiently thank you for your praise  and now , waving myself , let me talk to you of the Prince Regent .
He ordered me to be presented to him at a ball  and after some sayings peculiarly pleasing from royal lips , as to my own attempts , he talked to me of you and your immortalities : he preferred you to every bard past and present , and asked which of your works pleased me most .
It was a difficult question .
I answered , I thought the ` Lay ' .
He said his own opinion was nearly similar .
In speaking of the others , I told him that I thought you more particularly the poet of Princes , as they never appeared more fascinating than in ` Marmion ' and the ` Lady of the Lake ' .
He was pleased to coincide , and to dwell on the description of your Jameses as no less royal than poetical .
He spoke alternately of Homer and yourself , and seemed well acquainted with both  so that ( with the exception of the Turks [ 2 ] and your humble servant ) you were in very good company .
I defy Murray to have exaggerated his Royal Highness 's opinion of your powers , nor can I pretend to enumerate all he said on the subject  but it may give you pleasure to hear that it was conveyed in language which would only suffer by my attempting to transcribe it , and with a tone and taste which gave me a very high idea of his abilities and accomplishments , which I had hitherto considered as confined to manners , certainly superior to those of any living gentleman [ 3 ] .


This interview was accidental .
I never went to the levee  for having seen the courts of Mussulman and Catholic sovereigns , my curiosity was sufficiently allayed  and my politics being as perverse as my rhymes , I had , in fact , `` no business there . ''
To be thus praised by your Sovereign must be gratifying to you  and if that gratification is not alloyed by the communication being made through me , the bearer of it will consider himself very fortunately and sincerely ,


Your obliged and obedient servant ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- Excuse this scrawl , scratched in a great hurry , and just after a journey .


[ Footnote 1 : The correspondence which begins with this letter laid the foundation of a firm friendship between the two poets .
Scott was naturally annoyed by the attack upon him in ` English Bards , etc ' .
( lines 171-174 ) , made by `` a young whelp of a Lord Byron . ''
Though ` Childe Harold ' seemed to him `` a clever poem , '' it did not raise his opinion of Byron 's character .
Murray , hoping to heal the breach between them , wrote to Scott , June 27 , 1812 ( ` Memoir of John Murray ' , vol .
i. p. 213 ) , giving Byron 's account of the conversation with the Prince Regent .


`` But the Prince 's great delight , '' says Murray , `` was Walter Scott , whose name and writings he dwelt upon and recurred to incessantly .
He preferred him far beyond any other poet of the time , repeated several passages with fervour , and criticized them faithfully ... Lord Byron called upon me , merely to let off the raptures of the Prince respecting you , thinking , as he said , that if I were likely to have occasion to write to you , it might not be ungrateful for you to hear of his praises . ''


Scott 's answer ( July 2 ) enclosed the following letter from himself to Byron :


`` Edinburgh , July 3d , 1812 .


`` MY LORD , -- I am uncertain if I ought to profit by the apology which is afforded me , by a very obliging communication from our acquaintance , John Murray , of Fleet Street , to give your Lordship the present trouble .
But my intrusion concerns a large debt of gratitude due to your Lordship , and a much less important one of explanation , which I think I owe to myself , as I dislike standing low in the opinion of any person whose talents rank so highly in my own , as your Lordship 's most deservedly do .


`` The first ` count ' , as our technical language expresses it , relates to the high pleasure I have received from the ` Pilgrimage of Childe Harold ' , and from its precursors  the former , with all its classical associations , some of which are lost on so poor a scholar as I am , possesses the additional charm of vivid and animated description , mingled with original sentiment  but besides this debt , which I owe your Lordship in common with the rest of the reading public , I have to acknowledge my particular thanks for your having distinguished by praise , in the work which your Lordship rather dedicated in general to satire , some of my own literary attempts .
And this leads me to put your Lordship right in the circumstances respecting the sale of ` Marmion ' , which had reached you in a distorted and misrepresented form , and which , perhaps , I have some reason to complain , were given to the public without more particular inquiry .
The poem , my Lord , was not written upon contract for a sum of money -- though it is too true that it was sold and published in a very unfinished state ( which I have since regretted ) , to enable me to extricate myself from some engagements which fell suddenly upon me by the unexpected misfortunes of a very near relation .
So that , to quote statute and precedent , I really come under the case cited by Juvenal , though not quite in the extremity of the classic author :


` Esurit , intactam Paridi nisi vendit Agaven . '


`` And so much for a mistake , into which your Lordship might easily fall , especially as I generally find it the easiest way of stopping sentimental compliments on the beauty , etc. , of certain poetry , and the delights which the author must have taken in the composition , by assigning the readiest reason that will cut the discourse short , upon a subject where one must appear either conceited or affectedly rude and cynical .


`` As for my attachment to literature , I sacrificed for the pleasure of pursuing it very fair chances of opulence and professional honours , at a time of life when I fully knew their value  and I am not ashamed to say , that in deriving advantages in compensation from the partial favour of the public , I have added some comforts and elegancies to a bare independence .
I am sure your Lordship 's good sense will easily put this unimportant egotism to the right account , for -- though I do not know the motive would make me enter into controversy with a fair or an ` unfair ' literary critic -- I may be well excused for a wish to clear my personal character from any tinge of mercenary or sordid feeling in the eyes of a contemporary of genius .
Your Lordship will likewise permit me to add that you would have escaped the trouble of this explanation , had I not understood that the satire alluded to had been suppressed , not to be reprinted .
For in removing a prejudice on your Lordship 's own mind , I had no intention of making any appeal by or through you to the public , since my own habits of life have rendered my defence as to avarice or rapacity rather too easy .


`` Leaving this foolish matter where it lies , I have to request your Lordship 's acceptance of my best thanks for the flattering communication which you took the trouble to make Mr. Murray on my behalf , and which could not fail to give me the gratification which I am sure you intended .
I dare say our worthy bibliopolist overcoloured his report of your Lordship 's conversation with the Prince Regent , but I owe my thanks to him nevertheless , for the excuse he has given me for intruding these pages on your Lordship .
Wishing you health , spirit , and perseverance , to continue your pilgrimage through the interesting countries which you have still to pass with ` Childe Harold ' , I have the honour to be , my Lord ,


`` Your Lordship 's obedient servant ,


`` WALTER SCOTT .


`` P.S. -- Will your Lordship permit me a verbal criticism on ` Childe Harold ' , were it only to show I have read his Pilgrimage with attention ?
` Nuestra Dama de la Pena ' means , I suspect , not our Lady of Crime or Punishment , but our Lady of the Cliff  the difference is , I believe , merely in the accentuation of ` pena ' . ''


To Scott Byron replied with the letter given in the text .
Scott 's answer , which followed in due course , will be found in Appendix V .


The Prince Regent , it may be added , showed his appreciation of Scott 's poetry by offering him , on the death of Pye , the post of poet laureate .
Scott refused , on the ground , apparently , that the office had been made ridiculous by the previous holder .


`` At the time when Scott and Byron were the two ` lions ' of London , Hookham Frere observed , ` Great poets formerly ( Homer and Milton ) were blind  now they are lame ' ''


( ` Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers ' , P. 194 ) . ]


[ Footnote 2 : The Turkish ambassador and suite were at the ball . ]


[ Footnote 3 : Byron had already written his `` Stanzas to a Lady Weeping , '' suggested by the rumour that Princess Charlotte had burst into tears , on being told that there would be no change of Ministry when the Prince of Wales assumed the Regency .
They appeared anonymously in the ` Morning Chronicle ' for March 7 , 1812 , under the title of a `` Sympathetic ` Address ' to a Young Lady . ''
They were published , as Byron 's work , with ` The Corsair ' , in February , 1814 .
The verses rather betray the influence of Moore than express his own feelings at the time .
In ` Don Juan ' ( Canto XII .
stanza lxxxiv . )
he thus speaks of the Regent :


`` There , too , he saw ( whate'er he may be now ) A Prince , the prince of princes at the time , With fascination in his very bow , And full of promise , as the spring of prime .
Though royalty was written on his brow , He had ` then ' the grace , too , rare in every clime , Of being , without alloy of fop or beau , A finish'd gentleman from top to toe . ''


Dallas found him , shortly after his introduction to the prince , `` in a full-dress court suit of clothes , with his fine black hair in powder , '' prepared to attend a levee .
But the levee was put off , and the subsequent avowal of the authorship of the stanzas rendered it impossible for him to go ( ` Recollections ' , p. 234 ) . ]

-- To Lady Caroline Lamb .


[ August , 1812 ? ]


MY DEAREST CAROLINE , [ 1 ] -- If tears which you saw and know I am not apt to shed , -- if the agitation in which I parted from you , -- agitation which you must have perceived through the whole of this most nervous affair , did not commence until the moment of leaving you approached , -- if all I have said and done , and am still but too ready to say and do , have not sufficiently proved what my real feelings are , and must ever be towards you , my love , I have no other proof to offer .
God knows , I wish you happy , and when I quit you , or rather you , from a sense of duty to your husband and mother , quit me , you shall acknowledge the truth of what I again promise and vow , that no other in word or deed , shall ever hold the place in my affections , which is , and shall be , most sacred to you , till I am nothing .
I never knew till that moment the madness of my dearest and most beloved friend  I can not express myself  this is no time for words , but I shall have a pride , a melancholy pleasure , in suffering what you yourself can scarcely conceive , for you do not know me .
I am about to go out with a heavy heart , because my appearing this evening will stop any absurd story which the event of the day might give rise to .
Do you think now I am cold and stern and artful ?
Will even others think so ?
Will your mother ever -- that mother to whom we must indeed sacrifice much , more , much more on my part than she shall ever know or can imagine ?
`` Promise not to love you ! ''
ah , Caroline , it is past promising .
But I shall attribute all concessions to the proper motive , and never cease to feel all that you have already witnessed , and more than can ever be known but to my own heart , -- perhaps to yours .
May God protect , forgive , and bless you .
Ever , and even more than ever ,


Your most attached ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- These taunts which have driven you to this , my dearest Caroline , were it not for your mother and the kindness of your connections , is there anything on earth or heaven that would have made me so happy as to have made you mine long ago ?
and not less now than then , but more than ever at this time .
You know I would with pleasure give up all here and all beyond the grave for you , and in refraining from this , must my motives be misunderstood ?
I care not who knows this , what use is made of it , -- it is to you and to you only that they are yourself ( sic ) .
I was and am yours freely and most entirely , to obey , to honour , love , -- and fly with you when , where , and how you yourself might and may determine .


[ Footnote 1 : Lady Caroline 's infatuation for Byron , expressed in various ways -- once ( in July , 1813 ) by a self-inflicted stab with a table-knife , or a broken glass -- became the talk of society .


`` Your little friend , Caro William , '' writes the Duchess of Devonshire , May 4 , 1812 , `` as usual , is doing all sorts of imprudent things for him and with him . ''


Again she writes , six days later , of Byron :


`` The ladies , I hear , spoil him , and the gentlemen are jealous of him .
He is going back to Naxos , and then the husbands may sleep in peace .
I should not be surprised if Caro William were to go with him , she is so wild and imprudent ''


( The ` Two Duchesses ' , pp. 362 , 364 ) .
But Lady Caroline 's extravagant adoration wearied Byron , who felt that it made him ridiculous  Lady Melbourne gave him sound advice about her daughter-in-law  and he was growing attached to Miss Milbanke , and , when rejected by her , at first to Lady Oxford , and later to Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster .
When Lady Bessborough endeavoured to persuade her daughter to leave London for Ireland , Lady Caroline is said to have forced herself into Byron 's room , and implored him to fly with her .
Byron refused , conducted her back to Melbourne House , wrote her the letter printed above , and , as she herself admits , kept the secret .
In December , 1812 , Lady Caroline burned Byron in effigy , with `` his book , ring , and chain , '' at Brocket Hall .
The lines which she wrote for the ceremony are preserved in Mrs. Leigh 's handwriting , and given in Appendix III. , 2 .


From Ireland Lady Caroline continued the siege , threatening to follow him into Herefordshire , demanding interviews , and writing about him to Lady Oxford .
At length Byron sent her the letter , probably in November , 1812 , which she professes to publish in ` Glenarvon ' ( vol .
iii .
chap .
ix . ) .
The words are acknowledged by Byron to have formed part at least of the real document , which is here quoted as printed in the novel :


`` Mortanville Priory , November the 9th .


`` LADY AVONDALE , -- I am no longer your lover  and since you oblige me to confess it , by this truly unfeminine persecution , ... learn , that I am attached to another  whose name it would , of course , be dishonourable to mention .
I shall ever remember with gratitude the many instances I have received of the predilection you have shown in my favour .
I shall ever continue your friend , if your ladyship will permit me so to style myself  and , as a first proof of my regard , I offer you this advice , correct your vanity , which is ridiculous  exert your absurd caprices upon others  and leave me in peace .


`` Your most obedient servant ,


`` GLENARVON . ''


The first effect of this letter and her unrequited passion was , as she told Lady Morgan , to deprive her temporarily of reason , and it may be added that , when she was a child , her grandmother was so alarmed by her eccentricities as to consult a doctor on the state of her mind .
The second effect was to render her temper so ungovernable that William Lamb decided on a separation .
All preliminaries were arranged  the solicitor arrived with the documents  but the old charm reasserted itself , and she was found seated by her husband , `` feeding him with tiny scraps of transparent bread and butter '' ( Torrens , ` Memoirs of Lord Melbourne ' , vol .
i. p. 112 ) .
The separation did not take place till 1825 .


Throughout 1812-14 Lady Caroline continued to write to Byron , at first asking for interviews .
Two of her last letters to him , written apparently on the eve of his leaving England , in 1816 , are worth printing , though they increase the mystery of ` Glenarvon ' .
( See Appendix III. , 4 and 5 . )


In Isaac Nathan 's ` Fugitive Pieces ' ( 1829 ) , a section is devoted to `` Poetical Effusions , Letters , Anecdotes , and Recollections of Lady Caroline Lamb . ''


Lady Caroline wrote three novels : ` Glenarvon ' ( 1816 )  ` Graham Hamilton ' ( 1822 )  and ` Ada Reis  a Tale ' ( 1823 ) .
` Glenarvon ' , apart from its biographical interest , is unreadable .


`` I do not know , '' writes C. Lemon to Lady H. Frampton ( ` Journal of Mary Frampton ' , pp. 286 , 287 ) , `` all the characters in ` Glenarvon ' , but I will tell you all I do know .
I am not surprised at your being struck with a few detached passages  but before you have read one volume , I think you will doubt at which end of the book you began .
There is no connection between any two ideas in the book , and it seems to me to have been written as the sages of Laputa composed their works .
` Glenarvon ' is Lord Byron  ` Lady Augusta , ' the late Duchess of Devonshire  ` Lady Mandeville ' -- I think it is Lady Mandeville , but the lady who dictated Glearvon 's farewell letter to Calantha -- is Lady Oxford .
This letter she really dictated to Lord Byron to send to Lady Caroline Lamb , and is now very much offended that she has treated the matter so lightly as to introduce it into her book .
The best character in it is the ` Princess of Madagascar ' ( Lady Holland ) , with all her Reviewers about her .
The young Duke of Devonshire is in the book , but I forget under what name .
I need not say that the heroine is Lady Caroline 's own self . ''


In July , 1824 , she was out riding , when she accidentally met Byron 's funeral on its way to Newstead .
`` I am sure , '' she wrote to Murray , July 13 , 1824 , `` I am very sorry I ever said one unkind word against him . ''
Her mind never recovered the shock , and she died in January , 1828 , in the presence of her husband , at Melbourne House .

-- To John Murray .


High Street , Cheltenham , Sept. 5 , 1812 .


DEAR SIR , -- Pray have the goodness to send those despatches , and a No .
of the E.R. with the rest .
I hope you have written to Mr. Thompson , thanked him in my name for his present , and told him that I shall be truly happy to comply with his request .
-- How do you go on ?
and when is the graven image , `` with bays and wicked rhyme upo n't , '' to grace , or disgrace , some of our tardy editions ?


Send me `` Rokeby '' [ 1 ] who the deuce is he ?
-- no matter , he has good connections , and will be well introduced .
I thank you for your inquiries : I am so so , but my thermometer is sadly below the poetical point .
What will you give me or mine for a poem [ 2 ] of six cantos , ( when complete -- no rhyme , no recompense , ) as like the last two as I can make them ?
I have some ideas which one day may be embodied , and till winter I shall have much leisure .


Believe me , yours very sincerely ,


BYRON .


P. S. -- My last question is in the true style of Grub Street  but , like Jeremy Diddler [ 3 ] , I only `` ask for information . ''
-- Send me Adair on Diet and Regimen , just republished by Ridgway [ 4 ] .


[ Footnote 1 : ` Rokeby ' , completed December 31 , 1812 , was published in the following year , with a dedication to John Morritt , to whom Rokeby belonged .
It was , as Scott admits in the Preface to the edition of 1830 , comparatively a failure .
In the popularity of Byron he finds the chief cause of the small success which his poem obtained .


`` To have kept his ground at the crisis when ` Rokeby ' appeared , '' he writes , `` its author ought to have put forth his utmost strength , and to have possessed all his original advantages , for a mighty and unexpected rival was advancing on the stage -- a rival not in poetical powers only , but in that art of attracting popularity , in which the present writer had hitherto preceded better men than himself .
The reader will easily see that Byron is here meant , who , after a little velitation of no great promise , now appeared as a serious candidate , in the first two cantos of ` Childe Harold ' . ''


On this rivalry Byron wrote the passage in his Diary for November 17 , 1813 .
A further cause for the cold reception of ` Rokeby ' was its inferiority both to the ` Lay ' and to ` Marmion ' .
In Letter vii .
of the ` Twopenny Post-bag ' , Moore writes thus of ` Rokeby '


`` Should you feel any touch of ` poetical ' glow , We 've a Scheme to suggest -- Mr. Sc -- tt , you must know , ( Who , we 're sorry to say it , now works for the ` Row ' ) Having quitted the Borders , to seek new renown , Is coming by long Quarto stages , to Town  And beginning with Rokeby ( the job 's sure to pay ) Means to ` do ' all the Gentlemen 's Seats on the way .
Now the Scheme is ( though none of our hackneys can beat him ) To start a fresh Poet through Highgate to ` meet ' him  Who , by means of quick proofs -- no revises -- long coaches -- May do a few Villas before Sc -- tt approaches -- Indeed , if our Pegasus be not curst shabby , He 'll reach , without found ` ring , at least Woburn Abbey .

Cheltenham , September 10 , 1812 .


My Dear Lord , -- The lines which I sketched off on your hint are still , or rather were , in an unfinished state , for I have just committed them to a flame more decisive than that of Drury [ 1 ] .


Under all circumstances , I should hardly wish a contest with Philodrama -- Philo-Drury -- Asbestos , H -- , and all the anonymes and synonymes of Committee candidates .
Seriously , I think you have a chance of something much better  for prologuising is not my forte , and , at all events , either my pride or my modesty wo n't let me incur the hazard of having my rhymes buried in next month 's Magazine , under `` Essays on the Murder of Mr. Perceval . ''
and `` Cures for the Bite of a Mad Dog , '' as poor Goldsmith complained of the fate of far superior performances [ 2 ] .


I am still sufficiently interested to wish to know the successful candidate  and , amongst so many , I have no doubt some will be excellent , particularly in an age when writing verse is the easiest of all attainments .


I can not answer your intelligence with the `` like comfort , '' unless , as you are deeply theatrical , you may wish to hear of Mr. Betty [ 3 ] , whose acting is , I fear , utterly inadequate to the London engagement into which the managers of Covent Garden have lately entered .
His figure is fat , his features flat , his voice unmanageable , his action ungraceful , and , as Diggory [ 4 ] says , `` I defy him to extort that damned muffin face of his into madness . ''
I was very sorry to see him in the character of the `` Elephant on the slack rope  '' for , when I last saw him , I was in raptures with his performance .
But then I was sixteen -- an age to which all London condescended to subside .
After all , much better judges have admired , and may again  but I venture to `` prognosticate a prophecy '' ( see the ` Courier ' ) that he will not succeed .


So , poor dear Rogers has stuck fast on `` the brow of the mighty Helvellyn '' [ 5 ] -- I hope not for ever .
My best respects to Lady H. : -- her departure , with that of my other friends , was a sad event for me , now reduced to a state of the most cynical solitude .


`` By the waters of Cheltenham I sat down and drank , when I remembered thee , oh Georgiana Cottage !
As for our harps , we hanged them up upon the willows that grew thereby .
Then they said , Sing us a song of Drury Lane , '' etc. 


-- but I am dumb and dreary as the Israelites .
The waters have disordered me to my heart 's content -- you were right , as you always are .


Believe me , ever your obliged and affectionate servant ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Drury Lane Theatre was reopened , after the fire of February 24 , 1809 , on Saturday , October 10 , 1812 .
In the previous August the following advertisement was issued :


'' ` Rebuilding of Drury-Lane Theatre . '


`` The Committee are desirous of promoting a fair and free competition for an Address , to be spoken upon the opening of the Theatre , which will take place on the 10th of October next : They have therefore thought fit to announce to the Public , that they will be glad to receive any such Compositions , addressed to their Secretary at the Treasury Office in Drury Lane , on or before the 10th of September , sealed up , with a distinguishing word , number , or motto , on the cover , corresponding with the inscription , on a separate sealed paper , containing the name of the Author , which will not be opened , unless containing the name of the successful Candidate .
Theatre Royal , Drury-Lane , August 13 , 1812 .


`` Owing to an accidental delay in the publication of the above Advertisement , the Committee have thought proper to extend the time for receiving Addresses , from the last day of August to the 10th of September . ''


Byron , on the suggestion of Lord Holland , intended to send in an ` Address ' in competition with other similar productions .
He afterwards changed his mind , and refused to compete .
After all the ` Addresses ' had been received and rejected , the Committee applied to him to write an ` Address ' .
This he consented to do . ]


[ Footnote 2 :


`` The public were more importantly employed , than to observe the easy simplicity of my style , or the harmony of my periods .

-- To John Murray .


Cheltenham , Sept. 14 , 1812 .


DEAR SIR , -- The parcels contained some letters and verses , all ( but one ) anonymous and complimentary , and very anxious for my conversion from certain infidelities into which my good-natured correspondents conceive me to have fallen .
The books were presents of a convertible kind also , -- ` Christian Knowledge ' and the ` Bioscope ' [ 1 ] , a religious Dial of Life explained : -- to the author of the former ( Cadell , publisher , ) I beg you will forward my best thanks for his letter , his present , and , above all , his good intentions .
The ` Bioscope ' contained an MS. copy of very excellent verses , from whom I know not , but evidently the composition of some one in the habit of writing , and of writing well .
I do not know if he be the author of the ` Bioscope ' which accompanied them  but whoever he is , if you can discover him , thank him from me most heartily .
The other letters were from ladies , who are welcome to convert me when they please  and if I can discover them , and they be young , as they say they are , I could convince them perhaps of my devotion .
I had also a letter from Mr. Walpole on matters of this world , which I have answered .


So you are Lucien 's publisher !
[ 2 ] I am promised an interview with him , and think I shall ask you for a letter of introduction , as `` the gods have made him poetical . ''
From whom could it come with a better grace than from his publisher and mine ?
Is it not somewhat treasonable in you to have to do with a relative of the `` direful foe , '' as the ` Morning Post ' calls his brother ?


But my book on ` Diet and Regimen ' , where is it ?
I thirst for Scott 's ` Rokeby '  let me have y' e first-begotten copy .
The ` Anti-Jacobin Review ' [ 3 ] is all very well , and not a bit worse than the ` Quarterly ' , and at least less harmless .
By the by , have you secured my books ?
I want all the Reviews , at least the Critiques , quarterly , monthly , etc. , Portuguese and English , extracted , and bound up in one volume for my old age  and pray , sort my Romaic books , and get the volumes lent to Mr. Hobhouse -- he has had them now a long time .
If any thing occurs , you will favour me with a line , and in winter we shall be nearer neighbours .


Yours very truly ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- I was applied to to write the Address for Drury Lane , but the moment I heard of the contest , I gave up the idea of contending against all Grub Street , and threw a few thoughts on the subject into the fire .
I did this out of respect to you , being sure you would have turned off any of your authors who had entered the lists with such scurvy competitors  to triumph would have been no glory , and to have been defeated -- ` sdeath !
-- I would have choked myself , like Otway , with a quartern loaf [ 4 ]  so , remember I had , and have , nothing to do with it , upon my Honour !


[ Footnote 1 : Granville Penn ( 1761-1844 ) was the author of numerous works on religious subjects .
` The Bioscope , or Dial of Life Explained ' appeared in 1812 .
The other work referred to by Byron is probably Penn 's ` Christian 's Survey of all the Primary Events and Periods of the World ' ( 1811 ) , of which a second edition was published in 1812 . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Lucien Buonaparte ( 1775-1840 ) , Prince of Canino , since 1810 a landed proprietor in Shropshire , wrote an epic poem , ` Charlemagne , ou l'Eglise delivree ' .
It was translated ( 1815 ) by Dr. Butler of Shrewsbury and Francis Hodgson . ]

[ Footnote 4 : Otway died April , 1685 , at the age of thirty-three , from a fever contracted by drinking water when heated by running after an assassin ( Spence 's ` Anecdotes ' , p. 44 ) .
Theophilus Cibber ( ` Lives of the Poets ' , ed .
1753 , vol .

that he begged a shilling of a gentleman , and , being given a guinea , bought a roll , with which he was choked . ]

September 22 , 1812 .


My Dear Lord , -- In a day or two I will send you something which you will still have the liberty to reject if you dislike it .
I should like to have had more time , but will do my best , -- but too happy if I can oblige you , though I may offend a hundred scribblers and the discerning public .

Ecco !
-- I have marked some passages with double readings -- choose between them -- cut -- add -- reject -- or destroy -- do with them as you will -- I leave it to you and the Committee -- you can not say so called `` a non committendo . ''
What will they do ( and I do ) with the hundred and one rejected Troubadours ?
[ 1 ]


`` With trumpets , yea , and with shawms , '' will you be assailed in the most diabolical doggerel .
I wish my name not to transpire till the day is decided .
I shall not be in town , so it wo n't much matter  but let us have a good deliverer .
I think Elliston [ 2 ] should be the man , or Pope [ 3 ]  not Raymond [ 4 ] , I implore you , by the love of Rhythmus !


The passages marked thus = = , above and below , are for you to choose between epithets , and such like poetical furniture .
Pray write me a line , and believe me


Ever , etc. .


My best remembrances to Lady H. Will you be good enough to decide between the various readings marked , and erase the other  or our deliverer may be as puzzled as a commentator , and belike repeat both .
If these versicles wo n't do , I will hammer out some more endecasyllables .


P.S. -- Tell Lady H. I have had sad work to keep out the Phoenix -- I mean the Fire Office of that name .
It has insured the theatre , and why not the Address ?


[ Footnote 1 : The genuine rejected addresses were advertised for by B. McMillan , of Bow Street , Covent Garden , and forty-two of them were published by him in November , 1812 , with the following title : ` The Genuine Rejected Addresses presented to the Committee of Management for Drury Lane Theatre  preceded by that written by Lord Byron and adopted by the Committee ' .


The youngest competitor was `` Anna , a young lady in the fifteenth year of her age . ''


The actual number sent in was 112 , and sixty-nine of the competitors invoked the Phoenix .
Among the competitors were Peter Pindar , whose ` Address ' was printed in 1813  Whitbread , the manager , who gave the `` poulterer 's description '' of the Phoenix  and Horace Smith , who published his ` Address without a Phoenix ' , By S. T. P. , in ` Rejected Addresses ' . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Robert William Elliston ( 1774-1831 ) , according to Genest ( ` English Stage ' , vol .
ix .
p. 338 ) , made his first appearance at Bath in April , 1791 , as `` Tressel '' in ` Richard III ' .
, and from 1796 to 1803 Bath remained his head-quarters .
An excellent actor both in tragedy and comedy , he became in 1803 a member of the Haymarket Company .
From 1804 to 1809 , and again from 1812 to 1815 , he acted at Drury Lane .
Byron 's Prologue was spoken by him on October 10 , 1812 , at the reopening of the new theatre .
It was at Drury Lane in April , 1821 , while he was lessee ( 1819-26 ) , that Byron 's ` Marino Faliero ' was acted .
His last appearance was as `` Sheva '' in ` The Jew ' , at the Surrey Theatre , of which ( 1826-31 ) he was lessee .
In spite of his drunken habits , he won the enthusiastic praise of Charles Lamb as the `` joyousest of once embodied spirits '' ( see ` Essays of Elia ' , `` To the Shade of Elliston '' and `` Ellistoniana '' ) . ]


[ Footnote 3 : Alexander Pope ( 1763-1835 ) , miniaturist , ` gourmand ' , and actor , was for years the principal tragedian at Covent Garden .
Opinion was divided as to his merits as an actor .
He owed much to his voice , which had a `` mellow richness ... superior to any other performer on the stage . ''
Genest , who quotes the above ( vol .
ix .
p. 377 ) , adds that `` in his better days he had more pathos about him than any other actor . ''
He made his first appearance in Cork as `` Oroonoko , '' and subsequently ( January , 1785 ) at Covent Garden in the same part .
He ceased acting at Covent Garden in June , 1827 . ]

Still `` more matter for a May morning . ''
[ 1 ] Having patched the middle and end of the Address , I send one more couplet for a part of the beginning , which , if not too turgid , you will have the goodness to add .
After that flagrant image of the Thames ( I hope no unlucky wag will say I have set it on fire , though Dryden [ 2 ] , in his Annus Mirabilis , and Churchill [ 3 ] , in his Times , did it before me ) , I mean to insert this :


As flashing far the new Volcano shone } meteors { And swept the skies with } lightnings { not their own , While thousands throng'd around the burning dome , Etc. , etc. .


I think `` thousands '' less flat than `` crowds collected '' -- but do n't let me plunge into the bathos , or rise into Nat .
Lee 's Bedlam metaphors [ 4 ] .


By the by , the best view of the said fire ( which I myself saw from a house-top in Covent-garden ) was at Westminster Bridge , from the reflection on the Thames .


Perhaps the present couplet had better come in after `` trembled for their homes , '' the two lines after  -- as otherwise the image certainly sinks , and it will run just as well .


The lines themselves , perhaps , may be better thus -- ( `` choose , '' or `` refuse '' -- but please yourself , and do n't mind `` Sir Fretful '' [ 5 ] ) :


As flash'd the volumed blaze , and } sadly/ghastly { shone The skies with lightnings awful as their own .


The last runs smoothest , and , I think , best  but you know better than best .
`` Lurid '' is also a less indistinct epithet than `` livid wave , '' and , if you think so , a dash of the pen will do .


I expected one line this morning  in the mean time , I shall remodel and condense , and , if I do not hear from you , shall send another copy .


I am ever , etc. .

He collaborated with Dryden in ` OEdipus ' ( 1679 ) and ` The Duke of Guise ' ( 1682 ) .

-- To Lord Holland .


September 26 , 1812 .


You will think there is no end to my villanous emendations .
The fifth and sixth lines I think to alter thus :


Ye who beheld -- oh sight admired and mourn'd , Whose radiance mock'd the ruin it adorn'd 


because `` night '' is repeated the next line but one  and , as it now stands , the conclusion of the paragraph , `` worthy him ( Shakspeare ) and you , '' appears to apply the `` you '' to those only who were out of bed and in Covent Garden market on the night of conflagration , instead of the audience or the discerning public at large , all of whom are intended to be comprised in that comprehensive and , I hope , comprehensible pronoun .


By the by , one of my corrections in the fair copy sent yesterday has dived into the bathos some sixty fathom :


When Garrick died , and Brinsley ceased to write .


Ceasing to live is a much more serious concern , and ought not to be first  therefore I will let the old couplet stand , with its half rhymes `` sought '' and `` wrote . ''
[ 1 ]


Second thoughts in every thing are best , but , in rhyme , third and fourth do n't come amiss .
I am very anxious on this business , and I do hope that the very trouble I occasion you will plead its own excuse , and that it will tend to show my endeavour to make the most of the time allotted .
I wish I had known it months ago , for in that case I had not left one line standing on another .
I always scrawl in this way , and smooth as much as I can , but never sufficiently  and , latterly , I can weave a nine-line stanza faster than a couplet , for which measure I have not the cunning .
When I began Childe Harold , I had never tried Spenser 's measure , and now I can not scribble in any other .


After all , my dear Lord , if you can get a decent Address elsewhere , do n't hesitate to put this aside [ 2 ] .


Why did you not trust your own Muse ?
I am very sure she would have been triumphant , and saved the Committee their trouble -- '' 't is a joyful one '' to me , but I fear I shall not satisfy even myself .
After the account you sent me , 't is no compliment to say you would have beaten your candidates  but I mean that , in that case , there would have been no occasion for their being beaten at all .


There are but two decent prologues in our tongue -- Pope 's to ` Cato ' [ 3 ] -- Johnson 's to Drury-Lane [ 4 ] .


These , with the epilogue to ` The Distrest Mother ' [ 5 ] and , I think , one of Goldsmith 's [ 6 ] , and a prologue of old Colman 's to Beaumont and Fletcher 's ` Philaster ' [ 7 ] , are the best things of the kind we have .

`` Such are the names that here your plaudits sought , When Garrick acted , and when Brinsley wrote . ''


At present the couplet stands thus :


`` Dear are the days that made our annals bright , Ere Garrick fled , or Brinsley ceased to write . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 :


`` I am almost ashamed , '' writes Lord Holland to Rogers , October 22 , 1812 ( Clayden 's ` Rogers and his Contemporaries ' , vol .
i. p. 115 ) , `` of having induced Lord Byron to write on so ungrateful a theme ( ungrateful in all senses ) as the opening of a theatre  he was so good-humoured , took so much pains , corrected so good-humouredly , and produced , as I thought and think , a prologue so superior to the common run of that sort of trumpery , that it is quite vexatious to see him attacked for it .
Some part of it is a little too much laboured , and the whole too long  but surely it is good and poetical ... You can not imagine how I grew to like Lord Byron in my critical intercourse with him , and how much I am convinced that your friendship and judgment have contributed to improve both his understanding and his happiness .

Johnson wrote the Prologue to Milton 's ` Comus ' , played at Drury Lane , April 5 , 1750  to Goldsmith 's ` Good-Natured Man ' , played at Covent Garden , January 29 , 1769  and to Hugh Kelly 's ' A Word to the Wise ' , played at Drury Lane , March 3 , 1770 . ]

I believe this is the third scrawl since yesterday -- all about epithets .
I think the epithet `` intellectual '' wo n't convey the meaning I intend  and though I hate compounds , for the present I will try ( col ' permesso ) the word `` genius gifted patriots of our line '' [ 1 ] instead .
Johnson has `` many coloured life , '' a compound -- but they are always best avoided .
However , it is the only one in ninety lines [ 2 ] , but will be happy to give way to a better .
I am ashamed to intrude any more remembrances on Lady H. or letters upon you  but you are , fortunately for me , gifted with patience already too often tried by


Your etc. , etc. ,

September 27 , 1812 .


I have just received your very kind letter , and hope you have met with a second copy corrected and addressed to Holland House , with some omissions and this new couplet ,


As glared each rising flash , [ 1 ] and ghastly shone The skies with lightnings awful as their own .


As to remarks , I can only say I will alter and acquiesce in any thing .
With regard to the part which Whitbread [ 2 ] wishes to omit , I believe the ` Address ' will go off quicker without it , though , like the agility of the Hottentot , at the expense of its vigour .
I leave to your choice entirely the different specimens of stucco-work  and a brick of your own will also much improve my Babylonish turret .
I should like Elliston to have it , with your leave .
`` Adorn '' and `` mourn '' are lawful rhymes in Pope 's ` Death of the Unfortunate Lady ' .
-- Gray has `` forlorn '' and `` mourn '' -- and `` torn '' and `` mourn '' are in Smollett 's famous ` Tears of Scotland ' [ 3 ] .


As there will probably be an outcry amongst the rejected , I hope the Committee will testify ( if it be needful ) that I sent in nothing to the congress whatever , with or without a name , as your Lordship well knows .
All I have to do with it is with and through you  and though I , of course , wish to satisfy the audience , I do assure you my first object is to comply with your request , and in so doing to show the sense I have of the many obligations you have conferred upon me .


Yours ever , B .


[ Footnote 1 : At present :


`` As glared the volumed blaze . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : Samuel Whitbread ( 1758-1815 ) married , in 1789 , Elizabeth , daughter of General Sir Charles Grey , created ( 1806 ) Earl Grey , and sister of the second Earl Grey , of Reform Bill fame .
The son of a wealthy brewer , whose fortune he inherited , he entered Parliament as M.P. for Bedford in 1790 .
Raikes , in his ` Journal ' ( vol .
iv .
PP. 50 , 51 ) , speaks of him , at the outset of his career , as a staunch Foxite , and `` much remarked in society . ''
Comparing him with his brother-in-law Grey , he says ,


`` Mr. Whitbread was a more steady character  his appearance was heavy  he was fond of agriculture , and was very plain and simple in his tastes .
Both were reckoned good debaters in the House , but Grey was the most eloquent . ''


An independent Whig , and an advocate for peace with France , Whitbread supported Fox against Pitt throughout the Napoleonic War , strongly opposed its renewal after the return of the emperor from Elba , and interested himself in such measures as moderate Parliamentary reform , the amendment of the poor law , national education , and retrenchment of public expenditure .
On April 8 , 1805 , he moved the resolutions which ended in the impeachment of Lord Melville , and took the lead in the inquiries , which were made , March , 1809 , into the conduct of the Duke of York .
He was a plain , business-like speaker , and a man of such unimpeachable integrity that Mr. , afterwards Lord , Plunket , in a speech on the Roman Catholic claims , February 28 , 1821 , called him `` the incorruptible sentinel of the constitution . ''


When he moved the articles of impeachment against Lord Melville , Canning scribbled the following impromptu parody of his speech ( ` Anecdotal History of the British Parliament ' , p. 222 ) :


`` I 'm like Archimedes for science and skill  I 'm like a young prince going straight up a hill  I 'm like -- ( with respect to the fair be it said ) -- I 'm like a young lady just bringing to bed .
If you ask why the 11th of June I remember Much better than April , or May , or November , On that day , my lords , with truth I assure ye , My sainted progenitor set up his brewery  On that day , in the morn , he began brewing beer  On that day , too , commenced his connubial career ] On that day he received and he issued his bills  On that day he cleared out all the cash from his tills  On that day he died , having finished his summing , And the angels all cried , ` Here 's old Whitbread a-coming ! '
So that day still I hail with a smile and a sigh , For his beer with an E , and his bier with an I  And still on that day , in the hottest of weather , The whole Whitbread family dine all together .
-- So long as the beams of this house shall support The roof which o'ershades this respectable Court , Where Hastings was tried for oppressing the Hindoos  So long as that sun shall shine in at those windows , My name shall shine bright as my ancestor 's shines , ` Mine ' recorded in journals , ` his ' blazoned on signs ! ''


An active member of Parliament , a large landed proprietor , the manager of his immense brewery in Chiswell Street , Whitbread also found time to reduce to order the chaotic concerns of Drury Lane Theatre .
He was , with Lord Holland and Harvey Combe , responsible for the request to Byron to write an address , having first rejected his own address with its `` poulterer 's description of the Phoenix . ''
He was fond of private theatricals , and Dibdin ( ` Reminiscences ' , vol .
ii .
pp. 383 , 384 ) gives the play-bill of an entertainment given by him at Southill .
In the first play , ` The Happy Return ' , he took the part of `` Margery  '' and in the second , ` Fatal Duplicity ' , that of `` Eglantine , '' a very young lady , loved by `` Sir Buntybart '' and `` Sir Brandywine . ''
In his capacity as manager of Drury Lane , Whitbread is represented by the author of ` Accepted Addresses ' ( 1813 ) as addressing `` the M -- s of H -- d '' --


`` My LORD , --


`` As I now have the honour to be By ` Man ` ging ' a ` Playhouse ' a double M.P. , In this my address I think fit to complain Of certain encroachments on great Drury Lane , '' etc. , etc. .


Whitbread strongly supported the cause of the Princess of Wales .
Miss Berry ( ` Journal ' , vol .
iii .
p. 25 ) says that he dictated the letters which the Princess wrote to the Queen , who had desired that she should not attend the two drawing-rooms to be held in June , 1814 .
`` They were good , '' she adds , `` but too long , and sometimes marked by Whitbread 's want of taste . ''


The strain of his multifarious activities affected both his health and his mind , and he committed suicide July 6 , 1815 . ]


[ Footnote 3 :


`` By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd , By strangers honour'd , and by strangers mourn'd . ''


( Pope . )


`` Stay , oh stay !

Cheltenham , September 27 , 1812 .


Dear Sir , -- I sent in no ` Address ' whatever to the Committee  but out of nearly one hundred ( this is confidential ) , none have been deemed worth acceptance  and in consequence of their subsequent application to me , I have written a prologue , which has been received , and will be spoken .
The MS. is now in the hands of Lord Holland .


I write this merely to say , that ( however it is received by the audience ) you will publish it in the next edition of Childe Harold  and I only beg you at present to keep my name secret till you hear further from me , and as soon as possible I wish you to have a correct copy , to do with as you think proper .


I am , yours very truly , BYRON .


P.S. -- I should wish a few copies printed off before , that the Newspaper copies may be correct after the delivery .

Will this do better ?
The metaphor is more complete .


Till slowly ebb'd the } lava of the/spent volcanic { wave , And blackening ashes mark'd the Muse 's grave .


If not , we will say `` burning wave , '' and instead of `` burning clime , '' in the line some couplets back , have `` glowing . ''


Is Whitbread determined to castrate all my cavalry lines [ 1 ] ?
I do n't see why t ` other house should be spared  besides it is the public , who ought to know better  and you recollect Johnson 's was against similar buffooneries of Rich 's -- but , certes , I am not Johnson .
[ 2 ]


Instead of `` effects , '' say `` labours '' -- `` degenerate '' will do , will it ?
Mr. Betty is no longer a babe , therefore the line can not be personal .
Will this do ?


Till ebb'd the lava of } the burning { / } that molten { wave [ 3 ]


with `` glowing dome , '' in case you prefer `` burning '' added to this `` wave '' metaphorical .
The word `` fiery pillar '' was suggested by the `` pillar of fire '' in the book of Exodus , which went before the Israelites through the Red Sea .
I once thought of saying `` like Israel 's pillar , '' and making it a simile , but I did not know , -- the great temptation was leaving the epithet `` fiery '' for the supplementary wave .
I want to work up that passage , as it is the only new ground us prologuizers can go upon --


This is the place where , if a poet Shined in description , he might show it .


If I part with the possibility of a future conflagration , we lessen the compliment to Shakspeare .
However , we will e ` en mend it thus :


Yes , it shall be -- the magic of that name , That scorns the scythe of Time , the torch of Flame , On the same spot , etc. , etc. .


There -- the deuce is in it , if that is not an improvement to Whitbread 's content .
Recollect , it is the `` name , '' and not the `` magic , '' that has a noble contempt for those same weapons .
If it were the `` magic , '' my metaphor would be somewhat of the maddest -- so the `` name '' is the antecedent .
But , my dear Lord , your patience is not quite so immortal -- therefore , with many and sincere thanks , I am ,


Yours ever most affectionately .


P.S. -- I foresee there will be charges of partiality in the papers  but you know I sent in no Address  and glad both you and I must be that I did not , for , in that case , their plea had been plausible .
I doubt the Pit will be testy  but conscious innocence ( a novel and pleasing sensation ) makes me bold .


[ Footnote 1 : The lines which were omitted by the Committee ran thus :


'' ` Nay , lower still , the Drama yet deplores That late she deigned to crawl upon all-fours .
When Richard roars in Bosworth for a horse , If you command , the steed must come in course .
If you decree , the Stage must condescend ' To soothe the sickly taste we dare not mend .
Blame not our judgment should we acquiesce , And gratify you more by showing less .
Oh , since your Fiat stamps the Drama 's laws , Forbear to mock us with misplaced applause  That public praise be ne'er again disgraced , From } brutes to man recall { / } babes and brutes redeem { a nation 's taste  Then pride shall doubly nerve the actor 's powers , When Reason 's voice is echoed back by ours . ''


The last couplet but one was altered in a subsequent copy , thus :


'' ` The past reproach let present scenes refute , Nor shift from man to babe , from babe to brute ' . ''


On February 18 , 1811 , at Covent Garden , a troop of horses were introduced in ` Bluebeard ' .
For the manager , Juvenal 's words , `` Lucri bonus est odor ex re Qualibet '' ( ` Sat ' .
xiv .
204 ) may have been true  but , as the dressing-room of the equine comedians was under the orchestra , the stench on the first night was to the audience intolerable .
At the same theatre , April 29 , 1811 , the horses were again brought on the stage in Lewis 's ` Timour the Tartar ' .
At the same theatre , on the following December 26 , a live elephant appeared .
The novelty had , however , been anticipated in the Dublin Theatre during the season of 1771-72 ( Genest 's ` English Stage ' , vol .
viii .
p. 287 ) .
At the Haymarket , and Drury Lane , the introduction of live animals was ridiculed .
` The Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh ' was given at the Haymarket , July 26 , 1811 , as a burlesque on ` Timour the Tartar ' and the horses .
The Prologue , by Colman the Younger , attacks the passion for German plays and animal actors :


`` Your taste , recover'd half from foreign quacks , Takes airings , now , on English horses ' backs  While every modern bard may raise his name , If not on lasting praise , on stable fame . ''


At the Lyceum , during the season 1811-12 , ` Quadrupeds , or the Manager 's Last Kick ' , in which the tailors were mounted on asses and mules , was given by the Drury Lane Company with success .
It was this introduction of animal performers which Byron wished to attack . ]


[ Footnote 2 : The following are the lines in Johnson 's ` Prologue ' to which Byron refers :


`` Then crush'd by rules , and weaken'd as refined , For years the power of Tragedy declined  From bard to bard the frigid caution crept , Till Declamation roared , whilst Passion slept .
Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread , Philosophy remained though Nature fled .
But forced , at length , her ancient reign to quit , She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of Wit  Exulting Folly hailed the joyous Day , And Pantomime and Song confirmed her sway .
But who the coming changes can presage , And mark the future periods of the Stage ?
Perhaps if skill could distant times explore , New Behns , new Durfeys , yet remain in store  Perhaps , where Lear has raved , and Hamlet died , On flying cars new sorcerers may ride  Perhaps ( for who can guess th ' effects of chance ? )
Here Hunt may box , or Mahomet may dance . ''


John Rich ( circ .
1682-1761 ) was the creator of pantomime in England , which he introduced at Lincoln 's Inn Fields in April , 1716 , and in which , under the stage name of Lun , he played the part of Harlequin .
At Lincoln 's Inn Fields , January 29 , 1728 , he produced ` The Beggar 's Opera ' , which , after being refused at Drury Lane , made `` Gay ` rich ' , and Rich ` gay ' . ''
`` Great Faustus '' probably alludes to the war between the two theatres , and the rival productions of ` Harlequin Dr. Faustus ' at Drury Lane in 1723 , and of ` The Necromancer , or the History of Dr. Faustus ' at Lincoln 's Inn Fields in December of the same year .
On December 7 , 1732 , Rich opened the new theatre at Covent Garden , of which he remained manager till his death in 1761 . ]

`` Till blackening ashes and lonely wall Usurp'd the Muse 's realm , and mark'd her fall . '' ]

-- To Lord Holland .


September 28 .


I have altered the middle couplet , so as I hope partly to do away with W. 's objection .
I do think , in the present state of the stage , it had been unpardonable to pass over the horses and Miss Mudie [ 1 ] , etc. .
As Betty is no longer a boy , how can this be applied to him ?
He is now to be judged as a man .
If he acts still like a boy , the public will but be more ashamed of their blunder .
I have , you see , now taken it for granted that these things are reformed .
I confess , I wish that part of the Address to stand  but if W. is inexorable , e ` en let it go .
I have also new-cast the lines , and softened the hint of future combustion , and sent them off this morning .
Will you have the goodness to add , or insert , the approved alterations as they arrive ?
They `` come like shadows , so depart , '' [ 2 ] occupy me , and , I fear , disturb you .


Do not let Mr. W. put his Address into Elliston 's hands till you have settled on these alterations .
E. will think it too long : -- much depends on the speaking .
I fear it will not bear much curtailing , without chasms in the sense .


It is certainly too long in the reading  but if Elliston exerts himself , such a favourite with the public will not be thought tedious .
I should think it so , if he were not to speak it .


Yours ever , etc. .


P.S. -- On looking again , I doubt my idea of having obviated W. 's objection .
To the other House allusion is non sequitur -- but I wish to plead for this part , because the thing really is not to be passed over .
Many afterpieces of the Lyceum by the same company have already attacked this `` Augean Stable '' -- and Johnson , in his prologue against `` Lunn '' ( the harlequin manager , Rich ) , -- `` Hunt , '' -- `` Mahomet , '' etc. is surely a fair precedent .
[ 3 ]


[ Footnote 1 : For the horses , see p. 156 , ` note ' 1 .
Miss Mudie , another `` Phenomenon , '' with whom the Covent Garden manager hoped to rival the success of Master Betty , was announced in the ` Morning Post ' , July 29 , 1805 , as the `` Young Roscia of the Dublin Stage . ''
She appeared at Covent Garden , November 23 , 1805 , in the part of `` Peggy '' in ` The Country Girl ' , Miss Brunton being `` Alithea , '' C. Kemble `` Harcourt , '' and Moody `` Murray . ''
Being hissed by the audience , she walked with great composure to the front of the stage , and said , as reported in the ` Morning Post ' ( November 25 , 1805 )


`` Ladies and gentlemen , -- I know nothing I have done to offend you , and has set ( ` sic ' ) those who are sent here to hiss me  I will be very much obliged to you to turn them out . ''


This unfortunate speech made matters worse  the audience refused to hear her , and her part was finished by Miss Searle .


Miss Mudie was said to be only eight years old .
But J. Kemble , being asked if she were really such a child , answered , '' ` Child ' !
Why , sir , when I was a very young actor in the York Company , that little creature kept an inn at Tadcaster , and had a large family '' ( Clark Russell 's ` Representative Actors ' , p. 363 , ` note ' 2 ) .
The ` Morning Post ' ( April 5 , 1806 ) says that Miss Mudie afterwards joined a children 's troupe in Leicester Place , where , `` though deservedly discountenanced at a great theatre , she will , no doubt , prove an acquisition to the infant establishment '' ( Ashton 's ` Dawn of the XIXth Century in England ' , pp. 333-336 ) . ]

-- To William Bankes .


Cheltenham , September 28 , 1812 .


MY DEAR BANKES , -- When you point out to one how people can be intimate at the distance of some seventy leagues , I will plead guilty to your charge , and accept your farewell , but not wittingly , till you give me some better reason than my silence , which merely proceeded from a notion founded on your own declaration of old , that you hated writing and receiving letters .
Besides , how was I to find out a man of many residences ?
If I had addressed you now , it had been to your borough , where I must have conjectured you were amongst your constituents .
So now , in despite of Mr. N. and Lady W. , you shall be as `` much better '' as the Hexham post-office will allow me to make you .
I do assure you I am much indebted to you for thinking of me at all , and ca n't spare you even from amongst the superabundance of friends with whom you suppose me surrounded .


You heard that Newstead [ 1 ] is sold -- the sum L140 ,000  sixty to remain in mortgage on the estate for three years , paying interest , of course .
Rochdale is also likely to do well -- so my worldly matters are mending .
I have been here some time drinking the waters , simply because there are waters to drink , and they are very medicinal , and sufficiently disgusting .
In a few days I set out for Lord Jersey 's [ 2 ] , but return here , where I am quite alone , go out very little , and enjoy in its fullest extent the dolce far niente .
What you are about I can not guess , even from your date  -- not dauncing to the sound of the gitourney in the Halls of the Lowthers ?
one of whom is here , ill , poor thing , with a phthisic .
I heard that you passed through here ( at the sordid inn where I first alighted ) the very day before I arrived in these parts .
We had a very pleasant set here  at first the Jerseys , Melbournes [ 3 ] , Cowpers [ 4 ] , and Hollands , but all gone  and the only persons I know are the Rawdons [ 5 ] and Oxfords [ 6 ] , with some later acquaintances of less brilliant descent .


But I do not trouble them much  and as for your rooms and your assemblies `` they are not dreamed of in our philosophy !! ''
-- Did you read of a sad accident in the Wye t ` other day [ 7 ] ?
A dozen drowned  and Mr. Rossoe , a corpulent gentleman , preserved by a boat-hook or an eel-spear , begged , when he heard his wife was saved -- no -- lost -- to be thrown in again !!
-- as if he could not have thrown himself in , had he wished it  but this passes for a trait of sensibility .
What strange beings men are , in and out of the Wye !


I have to ask you a thousand pardons for not fulfilling some orders before I left town  but if you knew all the cursed entanglements I had to wade through , it would be unnecessary to beg your forgiveness .
-- When will Parliament ( the new one ) meet [ 8 ] ?
-- in sixty days , on account of Ireland , I presume : the Irish election will demand a longer period for completion than the constitutional allotment .
Yours , of course , is safe , and all your side of the question .
Salamanca is the ministerial watchword , and all will go well with you .
I hope you will speak more frequently , I am sure at least you ought , and it will be expected .
I see Portman means to stand again .
Good night .


Ever yours most affectionately ,


[ Greek : Mpairon . ]


[ Footnote 1 : Newstead was put up at Garraway 's in the autumn of 1812  but only L90 ,000 were bid , and the property was therefore withdrawn .
Subsequently it was privately sold to a Mr. Claughton , who found himself unable to complete the purchase , and forfeited L25 ,000 on the contract .
Newstead was eventually sold , in November , 1817 , to Colonel Wildman , Byron 's Harrow schoolfellow , for L94 ,500 . ]


[ Footnote 2 : For Lady Jersey , see p. 112 , ` note ' 1 [ Footnote 1 of Letter 230 ] .
The following passage , from Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' , gives an account of the party at Middleton :


`` In 1812 at Middelton ( Lord Jersey 's ) , amongst a goodly company of Lords , Ladies , and wits , etc. , there was poor old Vice Leach , the lawyer , attempting to play off the fine gentleman .
His first exhibition , an attempt on horseback , I think , to escort the women -- God knows where -- in the month of November , ended in a fit of the Lumbago -- as Lord Ogleby says , ' a grievous enemy to Gallantry and address ' -- and if he could have but heard Lady Jersey quizzing him ( as I did ) next day for the cause of his malady , I do n't think that he would have turned a ` Squire of dames ' in a hurry again .
He seemed to me the greatest fool ( in that line ) I ever saw .
This was the last I saw of old Vice Leach , except in town , where he was creeping into assemblies , and trying to look young -- and gentlemanly .


`` Erskine too !
-- Erskine was there -- good but intolerable .
He jested , he talked , he did everything admirably , but then he ` would ' be applauded for the same thing twice over .
He would read his own verses , his own paragraphs , and tell his own story again and again  and then ` the trial by Jury !!! '
-- I almost wished it abolished , for I sate next him at dinner , and , as I had read his published speeches , there was no occasion to repeat them to me .
Chester ( the fox-hunter ) , surnamed ` Cheek Chester , ' and I sweated the Claret , being the only two who did so .
Cheek , who loves his bottle , and had no notion of meeting with a ` bonvivant ' in a scribbler , in making my eulogy to somebody one evening , summed it up in ` by G-d , he ` drinks like a Man ' ! ' '' ]


[ Footnote 3 : Sir Peniston Lamb , created an Irish baron as Lord Melbourne in 1770 , an Irish viscount in 1780 , and an English peer in 1815 , married , in 1769 , Elizabeth , only daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke , of Halnaby , Yorkshire , one of the cleverest and most beautiful women of the day .
Horace Walpole , writing to Mason , May 12 , 1778 , mentions her when she was at the height of her beauty .


`` On Tuesday , '' he says , `` I supped , after the opera , at Mrs. Meynel 's with a set of the most fashionable company , which , take notice , I very seldom do now , as I certainly am not of the age to mix often with young people .
Lady Melbourne was standing before the fire , and adjusting her feathers in the glass .
Says she , ` Lord , they say the stocks will blow up !
That will be very comical . ' ''


Greville ( ` Memoirs ' , ed .
1888 , vol .
vi .
p. 248 ) associates her name with that of Lord Egremont .
Reynolds painted her with her eldest son in his well-known picture ` Maternal Affection ' .
Her second son , William , afterwards Prime Minister , used to say ,


`` Ah !
my mother was a most remarkable woman  not merely clever and engaging , but the most sagacious woman I ever knew ''


( ` Memoirs of Viscount Melbourne ' , vol .
i. p. 135 ) .
Lady Melbourne , whom Byron spoke of as


`` the best , the kindest , and ablest female I have ever known , old or young , ''


died in 1818 , her husband in 1828 .
He thus described her to Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , p. 225 ) :


`` Lady M. , who might have been my mother , excited an interest in my feelings that few young women have been able to awaken .
She was a charming person -- a sort of modern Aspasia , uniting the energy of a man 's mind with the delicacy and tenderness of a woman 's .
She wrote and spoke admirably , because she felt admirably .
Envy , malice , hatred , or uncharitableness , found no place in her feelings .
She had all of philosophy , save its moroseness , and all of nature , save its defects and general ` faiblesse '  or if some portion of ` faiblesse ' attached to her , it only served to render her more forbearing to the errors of others .
I have often thought , that , with a little more youth , Lady M. might have turned my head , at all events she often turned my heart , by bringing me back to mild feelings , when the demon passion was strong within me .
Her mind and heart were as fresh as if only sixteen summers had flown over her , instead of four times that number . '' ]


[ Footnote 4 : Peter , fifth Earl Cowper ( 1778-1837 ) , married , in 1805 Emily Mary Lamb , daughter of Lord Melbourne  she married , secondly , in 1839 , Lord Palmerston . ]


[ Footnote 5 : Francis Rawdon , second Earl of Moira ( 1754-1826 ) , created Lord Rawdon ( 1783 ) , and Marquis of Hastings ( 1817 ) , married , in 1804 , the Countess of Loudoun . ]


[ Footnote 6 : Edward Harley ( 1773-1848 ) succeeded his uncle as fifth Earl of Oxford in 1790 , and married , in 1794 , Jane Elizabeth , daughter of the Rev. James Scott , Vicar of Itchin , Hants .
It is probably of Lady Oxford , whose picture was painted by Hoppner , that Byron spoke to Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , p. 255 ) ,


`` Even now the autumnal charms of Lady -- are remembered by me with more than admiration .
She resembled a landscape by Claude Lorraine , with a setting sun , her beauties enhanced by the knowledge that they were shedding their last dying beams , which threw a radiance around .
A woman ... is only grateful for her ` first ' and ` last ' conquest .
The first of poor dear Lady -- 's was achieved before I entered on this world of care  but the ` last ' , I do flatter myself , was reserved for me , and a ` bonne bouche ' it was . ''


The following passage certainly relates to Lady Oxford :


`` There was a lady at that time , '' said Byron ( Medwin 's ` Conversations ' , pp. 93 , 94 ) , `` double my own age , the mother of several children who were perfect angels , with whom I had formed a ` liaison ' that continued without interruption for eight months .
The autumn of a beauty like her 's is preferable to the spring in others .
She told me she was never in love till she was thirty  and I thought myself so with her when she was forty .
I never felt a stronger passion  which she returned with equal ardour ... She had been sacrificed , almost before she was a woman , to one whose mind and body were equally contemptible in the scale of creation  and on whom she bestowed a numerous family , to which the law gave him the right to be called father .
Strange as it may seem , she gained ( as all women do ) an influence over me so strong , that I had great difficulty in breaking with her , even when I knew she had been inconstant to me : and once was on the point of going abroad with her , and narrowly escaped this folly . ''


To be near the Oxfords at Eywood , in Herefordshire , Byron took Kinsham Court , a dower-house of the family , where Bishop Harley died in 1788 .
At one time , as is evident from his correspondence with Hanson , he was bent on going abroad with Lady Oxford .
In the end he only accompanied her to Portsmouth .
Of Lady Oxford , Uvedale Price wrote thus to Rogers ( Clayden , ` Rogers and his Contemporaries ' , vol .
i. pp. 397 , 398 ) :


`` This is a melancholy subject '' -- [ the death , by consumption of Lord Aberdeen 's children ] -- `` and I must go to another .
Poor Lady Oxford !
I had heard with great concern of her dangerous illness , but hoped she might get through it , and was much , very much grieved to hear that it had ended fatally .
I had , as you know , lived a great deal with her from the time she came into this country , immediately after her marriage  but for some years past , since she went abroad , had scarcely had any correspondence or intercourse with her , till I met her in town last spring .
I then saw her twice , and both times she seemed so overjoyed to see an old friend , and expressed her joy so naturally and cordially , that I felt no less overjoyed at seeing her after so long an absence .
She talked , with great satisfaction , of our meeting for a longer time this next spring , little thinking of an eternal separation .
There could not , in all respects , be a more ill-matched pair than herself and Lord Oxford , or a stronger instance of the cruel sports of Venus , or , rather , of Hymen --


` Cui placet impares Formas atque animos sub juga ahenea Saevo mittere cum joco . '


`` It has been said that she was , in some measure , forced into the match .
Had she been united to a man whom she had loved , esteemed , and respected , she herself might have been generally respected and esteemed , as well as loved  but in her situation , to keep clear of all misconduct required a strong mind or a cold heart  perhaps both , and she had neither .
Her failings were in no small degree the effect of circumstances  her amiable qualities all her own .
There was something about her , in spite of her errors , remarkably attaching , and that something was not merely her beauty .
` Kindness has resistless charms , ' and she was full of affectionate kindness to those she loved , whether as friends or as lovers .
As a friend , I always found her the same , never at all changeful or capricious .
As I am not a very rigid moralist , and am extremely open to kindness , ' I could have better spared a better woman . ' '' ]


[ Footnote 7 : An account of the accident is given in the Chronicle of the ` Annual Register ' , September 21 , 1812 .
The party consisted of ten people , three of whom were saved .
Among those rescued was Mr. Rothery -- not Rossoe , as Byron gives it . ]

Shakespeare certainly ceased to reign in one of his kingdoms , as George III .

Now , we have nothing to do out of our own realms , and when the monarchy was gone , his majesty had but a barren sceptre .
I have cut away , you will see , and altered , but make it what you please  only I do implore , for my own gratification , one lash on those accursed quadrupeds -- `` a long shot , Sir Lucius , if you love me . ''

Let me hear from you when convenient , and believe me , etc. .

I send you the most I can make of it  for I am not so well as I was , and find I `` pull in resolution . ''
[ 1 ]


I wish much to see you , and will be at Tetbury by twelve on Saturday  and from thence I go on to Lord Jersey 's .
It is impossible not to allude to the degraded state of the Stage , but I have lightened it , and endeavoured to obviate your other objections .
There is a new couplet for Sheridan , allusive to his Monody [ 2 ] .
All the alterations I have marked thus ] , -- as you will see by comparison with the other copy .
I have cudgelled my brains with the greatest willingness , and only wish I had more time to have done better .


You will find a sort of clap-trap laudatory couplet inserted for the quiet of the Committee [ 3 ] , and I have added , towards the end , the couplet you were pleased to like .
The whole Address is seventy-three lines , still perhaps too long  and , if shortened , you will save time , but , I fear , a little of what I meant for sense also .


With myriads of thanks , I am ever , etc. .

`` of one peer and two commoners , one poet and two prosers , one Lord and two Brewers  and the only points in which they coincided were in being all three parliament men , all three politicians , all three in opposition to the Government of the country .
Their names , as we understand , were Vassal Holland , Samuel Whitbread , and Harvey Christian Combe . '' ]

Far be from him that hour which asks in vain Tears such as flow for Garrick in his strain 


or ,


Far be that hour that vainly asks in turn Such verse for him as } crown'd his/wept o'er { Garrick 's urn .


September 30 , 1812 .


Will you choose between these added to the lines on Sheridan [ 1 ] ?


I think they will wind up the panegyric , and agree with the train of thought preceding them .


Now , one word as to the Committee -- how could they resolve on a rough copy of an Address never sent in , unless you had been good enough to retain in memory , or on paper , the thing they have been good enough to adopt ?
By the by , the circumstances of the case should make the Committee less avidus gloriae , for all praise of them would look plaguy suspicious .
If necessary to be stated at all , the simple facts bear them out .
They surely had a right to act as they pleased .
My sole object is one which , I trust , my whole conduct has shown  viz .
that I did nothing insidious -- sent in no Address whatever -- but , when applied to , did my best for them and myself  but , above all , that there was no undue partiality , which will be what the rejected will endeavour to make out .
Fortunately -- most fortunately -- I sent in no lines on the occasion .
For I am sure that had they , in that case , been preferred , it would have been asserted that I was known , and owed the preference to private friendship .
This is what we shall probably have to encounter  but , if once spoken and approved , we sha 'n' t be much embarrassed by their brilliant conjectures  and , as to criticism , an old author , like an old bull , grows cooler ( or ought ) at every baiting .


The only thing would be to avoid a party on the night of delivery -- afterwards , the more the better , and the whole transaction inevitably tends to a good deal of discussion .
Murray tells me there are myriads of ironical Addresses [ 2 ] ready -- some , in imitation of what is called my style .
If they are as good as the ` Probationary Odes ' [ 3 ] , or Hawkins 's ` Pipe of Tobacco ' [ 4 ] , it will not be bad fun for the imitated .


Ever , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 : These added lines , as may be seen by reference to the printed Address , were not retained . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Probably the reference is to ` Rejected Addresses , or the New Theatrum Poetarum ' ( 1812 ) , by James ( 1775-1839 ) and Horace ( 1779-1849 ) Smith .
`` Cui Bono ? ''
the parody on Byron , is the joint composition of James and Horace .
The manuscript was offered to Murray for L20 , but declined by him .
It was afterwards published by John Miller , of Bow Street , Covent Garden , who also published ` Horace in London ' . ]


[ Footnote 3 : ` Probationary Odes ' , which generally forms , with ` Political Eclogues ' , the third portion of the ` Rolliad ' , is really distinct from that work .
It is the result of an imaginary contest for the laureate-ship .
Each candidate was to deliver a `` Probationary Birthday Ode , '' and among the candidates are Dr. Pretyman , Archbishop Markham , Thomas and Joseph Warton , Sir Cecil Wray , Sir Joseph Mawbey , Henry Dundas , Lord Thurlow , and other Tories of the day .
The plan of the work is said to have been suggested by Joseph Richardson ( 1755-1803 ) , who wrote Odes iv .
( Sir Richard Hill ) and xix .
( Lord Mountmorres ) . ]


[ Footnote 4 : ` In Praise of a Pipe of Tobacco ' ( 1736 ) , written by Isaac Hawkins Browne ( 1705-1760 ) , was an ode in imitation of Swift , Pope , Thomson , and other contemporary poets .
Browne represented Wenlock in the Whig interest in the Parliaments of 1744 and 1747 .
Johnson spoke of him ( Boswell , ` Johnson ' , April 5 , 1775 ) as `` one of the first wits of this country , '' who `` got into Parliament , and never opened his mouth . '' ]

Cheltenham , Oct. 12 , 1812 .


DEAR SIR , -- I have a very strong objection to the engraving of the portrait [ 1 ] , and request that it may , on no account , be prefixed  but let all the proofs be burnt , and the plate broken .
I will be at the expense which has been incurred  it is but fair that I should , since I can not permit the publication .
I beg , as a particular favour , that you will lose no time in having this done , for which I have reasons that I will state when I see you .
Forgive all the trouble I have occasioned you .


I have received no account of the reception of the Address [ 2 ] , but see it is vituperated in the papers , which does not much embarrass an old author .
I leave it to your own judgment to add it , or not , to your next edition when required .
Pray comply strictly with my wishes as to the engraving , and believe me , etc. .


Yours very truly ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- Favour me with an answer , as I shall not be easy until I hear that the proofs , etc. , are destroyed .
I hear that the Satirist has reviewed Childe Harold [ 3 ] , in what manner I need not ask  but I wish to know if the old personalities are revived ?
I have a better reason for asking this than any that merely concerns myself  but in publications of that kind , others , particularly female names , are sometimes introduced .


[ Footnote 1 : A miniature by Sanders .
Besides this miniature , Sanders had also painted a full-length of Byron , from which the portrait prefixed to the quarto edition of Moore 's ` Life ' is engraved .
In reference to the latter picture , Byron says , in a note to Rogers ,


`` If you think the picture you saw at Murray 's worth your acceptance , it is yours  and you may put a glove or mask on it , if you like '' ( Moore ) . ]


[ Footnote 2 : On Saturday , October 10 , Drury Lane reopened with ` The Devil to Pay ' and ` Hamlet ' .
Then , after the whole body of actors had sung `` God save the King '' and `` Rule , Britannia , '' Elliston delivered Byron 's address . ]


[ Footnote 3 : ` The Satirist , a Monthly Meteor ' ( see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 321 , ` note ' 3 [ Footnote 3 of Letter 159 ] ) , ran from October , 1807 , to 1814 .
Up to 1812 it was the property of George Manners , who sold it in that year to W. Jerdan .
It reviewed ` Childe Harold ' in October , 1812 ( pp. 344-358 )  and again in December of the same year ( pp. 542-550 ) .
In the first of the two notices , the ` Satirist ' quotes the `` judgment of our predecessors , '' that unless Byron `` improved wonderfully , he could never be a poet , '' and continues thus :


`` It is with unaffected satisfaction we find that he has improved wonderfully , and that he is a poet .
Indeed , when we consider the comparatively short interval which has elapsed , and contrast the character of his recent with that of his early work , we confess ourselves astonished at the intellectual progress which Lord Byron has made , and are happy to hold him up as another example of the extraordinary effects of study and cultivation , ` even ' on minds apparently of the most unpromising description . ''


The reviewer severely condemns the morbid bitterness of the poet 's thought and feeling , but yet affirms that the poems


`` abound with beautiful imagery , clothed in a diction free , forcible , and various .
` Childe Harold ' , although avowedly a fragment , contains many fragments which would do honour to any poet , of any period , in any country . '' ]

-- To Lord Holland .


Cheltenham , Oct. 14 , 1812 .


MY DEAR LORD , -- I perceive that the papers , yea , even Perry 's [ 1 ] , are somewhat ruffled at the injudicious preference of the Committee .
My friend Perry has , indeed , ` et tu , Brute ' - d me rather scurvily , for which I will send him , for the ` Morning Chronicle ' , the next epigram I scribble , as a token of my full forgiveness .


Do the Committee mean to enter into no explanation of their proceedings ?
You must see there is a leaning towards a charge of partiality .
You will , at least , acquit me of any great anxiety to push myself before so many elder and better anonymous , to whom the twenty guineas ( which I take to be about two thousand pounds ` Bank ' currency ) and the honour would have been equally welcome .
`` Honour , '' I see , `` hath skill in paragraph-writing . ''


I wish to know how it went off at the second reading , and whether any one has had the grace to give it a glance of approbation .
I have seen no paper but Perry 's and two Sunday ones .
Perry is severe , and the others silent .
If , however , you and your Committee are not now dissatisfied with your own judgments , I shall not much embarrass myself about the brilliant remarks of the journals .
My own opinion upon it is what it always was , perhaps pretty near that of the public .


Believe me , my dear Lord , etc. , etc. .


P.S. -- My best respects to Lady H. , whose smiles will be very consolatory , even at this distance .


[ Footnote 1 : James Perry ( 1756-1821 ) purchased , in 1789 , the ` Morning Chronicle ' , originally established by Woodfall in 1769 .
In Perry 's hands the paper became the leading organ of the Whigs .
He was the first editor to introduce a succession of parliamentary reporters .
He gathered round him a remarkable staff of contributors , including Ricardo , Sir James Mackintosh , Porson ( who married his sister ) , Charles Lamb , Sheridan , Coleridge , Hazlitt , Lord Campbell , Moore , Campbell , Byron , and Burns .
The ` Morning Chronicle ' ( October 12 , 1812 ) says :


`` Mr. Elliston then came forward and delivered the following ` Prize ' Address .
We can not boast of the eloquence of the delivery .
It was neither gracefully nor correctly recited .
The merits of the production itself we submit to the criticism of our readers .
We can not suppose that it was selected as the most poetical composition of all the scores that were submitted to the Committee .
But , perhaps by its tenor , by its allusions to the fire , to Garrick , to Siddons , and to Sheridan , it was thought most applicable to the occasion , notwithstanding its being in parts unmusical , and in general tame . ''


Again ( October 14 ) , in a notice of ` Rejected Addresses ' , the ` Morning Chronicle ' returns to the subject :


`` A wag has already published a small volume of ` Addresses rejected ' , in which , with admirable wit , all the poets of the day are assembled , contesting for the Prize Address at Drury Lane .
And certainly he has assigned to the pen of Lord B. a superior ` poem ' to that which has gained the prize . ''


The Address was also severely handled in ' A Critique on the Address written by Lord Byron , which was Spoken at the opening of the New Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , October ' 10 , 1812 .
By Lord -------- ( London , no date ) .
The author is `` astonished at the glaring faults and general insipidity '' of the address , and , after a detailed criticism , concludes that `` public indignation '' will sympathize with the rejected poets , and `` pursue the rival patrons and the rival bard . ''


Rogers , writing to Moore , October 22 , 1812 ( ` Memoirs , etc. , of Thomas Moore ' , vol .
viii .
p. 123 ) , says ,


`` Poor Byron !
what I hear and read of his prologue makes me very angry .
Of such value is public favour !
So a man is to be tried by a copy of verses thrown off perhaps at hazard , and ` invita Minerva ! ' '' ]

Mrs. M [ assingberd ] [ 2 ] is dead , and I would wish something settled for the Daughter who is still responsible .
Will you give a glance into that business , and if possible first settle something about the Annuities .


I shall perhaps draw within a L100 next week , but I will delay for your answer on C. 's business .


Ever yours , sincerely and affectionately ,


BYRON .


My love to all the family .


I wish to do something for young Rushton , if practicable at Rochdale  if not , think of some situation where he might occupy himself to avoid Idleness , in the mean time .


[ Footnote 1 : Deardon was the lessee of the Rochdale coal-pits .


`` When Mr. France was here , '' writes Mrs. Byron to Hanson , July 13 , 1811 ( Koelbing 's ` Englische Studien ' , vol .
xxv .
p. I53 ) , `` he told me there had been an injunction procured to prevent Deardin from working the Coal Pits that was in dispute between Lord Byron and him , but since France was here , there has been a Man from Lancashire who says they are worked by Deardin the same as ever .
I also heard that the Person you sent down to take an account of the Coals was bribed by Deardin , and did not give an account of half of what was got . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : For Mrs. Massingberd , see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 100 , at end of ` note ' 3 [ Footnote 1 of Letter 52 ] .
Byron 's pecuniary transactions , though not unimportant in their influence on his career , are difficult to unravel .
The following statement , in his own handwriting , with regard to the Annuities was apparently prepared for some legal proceedings , and is dated January 16 , 1812 :


`` Lord Byron , to the best of his knowledge and recollection , in Dec. , 1805 -- January , 1806 applied to King , in consequence of an advertisement in the papers , who acquainted Lord Byron that his minority prevented all money transactions without the security of competent persons .
Through Mr. K. he became acquainted with Mr. Dellevelly , another of the tribe of Israel , and subsequently with a Mr. Howard of Golden Square .


`` After many delays , during which Lord B. had interviews with Howard , once , he thinks , in Golden Square , but more frequently in Piccadilly , Mrs. M [ assingberd ] agreed to become security jointly with her daughter .
Lord B. knows Howard 's person perfectly well , has not seen him subsequent to the transaction , but recollects Howard 's mentioning to him that he , Lord B. , was acting imprudently , stating that he made it a rule to advise young men against such proceedings .
Lord B. recollects , on the day on which the money was paid , that he remained in the next room till the papers were signed , Mrs. M [ assingberd ] having stated that the parties wished him to be kept out of sight during the business , and wished to avoid even mentioning his name .
Mrs. M [ assingberd ] deducted the interest for two years and a half , and L100 for Howard 's papers . ''


Two other Annuities were effected , in both of which Mrs. Massingberd figured as a security , and in one the manager of Dorant 's Hotel .
It was the interest on these minority loans which crippled Byron .
Two were still unpaid in 1817 . ]

Cheltenham , Oct. 18 , 1812 ,


Dear Sir , -- Will you have the goodness to get this Parody of a peculiar kind [ 1 ] ( for all the first lines are Busby 's entire ) , inserted in several of the papers ( correctly -- and copied correctly  my hand is difficult ) -- particularly the ` Morning Chronicle ' ?
Tell Mr. Perry I forgive him all he has said , and may say against my address , but he will allow me to deal with the Doctor -- ( audi alteram partem ) -- and not betray me .
I can not think what has befallen Mr. Perry , for of yore we were very good friends  -- but no matter , only get this inserted .


I have a poem on Waltzing for you , of which I make you a present  but it must be anonymous .
It is in the old style of ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ' .


Ever yours ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- With the next edition of ` Childe Harold ' you may print the first fifty or a hundred opening lines of the ` Curse of Minerva ' [ 2 ] down to the couplet beginning


Mortal ( 't was thus she spake ) , etc. .


Of course , the moment the Satire begins , there you will stop , and the opening is the best part .


[ Footnote 1 : The ` Parenthetical Address ' , `` By Dr. Plagiary , '' is a parody by Byron of Dr , Busby 's ` Address ' , the original of which will be found in the ` Genuine Rejected Addresses ' , as well as parodied in ` Rejected Addresses ' ( `` Architectural Atoms '' ) .
On October 14 young Busby forced his way on to the stage of Drury Lane , attempted to recite his father 's address , and was taken into custody .
On the next night , Dr. Busby , speaking from one of the boxes , obtained a hearing for his son , who could not , however , make his voice heard in the theatre .
Then another `` rejected '' author tried to recite his composition , but was hooted down .
Order was restored by Raymond reminding the audience that the Chamberlain 's licence was necessary for all stage speeches .
To the failure of the younger Busby ( himself a competitor and the author of an `` Unalogue '' of fifty-six lines ) to make himself heard , Byron alludes in the stage direction to the ` Parenthetical Address ' -- `` to be spoken in an inarticulate voice by Master P. '' The ` Parenthetical Address ' appeared in the ` Morning Chronicle ' for October 23 , 1812 .
In the same issue was printed a long statement by Dr. Busby , in which , after paying a compliment to Byron 's `` poetical genius , '' he insisted that the Committee of Drury Lane had broken faith by not choosing one of the addresses sent in by competitors .
( See references to Dr. Busby in ` Poems ' , vol .
i. pp. 481 and 485 , ` note ' 1 . )
Dr. Thomas Busby ( 1755-1838 ) composed the music for Holcroft 's ` Tale of Mystery ' , the first musical melodrama produced on the English stage ( Covent Garden , November 13 , 1802 ) .
He was for some time assistant editor of the ` Morning Post ' , and Parliamentary reporter for the ` London Courant '  wrote on musical subjects , taught languages and music , and translated Lucretius into rhymed verse ( 1813 ) . ]


[ Footnote 2 : ` The Curse of Minerva , ' written at Athens , in 1811 , was not published as a whole till 1828 .
But the first fifty-four lines appeared in Canto III .
of ` The Corsair ' ( 1814 ) .

Dear Sir , -- Many thanks , but I must pay the ` damage ' , and will thank you to tell me the amount for the engraving .
I think the ` Rejected Addresses ' by far the best thing of the kind since the ` Rolliad ' , and wish you had published them .
Tell the author `` I forgive him , were be twenty times our satirist  '' and think his imitations not at all inferior to the famous ones of Hawkins Browne .
He must be a man of very lively wit , and much less scurrilous than Wits often are : altogether , I very much admire the performance , and wish it all success .
The ` Satirist ' has taken a new tone , as you will see : we have now , I think , finished with ` C. H. 's ' critics .
I have in ` hand ' a ` Satire ' on ` Waltzing ' , which you must publish anonymously : it is not long , not quite 200 lines , but will make a very small boarded pamphlet .

It is rather above 200 lines , with an introductory letter to the Publisher .
I think of publishing , with ` C. H.

between ourselves , it was unlike the picture  and besides , upon the whole , the frontispiece of an author 's visage is but a paltry exhibition .
At all events , this would have been no recommendation to the book .
I am sure Sanders would not have survived the engraving .
By the by , the picture may remain with you or him ( which you please ) , till my return .
The one of two remaining copies is at your service till I can give you a better  the other must be burned peremptorily .
Again , do not forget that I have an account with you , and that this is included .
I give you too much TROUBLE to allow you to incur EXPENSE also .


You best know how far this `` Address Riot '' will affect the future sale of ` C. H. ' I like the volume of `` rejected A. '' better and better .
The other parody which Perry has received is mine also ( I believe ) .
It is Dr. Busby 's speech versified .
You are removing to Albemarle Street , I find , and I rejoice that we shall be nearer neighbours .
I am going to Lord Oxford 's , but letters here will be forwarded .
When at leisure , all communications from you will be willingly received by the humblest of your scribes .

31st , 1812 .


DEAR SIR , -- The inclosed bill [ 1 ] will convince you how anxious I must be for the payment of Claughton 's first instalment  though it has been sent in without due notice , I can not blame Mr. Davies who must feel very anxious to get rid of the business .
Press C. , and let me have an answer whenever you can to this Place .


Yours ever ,


B .


P.S. -- I am at Lord Oxford 's , Eywood , as above .


[ Footnote 1 : The bill was Byron 's for L1500 , and the enclosure ran as follows :


`` Lord Byron .


`` A Bill for L1500 , drawn by Scrope B. Davies , lies due at Sir James Esdaile and Co 's .
, No. 21 , Lombard-Street .


`` All Drafts intended for the Payment of Bills , to be brought before Half past Three o'Clock .


`` Please to call between 3 and Five o'Clock . ''


The same day Byron writes a second letter to Hanson :


`` Do pray press Claughton , as Mr. D. 's business must be settled at all events .
I send you his letter , and I am more uncomfortable than I can possibly express myself upon the subject .
Pray write . '' ]

DEAR SIR , -- Not being able ( and to-day being Sunday also ) to procure a stamp , as the Post town is very remote , I must request this letter to be considered as an Order for paying fifteen hundred pounds to S.B. Davies , Esq. , and the same sum to your own account for the Tythe purchase .
Mr. D. 's receipt can be indorsed on the bond .


I shall be in London the latter end of the week .
I set out from this place on the 12th .
As to Mr. C. , the Law must decide between us  I shall abide by the Contract .
Your answer will not reach me in time , so do not write to me while here .


Pray let Mr. D. be paid and you also -- come what may .
[ 1 ] I always foresaw that C. would shirk  but he did it with his eyes open .
What question can arise as to the title ?
has it never been examined ?
I never heard of it before , and surely , in all our law suits , that question must have come to issue .


I hope we shall meet in town .
I will wait on you the moment I arrive .


My best respects to your family  believe me , Ever yours sincerely ,


BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Byron was prepared to make some sacrifices to extricate himself from debt , or go abroad .
The following letter to Hanson is dated December 10 , 1812 :


`` DEAR SIR , -- I have to request that you will pay the bearer ( my Groom ) the wages due to him ( 12 pds .

, and dismiss him immediately , as I have given up my horses , and place the sum to my account .

Four days later , December 14 , 1812 , he writes again to Hanson :


`` DEAR SIR , -- I request your attention to the enclosed .

DEAR SIR , -- The floods having rendered the road impassable , I am detained here , but trust by the latter end of the week to proceed to Cheltenham , where I shall expect a letter from you to tell me if I am wanted in town .


I shall not be in time for the Prince 's address  but I wish you to write down for my Parliamentary robes ( Mrs. Chaworth had them , at least Mrs. Clarke the mother )  though I rather think those were the Coronation and not the House robes .
At least enquire .


I hope Mr. D. is paid  and , if Mr. C. demurs , we must bring an action according to Contract .


I trust you are well , and well doing in my behalf and your own .

-- To John Murray .


Cheltenham , November 22 , 1812 .


DEAR SIR , -- On my return here from Lord Oxford 's , I found your obliging note , and will thank you to retain the letters , and any other subsequent ones to the same address , till I arrive in town to claim them , which will probably be in a few days .
I have in charge a curious and very long MS. poem , written by Lord Brooke ( the friend of Sir Philip Sidney ) , which I wish to submit to the inspection of Mr. Gifford , with the following queries : -- first , whether it has ever been published , and secondly ( if not ) , whether it is worth publication ?
It is from Lord Oxford 's Library , and must have escaped or been overlooked amongst the MSS .
of the Harleian Miscellany .
The writing is Lord Brooke 's , except a different hand towards the close .
It is very long , and in the six-line stanza .
It is not for me to hazard an opinion upon its merits  but I would take the Liberty , if not too troublesome , to submit it to Mr. Gifford 's judgment , which , from his excellent edition of Massinger , I should conceive to be as decisive on the writings of that age as on those of our own .


Now for a less agreeable and important topic .
-- How came Mr. Mac-Somebody [ 1 ] , without consulting you or me , to prefix the Address to his volume of `` dejected addresses ? ''
Is not this somewhat larcenous ?
I think the ceremony of leave might have been asked , though I have no objection to the thing itself  and leave the `` hundred and eleven '' to tire themselves with `` base comparisons . ''
I should think the ingenuous public tolerably sick of the subject , and , except the parodies , I have not interfered , nor shall  indeed I did not know that Dr. Busby had published his apologetical letter and postscript [ 2 ] , or I should have recalled them .
But , I confess , I looked upon his conduct in a different light before its appearance .
I see some mountebank has taken Alderman Birch 's name [ 3 ] to vituperate the Doctor  he had much better have pilfered his pastry , which I should imagine the more valuable ingredient -- at least for a Puff .
-- Pray secure me a copy of Woodfall 's new ` Junius ' [ 4 ] ,


and believe me ,


Dear Sir , yours very sincerely ,


B .

December 26 , [ 1812 ] .


The multitude of your recommendations has already superseded my humble endeavours to be of use to you  and , indeed , most of my principal friends are returned , Leake from Joannina , Canning and Adair from the city of the Faithful , and at Smyrna no letter is necessary , as the consuls are always willing to do every thing for personages of respectability .
I have sent you three  one to Gibraltar , which , though of no great necessity , will , perhaps , put you on a more intimate footing with a very pleasant family there .
You will very soon find out that a man of any consequence has very little occasion for any letters but to ministers and bankers , and of them we have already plenty , I will be sworn .


It is by no means improbable that I shall go in the spring  and if you will fix any place of rendezvous about August , I will write or join you .
-- When in Albania , I wish you would inquire after Dervise Tahiri and Vascillie ( or Bazil ) , and make my respects to the viziers , both there and in the Morea .
If you mention my name to Suleyman of Thebes , I think it will not hurt you  if I had my dragoman , or wrote Turkish , I could have given you letters of real service  but to the English they are hardly requisite , and the Greeks themselves can be of little advantage .
Liston [ 1 ] you know already , and I do not , as he was not then minister .
Mind you visit Ephesus and the Troad , and let me hear from you when you please .
I believe G. Forresti is now at Yanina  but if not , whoever is there will be too happy to assist you .
Be particular about firmauns  never allow yourself to be bullied , for you are better protected in Turkey than any where  trust not the Greeks  and take some knicknackeries for presents -- watches , pistols , etc. , etc. , to the Beys and Pachas .
If you find one Demetrius , at Athens or elsewhere , I can recommend him as a good dragoman .
I hope to join you , however  but you will find swarms of English now in the Levant .

Eywood , Presteign , January 8 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- You have been imposed upon by a letter forged in my name to obtain the picture left in your possession .
This I know by the confession of the culprit [ 1 ] and as she is a woman ( and of rank ) , with whom I have unfortunately been too much connected , you will for the present say very little about it  but if you have the letter retain it -- write to me the particulars .
You will also be more cautious in future , and not allow anything of mine to pass from your hands without my Seal as well as Signature .


I have not been in town , nor have written to you since I left it .
So I presume the forgery was a skilful performance .
-- I shall endeavour to get back the picture by fair means , if possible .


Yours ever ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- Keep the letter if you have it .
I did not receive your parcel , and it is now too late to send it on , as I shall be in town on the 17th .
The delinquent is one of the first families in this kingdom  but , as Dogberry says , this is `` flat burglary . ''
[ 2 ]


Favour me with an answer .
I hear I am scolded in the ` Quarterly '  but you and it are already forgiven .
I suppose that made you bashful about sending it .

-- To Francis Hodgson .


February 3 , 1813 .


My Dear Hodgson , -- I will join you in any bond for the money you require , be it that or a larger sum .
With regard to security , as Newstead is in a sort of abeyance between sale and purchase , and my Lancashire property very unsettled , I do not know how far I can give more than personal security , but what I can I will .
At any rate you can try , and as the sum is not very considerable , the chances are favourable .
I hear nothing of my own concerns , but expect a letter daily .
Let me hear from you where you are and will be this month .
I am a great admirer of the ` R. A. ' [ ` Rejected Addresses ' ] , though I have had so great a share in the cause of their publication , and I like the ` C. H. ' [ ` Childe Harold ' ] imitation one of the best .
[ 1 ] Lady Oxford has heard me talk much of you as a relative of the Cokes , etc. , and desires me to say she would be happy to have the pleasure of your acquaintance .
You must come and see me at K [ insham ] .
I am sure you would like all here if you knew them .


The `` Agnus '' is furious .
You can have no idea of the horrible and absurd things she has said and done [ 2 ] since ( really from the best motives ) I withdrew my homage .
`` Great pleasure '' is , certes , my object , but `` why brief , Mr. Wild ? ''
[ 3 ] I can not answer for the future , but the past is pretty secure  and in it I can number the last two months as worthy of the gods in ` Lucretius ' .
I can not review in the `` Monthly  '' in fact I can just now do nothing , at least with a pen  and I really think the days of Authorship are over with me altogether .
I hear and rejoice in Eland 's and Merivale 's intentions [ 4 ] .


Murray has grown great , and has got him new premises in the fashionable part of the town [ 5 ] .


We live here so shut out of the monde that I have nothing of general import to communicate , and fill this up with a `` happy new year , '' and drink to you and Drury .


Ever yours , dear H. , B .


I have no intention of continuing `` Childe Harold . ''
There are a few additions in the `` body of the book '' of description , which will merely add to the number of pages in the next edition .
I have taken Kinsham Court .
The business of last summer I broke off [ 6 ] , and now the amusement of the gentle fair is writing letters literally threatening my life , and much in the style of `` Miss Mathews '' in `` Amelia , '' or `` Lucy '' in the `` Beggar 's Opera . ''
Such is the reward of restoring a woman to her family , who are treating her with the greatest kindness , and with whom I am on good terms .
I am still in palatia Circes , and , being no Ulysses , can not tell into what animal I may be converted  as you are aware of the turn of both parties , your conjectures will be very correct , I daresay , and , seriously , I am very much attached .
She has had her share of the denunciations of the brilliant Phryne , and regards them as much as I do .
I hope you will visit me at K. which will not be ready before spring , and I am very sure you would like my neighbours if you knew them .
If you come down now to Kington [ 7 ] , pray come and see me .

`` Byron often talks of the authors of the ` Rejected Addresses ' , and always in terms of unqualified praise .
He says that the imitations , unlike all other imitations , are full of genius .
` Parodies , ' he said , ` always give a bad impression of the original , but in the ` Rejected Addresses ' the reverse was the fact  ' and he quoted the second and third stanzas , in imitation of himself , as admirable , and just what he could have wished to write on a similar subject ''

My aunt looks stout and well , but poor Caroline most terribly the contrary .
She is worn to the bone , as pale as death and her eyes starting out of her head .
She seems indeed in a sad way , alternately in tearing spirits and in tears .
I hate her character , her feelings , and herself when I am away from her , but she interests me when I am with her , and to see her poor careworn face is dismal , in spite of reason and speculation upon her extraordinary conduct .
She appears to me in a state very ( little ) short of insanity , and my aunt describes it as at times having been decidedly so . '' ]

Dear Sir , -- In `` Horace in London '' [ 1 ] I perceive some stanzas on Lord Elgin in which ( waving the kind compliment to myself [ 2 ] ) I heartily concur .
I wish I had the pleasure of Mr. Smith 's acquaintance , as I could communicate the curious anecdote you read in Mr. T. 's letter .
If he would like it , he can have the substance for his second Edition  if not , I shall add it to our next , though I think we already have enough of Lord Elgin .


What I have read of this work seems admirably done .
My praise , however , is not much worth the Author 's having  but you may thank him in my name for his .
The idea is new -- we have excellent imitations of the Satires , etc. by Pope  but I remember but one imitative Ode in his works , and none any where else .
I can hardly suppose that they have lost any fame by the fate of the Farce [ 3 ]  but even should this be the case , the present publication will again place them on their pinnacle .


Yours truly ,

I feel rather surprised to have heard nothing from you or your father in answer to Fletcher 's last letter .
I wish to know whether you intend taking a share in a farm with your brother , or prefer to wait for some other situation in Lancashire  -- the first will be the best , because , at your time of life , it is highly improper to remain idle .
If this marriage which is spoken of for you is at all advantageous , I can have no objection  but I should suppose , after being in my service from your infancy , you will at least let me know the name of your intended , and her expectations .
If at all respectable , nothing can be better for your settlement in life , and a proper provision will be made for you  at all events let me hear something on the subject , for , as I have some intention of leaving England in the Summer , I wish to make my arrangements with regard to yourself before that period .
As you and Mr. Murray have not received any money for some time , if you will draw on me for fifty pounds ( payable at Messrs. Hoare 's , Bankers , Fleet Street ) , and tell Mr. J [ oseph ] Murray to draw for the same sum on his own account , both will be paid by me .

It is my determination , on account of a malady to which I am subject , and for other weighty reasons , to go abroad again almost immediately .
To this you will object  but , as my intention can not be altered , I have only to request that you will assist me as far as in your power to make the necessary arrangements .


I have every confidence in you , and will leave the fullest powers to act in my absence .
If this man still hesitates , I must sell my part of Rochdale for what it will bring , even at a loss , and fight him out about Newstead  without this , I have no funds to go on with , and I do not wish to incur further debts if possible .


Pray favour me with a short reply to this , and say when I can see you .

A person told me yesterday there was one who would give within 10000 of C. 's price and take the title as it was .
C. is a fool or is shuffling .


Think of what I said about Rochdale , for I will sell it for what I can get , and will not stay three months longer in this country .

Dear Sir , -- Lady F [ alkland ? ]
has returned by Mr. Hanson the only two letters I ever wrote her , both some time ago , and neither containing the least allusion which could make any person suppose that I had any intention further than regards the children of her husband .
My servant returned the packet and letter of yesterday at the moment of receiving them  by her letter to Mr. H. it should seem they have not been redelivered .
I am sorry for this , but it is not my fault , and they ought never to have been sent .
After her Ladyship 's mistakes , so often repeated , you will not blame me for declining all further interference in her affairs , and I rely much upon your word in contradicting her foolish assertions , and most absurd imaginations .
She now says that `` I need not leave the country on her account . ''
How the devil she knew that I was about to leave it I can not guess  but , however , for the first time she has dreamed right .
But her being the cause is still more ludicrous than the rest .
First , she would have it that I returned here for love of a woman I never saw , and now that I am going , for the same whom I have never seen , and certainly never wished , nor wish , to see !
The maddest consistency I ever heard of .
I trust that she has regained her senses , as she tells Mr. H. she will not scribble any more , which will also save you from the troublesome correspondence of

Mh .
24th , 1813 .


My Dear Charles , -- This is very evasive and dissatisfactory .
What is to be done I can not tell , but your father had better see his letter and this of mine .
A long litigation neither suits my inclination nor circumstances  it were better to take back the estate , and raise it to what it will bear , which must be at least double , to dismantle the house and sell the materials , and sell Rochdale .
Something I must determine on and that quickly .
I want to go abroad immediately  it is utterly impossible for me to remain here  every thing I have done to extricate myself has been useless .
Your father said `` sell  '' I have sold , and see what has become of it !
If I go to Law with this fellow , after five years litigation at the present depreciation of money , the price will not be worth the property  besides how much of it will be spent in the contest !
and how am I to live in the interim ?
Every day land rises and money falls .
I shall tell Mr. Cn .
he is a scoundrel , and have done with him , and I only hope he will have spirit enough to resent the appellation , and defend his own rascally conduct .
In the interim of his delay in his journey , I shall leave town  on Sunday I shall set out for Herefordshire , from whence , when wanted , I will return .


Pray tell your father to get the money on Rochdale , or I must sell it directly .
I must be ready by the last week in May , and am consequently pressed for time .


I go first to Cagliari in Sardinia , and on to the Levant .


Believe me , dear Charles ,

[ 1 ]


March 25 , 1813 .


I enclose you a draft for the usurious interest due to Lord B [ oringdon ] 's protege  -- I also could wish you would state thus much for me to his Lordship .
Though the transaction speaks plainly in itself for the borrower 's folly and the lender 's usury , it never was my intention to quash the demand , as I legally might , nor to withhold payment of principal , or , perhaps , even unlawful interest .
You know what my situation has been , and what it is .
I have parted with an estate ( which has been in my family for nearly three hundred years , and was never disgraced by being in possession of a lawyer , a churchman , or a woman , during that period , ) to liquidate this and similar demands  and the payment of the purchase is still withheld , and may be , perhaps , for years .
If , therefore , I am under the necessity of making those persons wait for their money , ( which , considering the terms , they can afford to suffer , ) it is my misfortune .


When I arrived at majority in 1809,1 offered my own security on legal interest , and it was refused .
Now , I will not accede to this .
This man I may have seen , but I have no recollection of the names of any parties but the agents and the securities .
The moment I can , it is assuredly my intention to pay my debts .
This person 's case may be a hard one  but , under all circumstances , what is mine ?
I could not foresee that the purchaser of my estate was to demur in paying for it .


I am glad it happens to be in my power so far to accommodate my Israelite , and only wish I could do as much for the rest of the Twelve Tribes .


Ever yours , dear R. ,

My Dearest Augusta , -- I did not answer your letter , because I could not answer as I wished , but expected that every week would bring me some tidings that might enable me to reply better than by apologies .
But Claughton has not , will not , and , I think , can not pay his money , and though , luckily , it was stipulated that he should never have possession till the whole was paid , the estate is still on my hands , and your brother consequently not less embarrassed than ever .
This is the truth , and is all the excuse I can offer for inability , but not unwillingness , to serve you .


I am going abroad again in June , but should wish to see you before my departure .
You have perhaps heard that I have been fooling away my time with different `` regnantes  '' but what better can be expected from me ?
I have but one relative , and her I never see .
I have no connections to domesticate with , and for marriage I have neither the talent nor the inclination .
I can not fortune-hunt , nor afford to marry without a fortune .
My parliamentary schemes are not much to my taste -- I spoke twice last Session , [ 1 ] and was told it was well enough  but I hate the thing altogether , and have no intention to `` strut another hour '' on that stage .
I am thus wasting the best part of life , daily repenting and never amending .


On Sunday , I set off for a fortnight for Eywood , near Presteign , in Herefordshire -- with the Oxfords .
I see you put on a demure look at the name , which is very becoming and matronly in you  but you wo n't be sorry to hear that I am quite out of a more serious scrape with another singular personage which threatened me last year , and trouble enough I had to steer clear of it I assure you .
I hope all my nieces are well , and increasing in growth and number  but I wish you were not always buried in that bleak common near Newmarket .


I am very well in health , but not happy , nor even comfortable  but I will not bore you with complaints .
I am a fool , and deserve all the ills I have met , or may meet with , but nevertheless very sensibly , dearest Augusta ,


Your most affectionate brother , BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : What is generally supposed to have been Byron 's second speech ( see Appendix II .
( 2 ) ) was made , April 21 , 1813 , on Lord Donoughmore 's motion for a Committee on Roman Catholic claims .


The following impressions of his short parliamentary career are recorded by Byron himself :


`` I have never heard any one who fulfilled my ideal of an orator .
Grattan would have been near it , but for his harlequin delivery .
Pitt I never heard .
Fox but once , and then he struck me as a debater , which to me seems as different from an orator as an improvisatore , or a versifier , from a poet .
Grey is great , but it is not oratory .
Canning is sometimes very like one .
Windham I did not admire , though all the world did  it seemed sad sophistry .
Whitbread was the Demosthenes of bad taste and vulgar vehemence , but strong , and English .
Holland is impressive from sense and sincerity .
Lord Lansdowne good , but still a debater only .
Grenville I like vastly , if he would prune his speeches down to an hour 's delivery .
Burdett is sweet and silvery as Belial himself , and I think the greatest favourite in Pandemonium  at least I always heard the country gentlemen and the ministerial devilry praise his speeches up stairs , and run down from Bellamy 's when he was upon his legs .
I heard Bob Milnes make his second speech  it made no impression .
I like Ward -- studied , but keen , and sometimes eloquent .
Peel , my school and form fellow ( we sat within two of each other ) , strange to say , I have never heard , though I often wished to do so  but , from what I remember of him at Harrow , he is , or should be , among the best of them .
Now I do not admire Mr. Wilberforce 's speaking  it is nothing but a flow of words -- ` words , words , alone . '


`` I doubt greatly if the English have any eloquence , properly so called  and am inclined to think that the Irish had a great deal , and that the French will have , and have had in Mirabeau .
Lord Chatham and Burke are the nearest approaches to orators in England .
I do n't know what Erskine may have been at the bar , but in the House , I wish him at the bar once more .
Lauderdale is shrill , and Scotch , and acute .
Of Brougham I shall say nothing , as I have a personal feeling of dislike to the man .


`` But amongst all these , good , bad , and indifferent , I never heard the speech which was not too long for the auditors , and not very intelligible , except here and there .
The whole thing is a grand deception , and as tedious and tiresome as maybe to those who must be often present .
I heard Sheridan only once , and that briefly , but I liked his voice , his manner , and his wit : and he is the only one of them I ever wished to hear at greater length .


`` The impression of Parliament upon me was , that its members are not formidable as speakers , but very much so as an audience  because in so numerous a body there may be little eloquence , ( after all , there were but two thorough orators in all antiquity , and I suspect still fewer in modern times , ) but there must be a leaven of thought and good sense sufficient to make them know what is right , though they ca n't express it nobly .


`` Horne Tooke and Roscoe both are said to have declared that they left Parliament with a higher opinion of its aggregate integrity and abilities than that with which they entered it .
The general amount of both in most Parliaments is probably about the same , as also the number of speakers and their talent .
I except orators , of course , because they are things of ages , and not of septennial or triennial reunions .
Neither House ever struck me with more awe or respect than the same number of Turks in a divan , or of Methodists in a barn , would have done .
Whatever diffidence or nervousness I felt ( and I felt both , in a great degree ) arose from the number rather than the quality of the assemblage , and the thought rather of the public without than the persons within , -- knowing ( as all know ) that Cicero himself , and probably the Messiah , could never have altered the vote of a single lord of the bedchamber , or bishop .
I thought our House dull , but the other animating enough upon great days .


`` I have heard that when Grattan made his first speech in the English Commons , it was for some minutes doubtful whether to laugh at or cheer him .
The debut of his predecessor , Flood , had been a complete failure , under nearly similar circumstances .
But when the ministerial part of our senators had watched Pitt ( their thermometer ) for the cue , and saw him nod repeatedly his stately nod of approbation , they took the hint from their huntsman , and broke out into the most rapturous cheers .
Grattan 's speech , indeed , deserved them  it was a chef-d'oeuvre .
I did not hear that speech of his ( being then at Harrow ) , but heard most of his others on the same question -- also that on the war of 1815 .
I differed from his opinions on the latter question , but coincided in the general admiration of his eloquence .


`` When I met old Courtenay , the orator , at Rogers 's the poet 's , in 1811-12 , I was much taken with the portly remains of his fine figure , and the still acute quickness of his conversation .
It was he who silenced Flood in the English House by a crushing reply to a hasty debut of the rival of Grattan in Ireland .
I asked Courtenay ( for I like to trace motives ) if he had not some personal provocation  for the acrimony of his answer seemed to me , as I read it , to involve it .
Courtenay said ` he had  that , when in Ireland ( being an Irishman ) , at the bar of the Irish House of Commons , Flood had made a personal and unfair attack upon himself , who , not being a member of that House , could not defend himself , and that some years afterwards , the opportunity of retort offering in the English Parliament , he could not resist it . '
He certainly repaid Flood with interest , for Flood never made any figure , and only a speech or two afterwards , in the English House of Commons .
I must except , however , his speech on Reform in 1790 , which Fox called ` the best he ever heard upon that subject . ' '' ]

Now , having arrived , I shall write to that person immediately to give up the whole business .
I am sick of the delays attending it , and can wait no longer , and I have had too much of law already at Rochdale to place Newstead in the same predicament .


I shall only be able to see you for a few days in town , as I shall sail before the 20th of May .

I wish , if possible , the arrangement with Hoare to be made immediately , as I must set off forthwith .
I mean to remain incog .
in London for the short time previous to my embarkation .


I have not written to Claughton , nor shall , of course , after your counsel on the subject .
I wish you would turn in your mind the expediency of selling Rochdale .
I shall never make any thing of it , as it is .


I beg you will provide ( as before my last voyage ) the fullest powers to act in my absence , and bring my cursed concerns into some kind of order .
You must at least allow that I have acted according to your advice about Newstead , and I shall take no step without your being previously consulted .


I hope I shall find you and Mrs. H. , etc. , well in London , and that you have heard something from this dilatory gentleman .

I wish you to have Sanders 's taken down and sent to my lodgings immediately -- before my arrival .
I hear that a certain malicious publication on Waltzing [ 2 ] is attributed to me .
This report , I suppose , you will take care to contradict , as the Author , I am sure , will not like that I should wear his cap and bells .
Mr. Hobhouse 's quarto will be out immediately  pray send to the author for an early copy which I wish to take abroad with me .


Dear Sir , I am , yours very truly , B .


P.S. -- I see the ` Examiner ' [ 3 ] threatens some observations upon you next week .
What can you have done to share the wrath which has heretofore been principally expended upon the Prince ?

He supported himself by his pen , and that indifferently .
Byron seems to suggest that he was a dependent of Murray 's .
In 1817 he sent to the Committee of Management at Drury Lane his tragedy , ` The Italians  or , the Fatal Accusation ' , and it was accepted .
In February , 1819 , he withdrew the play , in consequence of a quarrel with Edmund Kean , and published it with extracts from the correspondence and a Preface , which sent it through numerous editions .
The play itself was , after being withdrawn , played at Drury Lane , April 3 , 1819 .
Bucke and his Preface were answered in ` The Assailant Assailed ' , and in ' A Defence of Edmund Kean , Esq ' .
( both in 1819 ) , and the opinion of the town condemned both him and his tragedy . ]

[ Footnote 1 : Moore 's ` Intercepted Letters , or the Twopenny Post-bag .
By Thomas Brown , the Younger ' , was published in 1813 . ]


[ Footnote 2 : The `` wit in the dungeon '' was James Henry Leigh Hunt ( 1784-1859 ) , who was educated at Christ 's Hospital , and began his literary life with `` a collection of poems , written between the ages of twelve and sixteen , '' and published in 1801 as ` Juvenilia ' .
In 1808 he and his brother John started a weekly newspaper called the ` Examiner ' , which advocated liberal principles with remarkable independence .
On February 24 , 1811 , Hunt published an article in defence of Peter Finnerty , convicted for a libel on Castlereagh , and exhorting public writers to be bold in the cause of individual liberty .
The same number contained an article on the savagery of military floggings , for which he was prosecuted , defended by Brougham , and acquitted .
His acquittal drew from Shelley a letter of congratulation , addressed to Hunt as `` one of the most fearless enlighteners of the public mind '' ( Dowden 's ` Life of Shelley ' , vol .
i. p. 113 ) .


In March , 1812 , the ` Morning Post ' printed a poem , speaking of the Prince Regent as the `` Maecenas of the Age , '' the `` Exciter of Desire , '' the `` Glory of the People , '' an `` Adonis of Loveliness , '' etc. .
The ` Examiner ' for March 12 , 1812 , thus translated this adulation into `` the language of truth : ''


`` What person , unacquainted with the true state of the case , would imagine , in reading these astounding eulogies , that this ` Glory of the People ' was the subject of millions of shrugs and reproaches !
... that this ` Exciter of Desire ' ( bravo !
Messieurs of the ` Post ' ! )
, this ` Adonis in Loveliness , ' was a corpulent man of fifty !
-- in short , this ` delightful , blissful , wise , pleasureable , honourable , virtuous , true ' , and ` immortal ' prince was a violator of his word , a libertine over head and ears in disgrace , a despiser of domestic ties , the companion of gamblers and demireps , a man who has just closed half a century without one single claim on the gratitude of his country or the respect of posterity . ''


Crabb Robinson , who met Leigh Hunt , four days later , at Charles Lamb 's , says ( ` Diary ' , vol .
i. p. 376 ) ,


`` Leigh Hunt is an enthusiast , very well intentioned , and , I believe , prepared for the worst .
He said , pleasantly enough , ` No one can accuse me of not writing a libel .
Everything is a libel , as the law is now declared , and our security lies only in their shame . ' ''


For this libel John and Leigh Hunt were convicted in the Court of King 's Bench on December 9 , 1812 .
In the following February they were sentenced to two years ' imprisonment and a fine of L500 a-piece .
John was imprisoned in Coldbath-fields , Leigh in the Surrey County Gaol .
They were released on February 2 or 3 , 1815 .


Shelley , on reading the sentence , proposed a subscription for


`` the brave and enlightened man ... to whom the public owes a debt as the champion of their liberties and virtues ''


( Dowden , ` Life of Shelley ' , vol .
i. p. 325 ) .
Keats wrote a sonnet to Hunt on the day he left his prison , beginning :


`` What though for showing truth to flatter'd state , Kind Hunt was shut in prison . ''


A political alliance was thus cemented , which , for the time , was disastrous to the literary prospects of Shelley and Keats .
To Hunt Shelley dedicated the ` Cenci ' , and Keats his first volume of ` Poems ' ( 1817 ) .
He is the `` gentlest of the wise '' in Shelley 's ` Adonais '  and , in a suppressed stanza of the same poem , the poet speaks of Hunt 's `` sweet and earnest looks , '' `` soft smiles , '' and `` dark and night-like eyes . ''
The words inscribed on Shelley 's tomb -- `` Cor Cordium '' -- were Hunt 's choice .
In his various papers Hunt zealously championed his friends .
In the ` Examiner ' for September to October , 1819 , he defended Shelley 's personal character  in the same paper for June to July , 1817 , he praised Keats 's first volume of ` Poems '  he reviewed `` Lamia '' in the ` Indicator ' for August 2-9 , 1820 , and `` La Belle Dame sans Merci '' in that for May 10 , 1820 .
In his ` Foliage ' ( 1818 ) are three sonnets addressed to Keats .


Shelley believed in Hunt to the end .
It was mainly through him that Hunt came to Pisa in June , 1822 , to join with Byron in ` The Liberal ' .
But he doubted whether the alliance between the `` wren and the eagle '' could continue ( ` Life of Shelley ' , vol .
ii .
p. 519 ) .
Keats , on the other hand , lost his faith in Hunt .
In a letter to Haydon ( May , 1817 ) , speaking of Hunt , he says ,


`` There is no greater Sin after the seven deadly than to flatter oneself into an idea of being a great Poet . ''


Again ( March , 1818 ) he writes ,


`` It is a great Pity that People should , by associating themselves with the finest things , spoil them .
Hunt has damned Hampstead , and masks , and sonnets , and Italian tales . ''


He writes still more severely ( December , 1818-January , 1819 ) ,


`` If I were to follow my own inclinations , I should never meet any one of that set again , not even Hunt , who is certainly a pleasant fellow in the main when you are with him  but in reality he is vain , egotistical , and disgusting in matters of taste and morals .
Hunt does one harm by making fine things petty , and beautiful things hateful .
Through him I am indifferent to Mozart .
I care not for white Busts -- and many a glorious thing when associated with him becomes a nothing . ''


Haydon considered that Hunt was the `` great unhinger '' of Keats 's best dispositions ( ` Works of Keats ' , ed .
H.B. Forman , vol .
iv .
p. 359 )  and Severn attributes Keats 's temporary `` mawkishness '' to Hunt 's society ( ` ibid ' .
, p. 376 ) .


Nathaniel Hawthorne ( ` Our Old Home ' , p. 229 , ed .
1884 ) says of Hunt , and means it as high praise , that


`` there was not an English trait in him from head to foot -- morally , intellectually , or physically .
Beef , ale or stout , brandy or port-wine , entered not at all into his composition . ''


He was , in fact , a man of weak fibre , who allowed himself to sponge upon his friends , such as Talfourd , Haydon , and Shelley .
Though Dickens denied ( ` All the Year Round ' , Dec. 24 , 1859 ) that `` Harold Skimpole '' was intended for Hunt , the picture was recognized as a portrait .
On the other hand , Hunt was a man of kindly and genial disposition .


`` He loves everything , '' says Crabb Robinson ( ` Diary ' , vol .
ii .
p. 192 ) , `` he catches the sunny side of everything , and , excepting that he has a few polemical antipathies , finds everything beautiful . ''


In his essays , the best of which appeared in the ` Indicator ' ( 1819-21 ) , he communicates some of his own sense of enjoyment to those of his readers who are content to take him as he is .
His circle is limited  but in it his observation is minute and suggestive .
The Vale of Health is to him , in a degree proportioned to their respective powers , what the Temple was to Lamb .
His style is neat , pretty , and would be affected if it were not the man himself .
As a literary journalist , a dramatic critic , and an essayist , he has a place in literature .
His poetry is less successful  his affectations , innate vulgarity , and habit of pawing his subjects repel even those who are attracted by its sweetness .
Yet his ` Story of Rimini ' ( 1816 ) , which he dedicated to Byron , was admired in its day .
Byron , though he condemned its affected style , thought the poem a `` devilish good one . ''
Moore held the same opinion  and Jeffrey , writing to him May 28 , 1816 ( ` Memoirs , etc. , of Thomas Moon , ' vol .
ii .
p. 100 ) , says ,


`` I certainly shall not be ill-natured to ` Rimini ' .
It is very sweet and very lively in many places , and is altogether piquant , as being by far the best imitation of Chaucer and some of his Italian contemporaries that modern times have produced . ''


No two men could be more unlike than Byron and Hunt , or have less in common .
Yet , with a singular capacity for self-delusion , Hunt told his wife that the texture of Byron 's mind resembled his to a thread ( ` Correspondence of L. Hunt ' , vol .
i. p. 88 ) .
The friendship began in political sympathy  but two years later ( see Byron 's letter to Moore , June 1 , 1818 ) it had , on one side at least , cooled .
In June , 1822 , Hunt came to Pisa to launch The Liberal , with the aid of Shelley and Byron .
` The Liberal : Verse and Prose from the South ' , started in 1822 , lived through four numbers , and died in July , 1823 .
During that time Byron expressed to Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , p. 77 )


`` a very good opinion of the talents and principle of Mr. Hunt , though , as he said , ` our tastes are so opposite that we are totally unsuited to each other ... in short , we are more formed to be friends at a distance , than near . ' ''


For the best part of two years Hunt was Byron 's guest : he repaid his hospitality by publishing his ` Lord Byron and Some of his Contemporaries ' ( 1828 ) .
Though Lady Blessington said the book `` gave , in the main , a fair account '' of Byron ( Crabb Robinson 's ` Diary ' , vol .
iii .
p. 13 ) , its publication was a breach of honour .
As such it was justly attacked by Moore in `` The ` Living Dog ' and the ` Dead Lion ' '' :


`` Next week will be published ( as ` Lives ' are the rage ) The whole Reminiscences , wondrous and strange , Of a small puppy-dog , that lived once in the cage Of the late noble Lion at Exeter ` Change .


`` Though the dog is a dog of the kind they call ` sad , ' 'T is a puppy that much to good breeding pretends  And few dogs have such opportunities had Of knowing how Lions behave -- among friends .


`` How that animal eats , how he snores , how he drinks , Is all noted down by this Boswell so small  And 't is plain , from each sentence , the puppy-dog thinks That the Lion was no such great things after all .


`` Though he roared pretty well -- this the puppy allows -- It was all , he says , borrowed -- all second-hand roar  And he vastly prefers his own little bow-wows To the loftiest war-note the Lion could pour .


'' 'T is , indeed , as good fun as a ` Cynic ' could ask , To see how this cockney-bred setter of rabbits Takes gravely the Lord of the Forest to task , And judges of Lions by puppy-dog habits .


`` Nay , fed as he was ( and this makes it a dark case ) With sops every day from the Lion 's own pan , He lifts up his leg at the noble beast 's carcass , And -- does all a dog , so diminutive , can .


`` However , the book 's a good book , being rich in Examples and warnings to lions high-bred , How they suffer small mongrelly curs in their kitchen , Who 'll feed on them living , and foul them when dead .

[ Footnote 3 : William Sotheby ( 1757-1833 ) , once a cavalry officer , afterwards a man of letters and of fortune , published his ` Oberon ' in 1798 , and his ` Georgics ' in 1800 ( see ` English Bards , etc. ' , line 818 , and ` note ' ) .
The following passage from Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' ( 1821 ) refers to him :


`` Sotheby is a good man  rhymes well ( if not wisely ) , but is a bore .
He seizes you by the button .
One night of a rout , at Mrs. Hope 's , he had fastened upon me ( something about Agamemnon or Orestes -- or some of his plays ) , notwithstanding my symptoms of manifest distress , ( for I was in love and had just nicked a minute when neither mothers , nor husbands , nor rivals , nor gossips , were near my then idol , who was beautiful as the Statues of the Gallery where we stood at the time ) .
Sotheby , I say , had seized upon me by the button , and the heart-strings , and spared neither .
W. Spencer , who likes fun , and do n't dislike mischief , saw my case , and , coming up to us both , took me by the hand and pathetically bade me farewell , ` for , ' said he , ' I see it is all over with you . '
Sotheby then went away .

June 3d , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- When you receive this I shall have left town for a week , and , as it is perfectly right we should understand each other , I think you will not be surprised at my persisting in my intention of going abroad .
If the Suit can be carried on in my absence , -- well  if not , it must be given up .
One word , one letter , to Cn .
would put an end to it  but this I shall not do , at all events without acquainting you before hand  nor at all , provided I am able to go abroad again .
But at all hazards , at all losses , on this last point I am as determined as I have been for the last six months , and you have always told me that you would endeavour to assist me in that intention .
Every thing is ordered and ready now .
Do not trifle with me , for I am in very solid serious earnest , and if utter ruin were , or is before me , on the one hand -- and wealth at home on the other , -- I have made my choice , and go I will .


If you wish to write , address a line before Saturday to Salthill Post Office  Maidenhead , I believe , but am not sure , is the Post town  but I shall not be in town till Wednesday next .


Believe me , yours ever ,


BN .


P.S. -- Let all the books go to Mr. Murray 's immediately , and let the plate , linen , etc. , which I find excepted by the contract , be sold , particularly a large silver vase -- with the contents not removed as they are curious , and a silver cup ( not the skull ) be sold also -- both are of value .


The Pictures also , and every moveable that is mine , and can be converted into cash  all I want is a few thousand pounds , and then adieu .
You sha n't be troubled with me these ten years , if ever .

MY DEAR HODGSON , -- I write to you a few lines on business .
Murray has thought proper at his own risk , and peril , and profit ( if there be any ) to publish ` The Giaour '  and it may possibly come under your ordeal in the ` Monthly ' [ 1 ] I merely wish to state that in the published copies there are additions to the amount of ten pages , text and margin ( chiefly the last ) , which render it a little less unfinished ( but more unintelligible ) than before .
If , therefore , you review it , let it be from the published copies and not from the first sketch .
I shall not sail for this month , and shall be in town again next week , when I shall be happy to hear from you but more glad to see you .
You know I have no time or turn for correspondence ( ! ) .
But you also know , I hope , that I am not the less


Yours ever ,

My dear Hodgson , -- In town for a night I find your card .
I had written to you at Cambridge merely to say that Murray has thought it expedient to publish ` The Giaour ' at his own risk ( and reimbursement , if he can ) , and that , as it will probably be in your department in the ` Monthly ' , I wished to state that , in the published copies , there are additions to the tune of 300 lines or so towards the end , and , if reviewed , it should not be from the privately printed copy .
So much for scribbling .


I shall manage to see you somewhere before I sail , which will be next month  till then I am yours here , and afterwards any where and every where ,

Dear Sir , -- Having occasion to send a servant to London , I will thank you to inform me whether I left with the other things 3 miniatures in your care ( -- if not -- I know where to find them ) , and also to `` report progress '' in unpacking the books ?
The bearer returns this evening .


How does Hobhouse 's work go on , or rather off -- for that is the essential part ?
In yesterday 's paper , immediately under an advertisement on `` Strictures in the Urethra , '' I see -- most appropriately consequent -- a poem with `` strictures on Ld B. , Mr. Southey and others , '' [ 1 ] though I am afraid neither `` Mr. S. 's '' poetical distemper , nor `` mine , '' nor `` others , '' is of the suppressive or stranguary kind .
You may read me the prescription of this kill or cure physician .
The medicine is compounded at White and Cochrane 's , Fleet Street .
As I have nothing else to do , I may enjoy it like Sir Fretful , or the Archbishop of Grenada , or any other personage in like predicament .


Recollect that my lacquey returns in the Evening , and that I set out for Portsmouth [ 2 ] to-morrow .
All here are very well , and much pleased with your politeness and attention during their stay in town .


Believe me , yours truly ,


B .


P.S. -- Are there anything but books ?
If so , let those extras remain untouched for the present .
I trust you have not stumbled on any more `` Aphrodites , '' and have burnt those .
I send you both the advertisements , but do n't send me the first treatise -- as I have no occasion for Caustic in that quarter .


[ Footnote 1 : In the ` Morning Chronicle ' ( June 10 , 1813 ) appeared advertisements of the two following books : -- ` Practical Observations on the best mode of curing Strictures , etc. , with Remarks on Inefficacy , etc. , of Caustic Applications ' .
By William Wadd .
Printed for J. Callow , Soho .
` Modern Poets  a Dialogue in Verse , containing some Strictures on the Poetry of Lord Byron , Mr. Southey , and Others ' .
Printed for White , Cochrane , and Co. , Fleet Street .


In a note on ` Modern Poets ' ( p. 7 ) occurs the following passage :


`` In ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ' the same respectable corps of critics is successively exhibited , in the course of only ten lines , under the following significant but somewhat incongruous forms , viz .
( 1 ) Northern Wolves , ( 2 ) Harpies , ( 3 ) Bloodhounds . ''


In proof the writer quotes lines 426-437 of the Satire .
Then follows a long review of ` Childe Harold ' , in which the critic condemns Harold , the hero , as `` an uncouth incumbrance of this flighty Lord  '' the want of `` plot ... action and fable , interest , order , end  '' and asks :


`` Shall he immortal bays aspire to wear Who immortality from man would tear , Repress the sigh which hopes a happier home , And chase the visions of a life to come ? '' ]

[ Maidenhead ] , June 13 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- Amongst the books from Bennet St. is a small vol .
of abominable poems by the Earl of Haddington which must not be in ye Catalogue on Sale -- also -- a vol .
of French Epigrams in the same predicament .


On the title page of Meletius is an inscription in writing which must be erased and made illegible .


I have read the strictures , which are just enough , and not grossly abusive , in very fair couplets .
There is a note against Massinger near the end , but one can not quarrel with one 's company , at any rate .
The author detects some incongruous figures in a passage of ` E. Bds ' .
, page 23. , but which edition I do not know .
In the sole copy in your possession -- I mean the fifth edition -- you may make these alterations , that I may profit ( though a little too late ) by his remarks : -- For `` hellish instinct , '' substitute `` brutal instinct  '' `` harpies '' alter to `` felons  '' and for `` blood-hounds '' write `` hell-hounds . ''
These be `` very bitter words , by my troth , '' and the alterations not much sweeter  but as I shall not publish the thing , they can do no harm , but are a satisfaction to me in the way of amendment .
The passage is only 12 lines .


You do not answer me about H. 's book  I want to write to him , and not to say anything unpleasing .
If you direct to Post Office , Portsmouth , till called for , I will send and receive your letter .
You never told me of the forthcoming critique on ` Columbus ' [ 1 ] which is not too fair  and I do not think justice quite done to the ` Pleasures ' , which surely entitles the author to a higher rank than that assigned to him in the ` Quarterly ' .
But I must not cavil at the decisions of the invisible infallibles  and the article is very well written .
The general horror of `` fragments '' [ 2 ] makes me tremulous for `` The Giaour  '' but you would publish it -- I presume , by this time , to your repentance .
But as I consented , whatever be its fate , I wo n't now quarrel with you , even though I detect it in my pastry  but I shall not open a pye without apprehension for some weeks .


The Books which may be marked G.O. I will carry out .
Do you know Clarke 's ` Naufragia ' [ 3 ] ?
I am told that he asserts the first volume of ` Robinson Crusoe ' was written by the first Lord Oxford , when in the Tower , and given by him to Defoe  if true , it is a curious anecdote .
Have you got back Lord Brooke 's MS. ?
and what does Heber say of it ?
Write to me at Portsmouth .


Ever yours , etc. ,

[ Footnote 1 : Rogers 's Columbus was reviewed by Ward in the Quarterly for March , 1813 .
The reviewer detects `` evident marks of haste '' in the poem . ]


[ Footnote 2 : The Giaour , like Columbus , was written in fragments . ]


[ Footnote 3 : James Stanier Clarke , a Navy Chaplain ( 1765-1834 ) , published , in 1805 , ` Naufragia , or Historical Memoirs of Shipwrecks ' .
In that work he does not himself attribute the first volume of ` Robinson Crusoe ' to Lord Oxford .
The following is the passage to which Byron refers ( ` Naufragia ' , vol .
i. pp. 12 , 13 ) : `` But before I conclude this Section , I wish to make the admirers of this Nautical Romance mindful of a Report , which prevailed many years ago  that Defoe , after all , was not the real author of Robinson Crusoe .
This assertion is noticed in an article in the seventh volume of the ` Edinburgh Magazine ' [ vol .
vii .
p. 269 ] .
Dr. Towers , in his ` Life ' of Defoe in the ` Biographia ' , is inclined to pay no attention to it  but was that writer aware of the following letter , which also appeared in the ` Gentleman 's Magazine ' for 1788 ?
( vol .
lviii .
part i. p. 208 ) .
At least no notice is taken of it in his ` Life ' of Defoe :


'' ` Dublin , February 25 .


`` Mr. Urban , -- In the course of a late conversation with a nobleman of the first consequence and information in this kingdom , he assured me , that Mr. Benjamin Holloway , of Middleton Stony , assured him , some time ago : that he knew for fact , that the celebrated Romance of ` Robinson Crusoe ' was really written by the Earl of Oxford , when confined in the Tower of London : that his Lordship gave the manuscript to Daniel Defoe , who frequently visited him during his confinement : and that Defoe , having afterwards added the second volume , published the whole as his own production .
This anecdote I would not venture to send to your valuable magazine , if I did not think my information good , and imagine it might be acceptable to your numerous readers , not-withstanding the work has heretofore been generally attributed to the latter .
W. W. '


`` It is impossible for me to enter on a discussion of this literary subject  though I thought the circumstance ought to be more generally known .
And yet I must observe , that I always discerned a very striking falling off between the composition of the first and second volumes of this Romance -- they seem to bear evident marks of having been the work of different writers . ''


A volume of memoranda in the handwriting of Warton , the Laureate , preserved in the British Museum , contains the following :


`` Mem .
Jul. 10 , 1774 .
In the year 1759 , I was told by the Rev. Mr. Benjamin Holloway , rector of Middleton Stony , in Oxfordshire , then about 70 years old , and in the early part of his life domestic Chaplain to Lord Sunderland , that he had often heard Lord Sunderland say that Lord Oxford , while a prisoner in the Tower of London , wrote the first volume of the History of Robinson Crusoe , merely as an amusement under confinement  and gave it to Daniel De Foe , who frequently visited Lord Oxford in the Tower , and was one of his Pamphlet writers .
That De Foe , by Lord Oxford 's permission , printed it as his own , and , encouraged by its extraordinary success , added himself the second volume , the inferiority of which is generally acknowledged .
Mr. Holloway also told me , from Lord Sunderland , that Lord Oxford dictated some parts of the manuscript to De Foe .
Mr. Holloway was a grave conscientious clergyman , not vain of telling anecdotes , very learned , particularly a good orientalist , author of some theological tracts , bred at Eton School , and a Master of Arts at St. John 's College , Cambridge .
He lived many years with great respect in Lord Sunderland 's family , and was like to the late Duke of Marlborough .
He died , as I remember , about the year 1761 . '' ]

June 18 , 1813 .


My Dear Sir , -- I feel greatly at a loss how to write to you at all -- still more to thank you as I ought .
If you knew the veneration with which I have ever regarded you , long before I had the most distant prospect of becoming your acquaintance , literary or personal , my embarrassment would not surprise you .


Any suggestion of yours , even were it conveyed in the less tender shape of the text of the ` Baviad ' , or a Monk Mason note in Massinger , [ 1 ] would have been obeyed  I should have endeavoured to improve myself by your censure : judge then if I shall be less willing to profit by your kindness .
It is not for me to bandy compliments with my elders and my betters : I receive your approbation with gratitude , and will not return my brass for your Gold by expressing more fully those sentiments of admiration , which , however sincere , would , I know , be unwelcome .


To your advice on Religious topics , I shall equally attend .
Perhaps the best way will be by avoiding them altogether .
The already published objectionable passages have been much commented upon , but certainly have been rather strongly interpreted .
I am no Bigot to Infidelity , and did not expect that , because I doubted the immortality of Man , I should be charged with denying the existence of a God .
It was the comparative insignificance of ourselves and our world , when placed in competition with the mighty whole , of which it is an atom , that first led me to imagine that our pretensions to eternity might be over-rated .


This , and being early disgusted with a Calvinistic Scotch school , where I was cudgelled to Church for the first ten years of my life , afflicted me with this malady  for , after all , it is , I believe , a disease of the mind as much as other kinds of hypochondria .


I regret to hear you talk of ill-health .
May you long exist !
not only to enjoy your own fame , but outlive that of fifty such ephemeral adventurers as myself .


As I do not sail quite so soon as Murray may have led you to expect ( not till July ) I trust I have some chance of taking you by the hand before my departure , and repeating in person how sincerely and affectionately I am


Your obliged servant ,

-- To Thomas Moore .


June 22 , 1813 .


Yesterday I dined in company with Stael , the `` Epicene , '' [ 1 ] whose politics are sadly changed .
She is for the Lord of Israel and the Lord of Liverpool -- a vile antithesis of a Methodist and a Tory -- talks of nothing but devotion and the ministry , and , I presume , expects that God and the government will help her to a pension .


Murray , the [ Greek : anax ] of publishers , the Anak of stationers , has a design upon you in the paper line .
He wants you to become the staple and stipendiary editor of a periodical work .
What say you ?
Will you be bound , like `` Kit Smart , to write for ninety-nine years in the Universal Visitor ? ''
[ 2 ]


Seriously , he talks of hundreds a year , and -- though I hate prating of the beggarly elements -- his proposal may be to your honour and profit , and , I am very sure , will be to our pleasure .


I do n't know what to say about `` friendship . ''
I never was in friendship but once , in my nineteenth year , and then it gave me as much trouble as love .
I am afraid , as Whitbread 's sire said to the king , when he wanted to knight him , that I am `` too old  '' [ 3 ] but nevertheless , no one wishes you more friends , fame , and felicity , than


Yours , etc. .


[ Footnote 1 :


'' ` And ah !
what verse can grace thy stately mien , Guide of the world , preferment 's golden queen , Neckar 's fair daughter , Stael the ` Epicene ' !
Bright o'er whose flaming cheek and pumple nose The bloom of young desire unceasing glows !
Fain would the Muse -- but ah !
she dares no more , A mournful voice from lone ` Guyana 's ' shore , Sad Quatremer , the bold presumption checks , Forbid to question thy ambiguous sex . '


`` These lines contain the Secret History of Quatremer 's deportation .
He presumed , in the Council of Five Hundred , to arraign Madame de Stael 's conduct , and even to hint a doubt of her sex .
He was sent to ` Guyana ' .
The transaction naturally brings to one 's mind the dialogue between Falstaff and Hostess Quickly in Shakespeare 's ` Henry IV ' . ''


` Canning 's New Morality ' , lines 293-301 ( Edmonds ' edition of the ` Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin ' , pp. 282 , 283 ) .


Anne Louise Germaine Necker ( 1766-1817 ) , only child of the Minister Necker and his wife Suzanne Curchod , Gibbon 's early love , married , in 1786 , the Swedish Ambassador Baron de Stael Holstein , who died in 1802 .
She married , as her second husband , in 1811 , M. de Rocca , a young French officer , who had been severely wounded in Spain , but survived her by a year ( Madame de Recamier , ` Souvenirs ' , vol .
i. p. 272 ) .
Her book , ` De l'Allemagne ' , seized and destroyed by Napoleon , was brought out in June , 1813 , by John Murray .
Byron thought her


`` certainly the cleverest , though not the most agreeable woman he had ever known .
` She declaimed to you instead of conversing with you , ' said he , ` never pausing except to take breath  and if during that interval a rejoinder was put in , it was evident that she did not attend to it , as she resumed the thread of her discourse as though it had not been interrupted ' ''


( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations ' , p. 26 ) .
Croker ( ` Croker Papers ' , vol .
i. p. 327 ) describes her as


`` ugly , and not of an intellectual ugliness .
Her features were coarse , and the ordinary expression rather vulgar , she had an ugly mouth , and one or two irregularly prominent teeth , which perhaps gave her countenance an habitual gaiety .
Her eye was full , dark , and expressive  and when she declaimed , which was almost whenever she spoke , she looked eloquent , and one forgot that she was plain . ''


Madame de Stael


`` did not affect to conceal her preference for the society of men to that of her own sex , ''


and was entirely above , or below , studying the feminine arts of pleasing .
In 1802 Miss Berry called on her in Paris .


`` Found her in an excessively dirty ` cabinet ' -- sofa singularly so  her own dress , a loose spencer with a bare neck ''


( ` Journal ' , vol .
ii .
p. 145 ) .
A similar experience is mentioned by Crabb Robinson ( ` Diary ' , 1804 ) .


`` On the 28th of January , '' he writes , `` I first waited on Madame de Stael .
I was shown into her bedroom , for which , not knowing Parisian customs , I was unprepared .
She was sitting , most decorously , ` in ' her bed , and writing .
She had her night-cap on , and her face was not made up for the day .
It was by no means a captivating spectacle  but I had a very cordial reception , and two bright black eyes smiled benignantly on me . ''


Of her political opinions Sir John Bowring ( ` Autobiographical Recollections ' , pp. 375 , 376 ) has left a sketch .


`` Madame de Stael was a perfect aristocrat , and her sympathies were wholly with the great and prosperous .
She saw nothing in England but the luxury , stupidity , and pride of the Tory aristocracy , and the intelligence and magnificence of the Whig aristocracy .
These latter talked about truth , and liberty and herself , and she supposed it was all as it should be .
As to the millions , the people , she never inquired into their situation .
She had a horror of the ` canaille ' , but anything of ` sangre asul ' had a charm for her .
When she was dying she said , ` Let me die in peace  let my last moments be undisturbed . '
Yet she ordered the cards of every visitor to be brought to her .
Among them was one from the Duc de Richelieu .
` What ! '
exclaimed she indignantly , ` What !
have you sent away the ` Duke ' ?
Hurry !
Fly after him .
Bring him back .
Tell him that , though I die for all the world , I live for ` him ' . ' ''


Napoleon 's hatred of her was intense .
`` Do not allow that jade , Madame de Stael , '' he writes to Fouche , December 31 , 1806 ( ` New Letters of Napoleon I. ' , p. 35 ) , `` to come near Paris . ''
Again , March 15 , 1807 ( ` ibid . '
, p. 39 ) , `` You are not to allow Madame de Stael to come within forty leagues of Paris .
That wicked schemer ought to make up her mind to behave herself at last . ''
In a third letter , April 19 , 1807 ( ` ibid . '
, p. 40 ) , he speaks of her as `` paying court , one day to the great -- a patriot , a democrat , the next !
... a fright , ... a worthless woman '' ( Leon Lecestre 's ` Lettres inedites de Napoleon I ` er ' , 2nd ed .
vol .
i. pp. 84 , 88 , 93 ) . ]


[ Footnote 2 :


`` Old Gardner the bookseller employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miscellany called the ` Universal Visitor ' .
There was a formal written contract , which Allen the printer saw ... They were bound to write nothing else  they were to have , I think , a third of the profits of his sixpenny pamphlet  and the contract was for ninety-nine years ''

`` But first the Monarch , so polite , Ask'd Mister Whitbread if he 'd be a ` Knight ' .
Unwilling in the list to be enroll'd , Whitbread contemplated the Knights of ` Peg ' , Then to his generous Sov ` reign made a leg , And said , ` He was afraid he was ` too old ' , ' '' etc. .

[ Footnote 1 : Sir Humphry Davy ( 1778-1829 ) , the son of a wood-carver of Penzance , was apprenticed to John Borlase , a surgeon at Penzance , in whose dispensary he became a chemist .
He wrote poetry as a young man , but soon abandoned the pursuit for science .
Two poems on Byron by Davy , one written in 1823 , the other in 1824 , will be found in Dr. Davy 's ` Memoirs of the Life of Sir H. Davy ' , vol .
ii .
pp. 168 , 169 .
In October , 1798 , he joined Dr. Beddoes at Bristol , where he superintended the laboratory at his Pneumatic Institution .
His ` Researches , Chemical and Philosophical ' ( 1799 ) , made him famous .
At the Royal Institution in London , founded in 1799 , Davy became assistant-lecturer in chemistry , and director of the chemical laboratory .
There his lecture-room was crowded by some of the most distinguished men and women of the day .
Within the next few years his discoveries in electricity and galvanism , ( 1806-7 ) brought him European celebrity  his lectures on agricultural chemistry ( 1810 ) marked a fresh era in farming , and inaugurated the new movement of `` science with practice . ''
His famous discovery of the Safety Lamp was made in 1816 .
He was created a baronet in 1818 .
A skilful fisherman , he wrote , when in declining health , ` Salmonia , or Days of Fly-fishing ' , published in 1827 .
Ticknor ( ` Life ' , vol .
i. p. 57 ) , speaking of Davy in 1815 , says ,


`` He is now about thirty-three , but with all the freshness and bloom of five-and-twenty , and one of the handsomest men I have seen in England .
He has a great deal of vivacity , talks rapidly , though with great precision , and is so much interested in conversation , that his excitement amounts to nervous impatience , and keeps him in constant motion . ''


Davy married , in 1812 , a rich widow , Jane Aprecce , ` nee ' Kerr ( 1780-1855 ) .
The marriage brought him wealth  but it also , it is said , impaired the simplicity of his character , and made him ambitious of social distinction .
Miss Berry ( ` Journal ' , vol .
ii .
p. 535 ) supped with Lady Davy in May , 1813 , to meet the Princess of Wales , and notes that among the other guests was Byron .
Lady Davy , who was so dark a brunette that Sydney Smith said she was as brown as a dry toast , was for many years a prominent figure in the society of London and Rome .
It was of her that Madame de Stael said that she had `` all Corinne 's talents without her faults or extravagances . ''
Ticknor , who called on her in June , 1815 ,


`` found her in her parlour , working on a dress , the contents of her basket strewed about the table , and looking more like home than anything since I left it .
She is small , with black eyes and hair , a very pleasant face , an uncommonly sweet smile , and , when she speaks , has much spirit and expression in her countenance .
Her conversation is agreeable , particularly in the choice and variety of her phraseology , and has more the air of eloquence than I have ever heard before from a lady . ''

[ Footnote 2 : ` The Satirist ' for July 1 , 1813 ( pp. 70-88 ) , reviews the ` Giaour ' at length .
It condemns it for its fragmentary character and consequent obscurity , its carelessness and defects of style  but it also admits that the poem `` abounds with proofs of genius : ''


`` A word in conclusion .
The noble lord appears to have an aristocratical solicitude to be read only by the opulent .
Four shillings and sixpence for forty-one octavo pages of poetry !
and those pages verily happily answering to Mr. Sheridan 's image of a rivulet of text flowing through a meadow of margin .
My good Lord Byron , while you are revelling in all the sensual and intellectual luxury which the successful sale of Newstead Abbey has procured for you , you little think of the privations to which you have subjected us unfortunate Reviewers , ... in order to enable us to purchase your lordship 's expensive publication .

-- To Thomas Moore .


4 , Benedictine Street , St. James 's , July 8 , 1813 .


I presume by your silence that I have blundered into something noxious in my reply to your letter , for the which I beg leave to send beforehand a sweeping apology , which you may apply to any , or all , parts of that unfortunate epistle .
If I err in my conjecture , I expect the like from you in putting our correspondence so long in quarantine .
God he knows what I have said  but he also knows ( if he is not as indifferent to mortals as the nonchalant deities of Lucretius ) , that you are the last person I want to offend .
So , if I have , -- why the devil do n't you say it at once , and expectorate your spleen ?


Rogers is out of town with Madame de Stael , who hath published an Essay against Suicide , [ 1 ] which , I presume , will make somebody shoot himself  -- as a sermon by Blenkinsop , in proof of Christianity , sent a hitherto most orthodox acquaintance of mine out of a chapel of ease a perfect atheist .
Have you found or founded a residence yet ?
and have you begun or finished a poem ?
If you wo n't tell me what I have done , pray say what you have done , or left undone , yourself .
I am still in equipment for voyaging , and anxious to hear from , or of , you before I go , which anxiety you should remove more readily , as you think I sha 'n' t cogitate about you afterwards .
I shall give the lie to that calumny by fifty foreign letters , particularly from any place where the plague is rife , -- without a drop of vinegar or a whiff of sulphur to save you from infection .


The Oxfords have sailed almost a fortnight , and my sister is in town , which is a great comfort , -- for , never having been much together , we are naturally more attached to each other .
I presume the illuminations have conflagrated to Derby ( or wherever you are ) by this time .
[ 2 ] We are just recovering from tumult and train oil , and transparent fripperies , and all the noise and nonsense of victory .
Drury Lane had a large M.W. , which some thought was Marshal Wellington  others , that it might be translated into Manager Whitbread  while the ladies of the vicinity of the saloon conceived the last letter to be complimentary to themselves .
I leave this to the commentators to illustrate .
If you do n't answer this , I sha 'n' t say what you deserve , but I think I deserve a reply .
Do you conceive there is no Post-Bag but the Twopenny ?
[ 3 ] Sunburn me , if you are not too bad .


[ Footnote 1 :


`` Madame de Stael treats me as the person whom she most delights to honour  I am generally ordered with her to dinner , as one orders beans and bacon : she is one of the few persons who surpass expectation  she has every sort of talent , and would be universally popular , if , in society , she were to confine herself to her inferior talents -- pleasantry , anecdote , and literature .
I have reviewed her ` Essay on Suicide ' in the last ` Edinburgh Review ' : it is not one of her best , and I have accordingly said more of the author and the subject than of the work . ''

-- To Thomas Moore .


July 13 , 1813 .


Your letter set me at ease  for I really thought ( as I hear of your susceptibility ) that I had said -- I know not what -- but something I should have been very sorry for , had it , or I , offended you  -- though I do n't see how a man with a beautiful wife -- his own children , -- quiet -- fame -- competency and friends , ( I will vouch for a thousand , which is more than I will for a unit in my own behalf , ) can be offended with any thing .


Do you know , Moore , I am amazingly inclined -- remember I say but inclined -- to be seriously enamoured with Lady A [ delaide ] F [ orbes ] [ 1 ] -- but this -- has ruined all my prospects .
However , you know her  is she clever , or sensible , or good-tempered ?
either would do -- I scratch out the will .
I do n't ask as to her beauty -- that I see  but my circumstances are mending , and were not my other prospects blackening , I would take a wife , and that should be the woman , had I a chance .
I do not yet know her much , but better than I did .


I want to get away , but find difficulty in compassing a passage in a ship of war .
They had better let me go  if I can not , patriotism is the word -- `` nay , an they 'll mouth , I 'll rant as well as they . ''
[ 2 ]


Now , what are you doing ?
-- writing , we all hope , for our own sakes .
Remember you must edit my posthumous works , with a Life of the Author , for which I will send you Confessions , dated `` Lazaretto , '' Smyrna , Malta , or Palermo -- one can die any where .


There is to be a thing on Tuesday ycleped a national fete [ 3 ] .
The Regent and -- are to be there , and every body else , who has shillings enough for what was once a guinea .
Vauxhall is the scene -- there are six tickets issued for the modest women , and it is supposed there will be three to spare .
The passports for the lax are beyond my arithmetic .


P. S. -- The Stael last night attacked me most furiously -- said that I had `` no right to make love -- that I had used -- barbarously -- that I had no feeling , and was totally insensible to la belle passion , and had been all my life . ''
I am very glad to hear it , but did not know it before .
Let me hear from you anon .


[ Footnote 1 :


`` Lady A. F -- ` was ' also very handsome .
It is melancholy to talk of women in the past tense .
What a pity , that of all flowers , none fade so soon as beauty !
Poor Lady A. F -- has not got married .
Do you know , I once had some thoughts of her as a wife  not that I was in love , as people call it , but I had argued myself into a belief that I ought to marry , and , meeting her very often in society , the notion came into my head , not heart , that she would suit me .
Moore , too , told me so much of her good qualities -- all which was , I believe , quite true -- that I felt tempted to propose to her , but did not , whether ` tant mieux ' or ` tant pis ' , God knows , supposing my proposal accepted . ''


( Lady Blessington 's ` Conversations ' , pp. 108 , 109 ) .


Lady Adelaide Forbes , whom Byron in Rome compared to the `` Belvedere Apollo , '' was the daughter of George , sixth Earl of Granard , and his wife , Lady Selina Rawdon , daughter of the first Earl of Moira .
Born in 1789 , she died at Dresden , in 1858 , unmarried .
Lord Moira was Moore 's patron , and , through this connection and political sympathies , Moore was acquainted with Lord Granard and his family . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Byron possibly quoted the actual words from ` Hamlet ' ( act v. sc .
1 ) , referring to Moore 's attack on the Regent in ` The Two-penny Post-bag ' :


`` Nay , an thou ` lt mouth , I 'll rant as well as thou . ''


But the letter is destroyed . ]


[ Footnote 3 : The ` Morning Chronicle ' for July 12 contains the announcement that `` the Prince Regent has projected a ` Grand National Fete ' in honour of the battle of Vittoria .
It is to be held at Vauxhall Gardens . ''
The ` fete ' was held on Tuesday , July 20 , beginning with a banquet , at which such toasts were drunk as `` The Marquis of Wellington , '' `` Sir Thomas Graham and the other officers engaged , '' `` The Spanish Armies and the brave Guerillas . ''
The ` baton ' of Marshal Jourdan was `` disposed among the plate , so as to be obvious to all . ''
The proceedings ended with illuminations and dancing . ]

-- To John Hanson .


Sunday , July 18th , 1813 .


DEAR SIR , -- A Report is in general circulation ( which has distressed my friends , and is not very pleasing to me ) , that the Purchaser of Newstead is a young man , who has been over-reached , ill-treated , and ruined , by me in this transaction of the sale , and that I take an unfair advantage of the law to enforce the contract .
This must be contradicted by a true and open statement of the circumstances attending , and subsequent to , the sale , and that immediately and publicly .
Surely , if anyone is ill treated it is myself .
He bid his own price  he took time before he bid at all , and now , when I am actually granting him further time as a favour , I hear from all quarters that I have acted unfairly .
Pray do not delay on this point  see him , and let a proper and true statement be drawn up of the sale , etc. , and inserted in the papers .


Ever yours ,


B .


P.S. -- Mr. C. himself , if he has either honour or feeling , will be the first to vindicate me from so unfounded an implication .
It is surely not for his credit to be supposed ruined or over-reached .

July 22nd , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- I have great pleasure in accepting your invitation to meet anybody or nobody as you like best .


Pray what should you suppose the book in the inclosed advertisement to be ?
is it anything relating to Buonaparte or Continental Concerns ?
If so , it may be worth looking after , particularly if it should turn out to be your purchase -- Lucien 's Epic .


Believe me , very truly yours ,


BYRON .

-- To Thomas Moore .


July 25 , 1813 .


I am not well versed enough in the ways of single woman to make much matrimonial progress .


I have been dining like the dragon of Wantley [ 1 ] for this last week .
My head aches with the vintage of various cellars , and my brains are muddled as their dregs .
I met your friends the Daltons : -- she sang one of your best songs so well , that , but for the appearance of affectation , I could have cried  he reminds me of Hunt , but handsomer , and more musical in soul , perhaps .
I wish to God he may conquer his horrible anomalous complaint .
The upper part of her face is beautiful , and she seems much attached to her husband .
He is right , nevertheless , in leaving this nauseous town .
The first winter would infallibly destroy her complexion , -- and the second , very probably , every thing else .


I must tell you a story .
Morris [ 2 ] ( of indifferent memory ) was dining out the other day , and complaining of the Prince 's coldness to his old wassailers .
D'Israeli ( a learned Jew ) bored him with questions -- why this ?
and why that ?
`` Why did the Prince act thus ? ''
-- `` Why , sir , on account of Lord -- , who ought to be ashamed of himself . ''
-- `` And why ought Lord -- to be ashamed of himself ? ''
-- `` Because the Prince , sir , -------- '' -- `` And why , sir , did the Prince cut you ? ''
-- `` Because , G -- d d -- mme , sir , I stuck to my principles . ''
-- `` And why did you stick to your principles ? ''


Is not this last question the best that was ever put , when you consider to whom ?
It nearly killed Morris .
Perhaps you may think it stupid , but , as Goldsmith said about the peas , [ 3 ] it was a very good joke when I heard it -- as I did from an ear-witness -- and is only spoilt in my narration .


The season has closed with a dandy ball  [ 4 ] -- but I have dinners with the Harrowbys , Rogers , and Frere and Mackintosh [ 5 ] , where I shall drink your health in a silent bumper , and regret your absence till `` too much canaries '' wash away my memory , or render it superfluous by a vision of you at the opposite side of the table .
Canning has disbanded his party by a speech from his [ -- ] -- the true throne of a Tory [ 6 ] .


Conceive his turning them off in a formal harangue , and bidding them think for themselves .
`` I have led my ragamuffins where they are well peppered .
There are but three of the 150 left alive , '' [ 7 ] and they are for the Townsend ( query , might not Falstaff mean the Bow Street officer ?
I dare say Malone 's posthumous edition will have it so ) for life .


Since I wrote last , I have been into the country .
I journeyed by night -- no incident , or accident , but an alarm on the part of my valet on the outside , who , in crossing Epping Forest , actually , I believe , flung down his purse before a mile-stone , with a glow-worm in the second figure of number XIX -- mistaking it for a footpad and dark lantern .
I can only attribute his fears to a pair of new pistols wherewith I had armed him  and he thought it necessary to display his vigilance by calling out to me whenever we passed any thing -- no matter whether moving or stationary .
Conceive ten miles , with a tremor every furlong .
I have scribbled you a fearfully long letter .
This sheet must be blank , and is merely a wrapper , to preclude the tabellarians [ 8 ] of the post from peeping .
You once complained of my not writing  -- I will `` heap coals of fire upon your head '' by not complaining of your not reading .
Ever , my dear Moore , your'n ( is n't that the Staffordshire termination ? )
, BYRON .


[ Footnote 1 : Under the title of `` An excellent Ballad of a most dreadful combat , fought between Moore of Moore-Hall and the Dragon of Wantley , '' this ballad forms ( in the 12th edition ) the Argument of ` The Dragon of Wantley , a Burlesque Opera ' , performed at Covent Garden , the libretto of which is by Sig .
Carini , ` i.e. ' Henry Carey :


`` Have you not heard of the ` Trojan ' Horse  With Seventy Men in his Belly ?
This Dragon was not quite so big , But very near , I 'll tell you  Devoured he poor Children three , That could not with him grapple  And at one sup he eat them up , As one would eat an Apple .


`` All sorts of Cattle this Dragon did eat , Some say he eat up Trees , And that the Forest sure he would Devour by degrees .
For Houses and Churches were to him Geese and Turkies  He eat all , and left none behind , But some Stones , dear Jack , which he could not crack , Which on the Hills you 'll find . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : Charles Morris ( 1745-1838 ) served in the 17th Foot , the Royal Irish Dragoons , and finally in the Second Life Guards .
He was laureate and punch-maker to the Beef-steak Club , founded in 1735 by John Rich , patentee of Covent Garden Theatre .
The Prince of Wales became a member of the Club in 1785 , and Morris was a frequent guest at Carlton House .
Another member of the Club was the Duke of Norfolk , who gave Morris the villa at Brockham , near Betchworth , where he lived and died .


Morris , who was an admirable song-writer and singer , attached himself politically to the Prince 's party , and attacked Pitt in such popular ballads as `` Billy 's too young to drive us , '' and `` Billy Pitt and the Farmer . ''
He was , however , disappointed in his hope of reward from his political patrons , and vented his spleen in his ode , `` The Old Whig Poet to his Old Buff Waistcoat ''


`` Farewell , thou poor rag of the Muse !
In the bag of the clothesman go lie  A farthing thou ` lt fetch from the Jews , Which the hard-hearted Christians deny , '' etc. .


Some of his poems deserve the censure of ` The Shade of Pope ' ( line 225 ) :


`` There reeling Morris and his bestial songs . ''


But others , in their ease and vivacity , hold their own with all but the best of Moore 's songs .
A collection of them was printed in two volumes by Bentley , in 1840 , under the title of ` Lyra Urbanica ' . ]


[ Footnote 3 : In Forster 's ` Life of Goldsmith ' ( vol .
i. p. 34 ) it is related that Goldsmith ran away from Trinity College , Dublin , because he had been beaten by one of the Fellows .
He started for Cork with a shilling in his pocket , on which he lived for three days .
He told Reynolds that he thought


`` a handful of grey pease , given him by a girl at a wake ( after fasting for twenty-four hours ) the most comfortable repast he had ever made . ''


Byron may mean that any joke seems good to a man who had not heard one for a day . ]


[ Footnote 4 :


`` I liked the Dandies , '' says Byron , in his ` Detached Thoughts '  `` they were always very civil to me , though in general they disliked literary people , and persecuted and mystified Madme .
de Stael , Lewis , Horace Twiss , and the like , damnably .
They persuaded Madme .
de Stael that Alvanley had a hundred thousand a year , etc. , etc. , till she praised him to his face for his beauty !
and made a set at him for Albertine ( ` Libertine ' , as Brummell baptized her , though the poor girl was , and is , as correct as maid or wife can be , and very amiable withal ) , and a hundred other fooleries besides .
The truth is , that , though I gave up the business early , I had a tinge of Dandyism in my minority , and probably retained enough of it to conciliate the great ones at four and twenty .
I had gamed and drunk and taken my degrees in most dissipations , and , having no pedantry , and not being overbearing , we ran quietly together .
I knew them all more or less , and they made me a member of Watier 's ( a superb club at that time ) , being , I take it , the only literary man ( except ` two ' others , both men of the world , M [ oore ] and S [ pencer ] ) in it .
Our Masquerade was a grand one  so was the Dandy Ball too -- at the Argyle , -- but ` that ' ( the latter ) was given by the four chiefs -- B [ rummel ? ]
, M [ idmay ? ]
, A [ lvanley ? ]
, and P [ ierreoint ? ]
, if I err not . '' ]


[ Footnote 5 : Sir James Mackintosh ( 1765-1832 ) , after studying medicine , was called to the English Bar in 1795 .
Originally a supporter of the French Revolution , he answered Burke 's ` Reflections ' with his ` Vindiciae Gallicae ' ( 1791 ) .
He is `` Mr. Macfungus '' in the ` Anti-Jacobin 's ' account of the `` Meeting of the Friends of Freedom . ''
But his revolutionary sympathies rapidly cooled , and he publicly disavowed them in his ` Introductory Discourse on the Study of the Law of Nature and Nations ' ( 1799 ) .
He remained , however , throughout his life , a Whig .
His lectures on '' ` The Law of Nature and Nations ' , '' delivered at Lincoln 's Inn , in 1799 , brought him into prominence , both at the Bar and in society .
In 1803 he was knighted on accepting the Recordership of Bombay .
He returned to England in 1812 , entered Parliament as member for Nairn , advocated some useful measures , became a Privy Councillor in 1828 , and held office in the Whig Ministry of 1830 as Commissioner of the Board of Control .
In politics , as well as in literature , he disappointed expectation .
His principal works , besides those mentioned above , were his ` Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy ' ( 1830 ) , and his ` History of the Revolution in England in 1688 ' ( 1834 ) .


His great intellectual powers were shown to most advantage in society .
Rogers ( ` Table-Talk ' , pp. 197 , 198 ) thought him one of the three acutest men he had ever known .


`` He had a prodigious memory , and could repeat by heart more of Cicero than you could easily believe ... I never met a man with a fuller mind than Mackintosh , -- such readiness on all subjects , such a talker . ''


`` Till subdued by age and illness , '' wrote Sydney Smith ( ` Life of Mackintosh ' , vol .
ii .
p. 500 ) , `` his conversation was more brilliant and instructive than that of any human being I ever had the good fortune to be acquainted with . ''


As in political life , so in society , he was too much of the lecturer .
Ticknor ( ` Life ' , vol .
i. p. 265 ) thought him `` a little too precise , a little too much made up in his manners and conversation . ''
But on all sides there is evidence to confirm the testimony of Rogers ( ` Table-Talk ' , p. 207 ) that he was a man `` who had not a particle of envy or jealousy in his nature . '' ]


[ Footnote 6 : George Canning ( 1770-1827 ) had been offered the Foreign Office in 1812 after the assassination of Perceval , on condition that Castlereagh should lead the House of Commons .
He refused the offer .
Elected M.P. for Liverpool in 1812 , he had , in July , 1813 , disbanded his followers , and in 1814 left England .
He supported Lord Liverpool in carrying the repressive measures known as the Six Acts ( 1817-20 ) , and , on the death of Lord Londonderry , in 1822 , entered the Government as Secretary for Foreign Affairs .
It is to the private speech to his followers , in July , 1813 , that Byron refers .


The ` Morning Chronicle ' for July 29 , 1813 , has the following paragraph :


`` Mr. Canning it seems has ( to use a French phrase ) ` reformed ' his political corps .
He assembled them at the close of the Session , and with many expressions of regret for the failure of certain negociations , which might have been favourable to them as a body , relieved them from their oaths of allegiance , and recommended them to pursue in future their objects separately .
The Right Honourable gentleman , perhaps , finds it more convenient for himself to act unencumbered  and both he and one or two others may find their interest in disbanding the squad  but some of them are turned off ` without a character ' . ''


The ` Courier ' for July 29 , quoting the first part of the statement , adds ,


`` We believe ... that Mr. Canning is not indisposed to join the present Cabinet , and may wish one or two of his particular friends to come in with him . '' ]


[ Footnote 7 :


`` I have led my ragamuffins where they are pepper'd : there 's but three of my hundred and fifty left alive  and they are for the town 's end , to beg during life . ''


( ` Henry IV ' .
, Part I. act v. sc .
3 ) .
Townshend , the Bow Street officer , is described by Cronow ( ` Reminiscences ' , vol .
i. p. 286 ) as


`` a little fat man with a flaxen wig , Kersey-mere breeches , a blue straight-cut coat , and a broad-brimmed white hat .
To the most daring courage he added great dexterity and cunning  and was said , ` in propria persona ' , to have taken more thieves than all the other Bow Street officers put together . '' ]

When you next imitate the style of `` Tacitus , '' pray add , de moribus Germannorum  -- this last was a piece of barbarous silence , and could only be taken from the Woods , and , as such , I attribute it entirely to your sylvan sequestration at Mayfield Cottage .
You will find , on casting up accounts , that you are my debtor by several sheets and one epistle .
I shall bring my action  -- if you do n't discharge , expect to hear from my attorney .
I have forwarded your letter to Ruggiero [ 1 ]  but do n't make a postman of me again , for fear I should be tempted to violate your sanctity of wax or wafer .

July 28 , 1813 .


Ca n't you be satisfied with the pangs of my jealousy of Rogers , without actually making me the pander of your epistolary intrigue ?
This is the second letter you have enclosed to my address , notwithstanding a miraculous long answer , and a subsequent short one or two of your own .
If you do so again , I ca n't tell to what pitch my fury may soar .
I shall send you verse or arsenic , as likely as any thing , -- four thousand couplets on sheets beyond the privilege of franking  that privilege , sir , of which you take an undue advantage over a too susceptible senator , by forwarding your lucubrations to every one but himself .
I wo n't frank from you , or for you , or to you -- may I be curst if I do , unless you mend your manners .
I disown you -- I disclaim you -- and by all the powers of Eulogy , I will write a panegyric upon you -- or dedicate a quarto -- if you do n't make me ample amends .


P.S. -- I am in training to dine with Sheridan [ 1 ] and Rogers this evening .
I have a little spite against R. , and will shed his `` Clary wines pottle-deep . ''
[ 2 ] This is nearly my ultimate or penultimate letter  for I am quite equipped , and only wait a passage .
Perhaps I may wait a few weeks for Sligo , but not if I can help it .


[ Footnote 1 : In his ` Detached Thoughts ' Byron has noted the following impressions of Sheridan :


`` In society I have met Sheridan frequently : he was superb !
He had a sort of liking for me , and never attacked me , at least to my face , as he did every body else -- high names , and wits , and orators , some of them poets also .
I have seen him cut up Whitbread , quiz Madame de Stael , annihilate Colman , and do little less by some others ( whose names , as friends , I set not down ) of good fame and ability .
Poor fellow !
he got drunk very thoroughly and very soon .
It occasionally fell to my lot to pilot him home -- no sinecure , for he was so tipsy that I was obliged to put on his cocked hat for him .
To be sure , it tumbled off again , and I was not myself so sober as to be able to pick it up again .


`` The last time I met him was , I think , at Sir Gilbert Elliot 's , where he was as quick as ever -- no , it was not the last time  the last time was at Douglas Kinnaird 's .
I have met him in all places and parties -- at Whitehall with the Melbournes , at the Marquis of Tavistock 's , at Robins 's the auctioneer 's , at Sir Humphry Davy 's , at Sam Rogers 's , -- in short , in most kinds of company , and always found him very convivial and delightful .


`` I have seen Sheridan weep two or three times .
It may be that he was maudlin  but this only renders it more impressive , for who would see


` From Marlborough 's eyes the tears of dotage flow , And Swift expire a driveller and a show ' ?


`` Once I saw him cry at Robins 's the auctioneer 's , after a splendid dinner , full of great names and high spirits .
I had the honour of sitting next to Sheridan .
The occasion of his tears was some observation or other upon the subject of the sturdiness of the Whigs in resisting office and keeping to their principles : Sheridan turned round : ` Sir , it is easy for my Lord G. or Earl G. or Marquis B. or Lord H. with thousands upon thousands a year , some of it either ` presently ' derived , or ` inherited ' in sinecure or acquisitions from the public money , to boast of their patriotism and keep aloof from temptation  but they do not know from what temptation those have kept aloof who had equal pride , at least equal talents , and not unequal passions , and nevertheless knew not in the course of their lives what it was to have a shilling of their own . '
And in saying this he wept .


`` There was something odd about Sheridan .
One day , at dinner , he was slightly praising that pert pretender and impostor , Lyttelton ( the Parliamentary puppy , still alive , I believe ) .
I took the liberty of differing from him  he turned round upon me , and said , ` Is that your real opinion ? '
I confirmed it .
Then said he , ` Fortified by this concurrence , I beg leave to say that it , in fact , is ` my ' opinion also , and that he is a person whom I do absolutely and utterly despise , abhor , and detest . '
He then launched out into a description of his despicable qualities , at some length , and with his usual wit , and evidently in earnest ( for he hated Lyttelton ) .
His former compliment had been drawn out by some preceding one , just as its reverse was by my hinting that it was unmerited .


`` I have more than once heard him say , ` that he never had a shilling of his own . '
To be sure , he contrived to extract a good many of other people 's .


`` In 1815 I had occasion to visit my lawyer in Chancery Lane  he was with Sheridan .
After mutual greetings , etc. , Sheridan retired first .
Before recurring to my own business , I could not help inquiring ` that ' of Sheridan .
` Oh , ' replied the attorney , ` the usual thing !
to stave off an action from his wine-merchant , my client . '
-- ` Well , ' said I , ` and what do you mean to do ? '
-- ` Nothing at all for the present , ' said he : ` would you have us proceed against old Sherry ?
what would be the use of it ? '
and here he began laughing , and going over Sheridan 's good gifts of conversation .


`` Now , from personal experience , I can vouch that my attorney is by no means the tenderest of men , or particularly accessible to any kind of impression out of the statute or record  and yet Sheridan , in half an hour , had found the way to soften and seduce him in such a manner , that I almost think he would have thrown his client ( an honest man , with all the laws , and some justice , on his side ) out of the window , had he come in at the moment .


`` Such was Sheridan !
he could soften an attorney !
There has been nothing like it since the days of Orpheus .


`` One day I saw him take up his own '' Monody on Garrick ' . '
He lighted upon the Dedication to the Dowager Lady Spencer .
On seeing it , he flew into a rage , and exclaimed ` that it must be a forgery , that he had never dedicated any thing of his to such a damned canting bitch , ' etc. , etc. -- and so went on for half an hour abusing his own dedication , or at least the object of it .
If all writers were equally sincere , it would be ludicrous .


`` He told me that , on the night of the grand success of his ` School for Scandal ' he was knocked down and put into the watch-house for making a row in the street , and being found intoxicated by the watchmen .
Latterly , when found drunk one night in the kennel , and asked his name by the watchmen , he answered , ` Wilberforce . '


`` When dying he was requested to undergo ` an operation . '
He replied that he had already submitted to two , which were enough for one man 's lifetime .
Being asked what they were , he answered , ` having his hair cut , and sitting for his picture . ''


`` I have met George Colman occasionally , and thought him extremely pleasant and convivial .
Sheridan 's humour , or rather wit , was always saturnine , and sometimes savage  he never laughed ( at least that ` I ' saw , and I watched him ) , but Colman did .
If I had to ` choose ' and could not have both at a time I should say , ` Let me begin the evening with Sheridan , and finish it with Colman . '
Sheridan for dinner , Colman for supper  Sheridan for claret or port but Colman for every thing , from the madeira and champagne at dinner the claret with a ` layer ' of ` port ' between the glasses up to the punch of the night , and down to the grog , or gin and water , of daybreak  -- all these I have threaded with both the same .
Sheridan was a grenadier company of life guards , but Colman a whole regiment -- of ` light infantry ' , to be sure , but still a regiment . '' ]

July 31 , 1813 .


Dear Sir -- As I leave town early tomorrow , the proof must be sent to-night , or many days will be lost .
If you have any reviews of the ` Giaour ' to send , let me have them now .
I am not very well to day .
I thank you for the ` Satirist ' , which is short but savage on this unlucky affair , and personally facetious on me which is much more to the purpose than a tirade upon other peoples ' concerns [ 1 ] .


Ever yours , B .


[ Footnote 1 : In the ` Satirist ' ( vol .
xiii .
pp. 150 , 151 ) is an article headed `` Scandalum Magnatum , '' with the motto from ` Rejected Addresses ' :


With horn-handled knife , To kill a tender lamb as dead as mutton . ''


`` A short time back ( say the newspapers , and newspapers never say ` the thing which is not ' ) Lady H. gave a ball and supper .
Among the company were Lord B -- n , Lady W -- , and Lady C. L -- b. Lord B. , it would appear , is a favourite with the latter Lady  on this occasion , however , he seemed to lavish his attention on another fair object .
This preference so enraged Lady C. L. that in a paroxysm of jealousy she took up a dessert-knife and stabbed herself .
The gay circle was , of course , immediately plunged in confusion and dismay , which however , was soon succeeded by levity and scandal .
The general cry for medical assistance was from Lady W -- d : Lady W -- d !!!
And why ?
Because it was said that , early after her marriage , Lady W -- also took a similar liberty with her person for a similar cause , and was therefore considered to have learned from experience the most efficacious remedy for the complaint .
It was also whispered that the Lady 's husband had most to grieve , that the attempt had not fully succeeded .
Lady C. L. is still living .


`` The poet has told us how ` Ladies wish to be who love their Lords  ' but this is the first public demonstration in our times to show us how Ladies wish to be who love , not their own , but others ' Lords .
` Better be with the dead than thus , ' cried the jealous fair  and , casting a languishing look at Lord B -- , who , Heaven knows , is more like Pan than Apollo , she whipt up as pretty a little dessert-knife as a Lady could desire to commit suicide with ,


` And stuck it in her wizzard . '


`` The desperate Lady was carried out of the room , and the affair endeavoured to be hushed up , etc. , etc. '' ]

Bt .
Str. , August 2 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- I was honoured with your unexpected and very obliging letter , when on the point of leaving London , which prevented me from acknowledging my obligation as quickly as I felt it sincerely .
I am endeavouring all in my power to be ready before Saturday -- and even if I should not succeed , I can only blame my own tardiness , which will not the less enhance the benefit I have lost .
I have only to add my hope of forgiveness for all my trespasses on your time and patience , and with my best wishes for your public and private welfare , I have the honour to be , most truly , Your obliged and most obedient servant , BYRON .

August 12 , 1813 .


My Dear Webster , -- I am , you know , a detestable correspondent , and write to no one person whatever  you therefore can not attribute my silence to any thing but want of good breeding or good taste , and not to any more atrocious cause  and as I confess the fault to be entirely mine -- why -- you will pardon it .


I have ordered a copy of the ` Giaour ' ( which is nearly doubled in quantity in this edition ) to be sent , and I will first scribble my name in the title page .
Many and sincere thanks for your good opinion of book , and ( I hope to add ) author .


Rushton shall attend you whenever you please , though I should like him to stay a few weeks , and help my other people in forwarding my chattels .
Your taking him is no less a favor to me than him  and I trust he will behave well .
If not , your remedy is very simple  only do n't let him be idle  honest I am sure he is , and I believe good-hearted and quiet .
No pains has been spared , and a good deal of expense incurred in his education  accounts and mensuration , etc. , he ought to know , and I believe he does .


I write this near London , but your answer will reach me better in Bennet Street , etc. ( as before ) .
I am going very soon , and if you would do the same thing -- as far as Sicily -- I am sure you would not be sorry .
My sister , Mrs. L. goes with me -- her spouse is obliged to retrench for a few years ( but he stays at home )  so that his link boy prophecy ( if ever he made it ) recoils upon himself .


I am truly glad to hear of Lady Frances 's good health .
Have you added to your family ?
Pray make my best respects acceptable to her Ladyship .


Nothing will give me more pleasure than to hear from you as soon and as fully as you please .
Ever most truly yours ,


BYRON .

-- To Thomas Moore .


Bennet Street , August 22 , 1813 .


As our late -- I might say , deceased -- correspondence had too much of the town-life leaven in it , we will now , paulo majora , prattle a little of literature in all its branches  and first of the first -- criticism .
The Prince is at Brighton , and Jackson , the boxer , gone to Margate , having , I believe , decoyed Yarmouth to see a milling in that polite neighbourhood [ 1 ] .


Mad ` e. de Stael Holstein has lost one of her young barons [ 2 ] , who has been carbonadoed by a vile Teutonic adjutant , -- kilt and killed in a coffee-house at Scrawsenhawsen .
Corinne is , of course , what all mothers must be , -- but will , I venture to prophesy , do what few mothers could -- write an Essay upon it .
She can not exist without a grievance -- and somebody to see , or read , how much grief becomes her .
I have not seen her since the event  but merely judge ( not very charitably ) from prior observation .


In a `` mail-coach copy '' of the Edinburgh [ 3 ] I perceive The Giaour is second article .
The numbers are still in the Leith smack -- pray which way is the wind ?
The said article is so very mild and sentimental , that it must be written by Jeffrey in love [ 4 ]  -- you know he is gone to America to marry some fair one , of whom he has been , for several quarters , eperdument amoureux .
Seriously -- as Winifred Jenkins [ 5 ] says of Lismahago -- Mr. Jeffrey ( or his deputy ) `` has done the handsome thing by me , '' and I say nothing .
But this I will say , if you and I had knocked one another on the head in this quarrel , how he would have laughed , and what a mighty bad figure we should have cut in our posthumous works .
By the by , I was call'd in the other day to mediate between two gentlemen bent upon carnage , and -- after a long struggle between the natural desire of destroying one 's fellow-creatures , and the dislike of seeing men play the fool for nothing , -- I got one to make an apology , and the other to take it , and left them to live happy ever after [ 6 ] .


One was a peer , the other a friend untitled , and both fond of high play  -- and one , I can swear for , though very mild , `` not fearful , '' and so dead a shot , that , though the other is the thinnest of men , he would have split him like a cane .
They both conducted themselves very well , and I put them out of pain as soon as I could .


There is an American Life of G. F. Cooke [ 7 ] , Scurra deceased , lately published .
Such a book !
-- I believe , since Drunken Barnaby 's Journal [ 8 ] nothing like it has drenched the press .
All green-room and tap-room -- drams and the drama -- brandy , whisky-punch , and , latterly , toddy , overflow every page .
Two things are rather marvellous , -- first , that a man should live so long drunk , and , next , that he should have found a sober biographer .
There are some very laughable things in it , nevertheless  -- but the pints he swallowed , and the parts he performed , are too regularly registered .


All this time you wonder I am not gone  so do I  but the accounts of the plague are very perplexing -- not so much for the thing itself as the quarantine established in all ports , and from all places , even from England .
It is true , the forty or sixty days would , in all probability , be as foolishly spent on shore as in the ship  but one likes to have one 's choice , nevertheless .
Town is awfully empty  but not the worse for that .
I am really puzzled with my perfect ignorance of what I mean to do  -- not stay , if I can help it , but where to go ?
Sligo is for the North  -- a pleasant place , Petersburgh , in September , with one 's ears and nose in a muff , or else tumbling into one 's neckcloth or pocket-handkerchief !
If the winter treated Buonaparte with so little ceremony , what would it inflict upon your solitary traveller ?
-- Give me a sun , I care not how hot , and sherbet , I care not how cool , and my Heaven is as easily made as your Persian 's [ 9 ] .


The Giaour is now a thousand and odd lines .
`` Lord Fanny spins a thousand such a day , '' [ 10 ] eh , Moore ?
-- thou wilt needs be a wag , but I forgive it .
Yours ever ,


BYRON .


P. S. -- I perceive I have written a flippant and rather cold-hearted letter !
let it go , however .
I have said nothing , either , of the brilliant sex  but the fact is , I am at this moment in a far more serious , and entirely new , scrape [ 11 ] than any of the last twelve months , -- and that is saying a good deal .
It is unlucky we can neither live with nor without these women .


I am now thinking of regretting that , just as I have left Newstead , you reside near it .
Did you ever see it ?
do -- but do n't tell me that you like it .
If I had known of such intellectual neighbourhood , I do n't think I should have quitted it .
You could have come over so often , as a bachelor , -- for it was a thorough bachelor 's mansion -- plenty of wine and such sordid sensualities -- with books enough , room enough , and an air of antiquity about all ( except the lasses ) that would have suited you , when pensive , and served you to laugh at when in glee .
I had built myself a bath and a vault -- and now I sha 'n' t even be buried in it .
It is odd that we ca n't even be certain of a grave , at least a particular one .
I remember , when about fifteen , reading your poems there , which I can repeat almost now , -- and asking all kinds of questions about the author , when I heard that he was not dead according to the preface  wondering if I should ever see him -- and though , at that time , without the smallest poetical propensity myself , very much taken , as you may imagine , with that volume .
Adieu -- I commit you to the care of the gods -- Hindoo , Scandinavian , and Hellenic !


P.S. 2d .
-- There is an excellent review of Grimm 's Correspondence and Madame de Stael in this No .
of the E [ dinburgh ] R [ eview ] [ 12 ] .
Jeffrey , himself , was my critic last year  but this is , I believe , by another hand .
I hope you are going on with your grand coup -- pray do -- or that damned Lucien Buonaparte will beat us all .
I have seen much of his poem in MS. , and he really surpasses every thing beneath Tasso .
Hodgson is translating him against another bard .
You and ( I believe Rogers , ) Scott , Gifford , and myself , are to be referred to as judges between the twain , -- that is , if you accept the office .
Conceive our different opinions !
I think we , most of us ( I am talking very impudently , you will think -- us , indeed ! )
have a way of our own , -- at least , you and Scott certainly have .


[ Footnote 1 : The fight , in which Harry Harmer , `` the Coppersmith '' ( 1784-1834 ) , beat Jack Ford , took place at St. Nicholas , near Margate , August 23 , 1813 .


Francis Charles Seymour Conway , Earl of Yarmouth ( 1777-1842 ) , succeeded his father as second Marquis of Hertford in 1822 .
The colossal libertinism and patrician splendour of his life inspired Disraeli to paint him as `` Monmouth '' in ` Coningsby ' , and Thackeray as `` Steyne '' in ` Vanity Fair ' .
He married , in 1798 , Maria Fagniani , claimed as a daughter by George Selwyn and by `` Old Q. , '' and enriched by both .
Yarmouth , as an intimate friend of the Regent , and the son of the Prince 's female favourite , was the butt of Moore and the Whig satirists .
Byron gibes at Yarmouth 's red whiskers , which helped to gain him the name of `` Red Herrings '' in the ` Waltz ' , line 142 , ` note ' 1 .
Yarmouth , like Byron , patronized the fancy , and , like him also , was a frequenter of Manton 's shooting-gallery in Davies Street  but there is no record of their being acquainted , though the house , which Byron occupied ( 13 , Piccadilly Terrace ) during his brief married life , was in the occupation of Lord Yarmouth before Byron took it from the Duchess of Devonshire . ]


[ Footnote 2 : Albert de Stael


`` led an irregular life , and met a deplorable death at Doberan , a small city of the duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin , on the coast of the Baltic Sea , a favourite resort in summer for bathing , gambling , etc. .
Some officers of the etat-major of Bernadotte had gone to try their luck in this place of play and pleasure .
They quarrelled over some louis , and a duel immediately ensued .
I well remember that the Grand-Duke Paul of Mecklenburg-Schwerin told me he was there at the time , and , while walking with his tutors in the park , suddenly heard the clinking of swords in a neighbouring thicket .
They ran to the place , and reached it just in time to see the head of Albert fall , cleft by one of those long and formidable sabres which were carried by the Prussian cavalry . ''


The above passage is quoted from the unpublished ` Souvenirs ' of M. Pictet de Sergy , given by A. Stevens in his ` Life of Madame de Stael ' , vol .
ii .
pp. 204 , 205 . ]


[ Footnote 3 : Only special copies of books published in Edinburgh came to London by coach : the bulk was forwarded in Leith smacks .


In the ` Edinburgh Review ' for July , 1813 , the ` Giaour ' was reviewed as a poem `` full of spirit , character , and originality , '' and producing an effect at once `` powerful and pathetic . ''
But the reviewer considers that `` energy of character and intensity of emotion ... presented in combination with worthlessness and guilt , '' are `` most powerful corrupters and perverters of our moral nature , '' and he deplores Byron 's exclusive devotion to gloomy and revolting subjects . ]


[ Footnote 4 : Francis Jeffrey ( 1773-1850 ) succeeded Sidney Smith as editor of the ` Edinburgh Review ' ( founded 1802 ) , and held the editorship till 1829 .
The first number of the ` Review ' , says Francis Horner , brought to light `` the genius of that little man . ''
During the first six years of its existence , he wrote upwards of seventy articles .
At the same time , he was a successful lawyer .
Called to the Scottish Bar in 1794 , he became successively Dean of the Faculty of Advocates ( 1829 ) , Lord Advocate ( 1830 ) , and a Judge of the Court of Sessions ( 1834 ) with the title of Lord Jeffrey .
He married , as his second wife , at New York , in October , 1813 , Charlotte Wilkes , a grandniece of John Wilkes .


Jeffrey is described at considerable length by Ticknor , in a letter , dated February 8 , 1814 ( ` Life of G. Ticknor ' , vol .
i. pp. 43-47 ) :


`` You are to imagine , then , before you a short , stout , little gentleman , about five and a half feet high , with a very red face , black hair , and black eyes .
You are to suppose him to possess a very gay and animated countenance , and you are to see in him all the restlessness of a will-o ' - wisp ... He enters a room with a countenance so satisfied , and a step so light and almost fantastic , that all your previous impressions of the dignity and severity of the ` Edinburgh Review ' are immediately put to flight ... It is not possible , however , to be long in his presence without understanding something of his real character , for the same promptness and assurance which mark his entrance into a room carry him at once into conversation .
The moment a topic is suggested -- no matter what or by whom -- he comes forth , and the first thing you observe is his singular fluency , '' etc. , etc. .


By the side of this description may be set that given of Jeffrey by Francis Horner ( ` Life of Jeffrey ' , 2nd edition , vol .
i. p. 212 ) :


`` His manner is not at first pleasing  what is worse , it is of that cast which almost irresistibly impresses upon strangers the idea of levity and superficial talents .
Yet there is not any man whose real character is so much the reverse . ''


The secret of his success , both as editor and critic , is that he made the ` Review ' the expression of the Whig character , both in its excellences and its limitations .
A man of clear , discriminating mind , of cool and placid judgment , he refused to accept the existing state of things , was persuaded that it might be safely improved , saw the practical steps required , and had the courage of his convictions .
He was suspicious of large principles , somewhat callous to enthusiasm or sentiment , intolerant of whatever was incapable of precise expression .
His intellectual strength lay not in the possession of one great gift , but in the simultaneous exercise of several well-adjusted talents .
His literary taste was correct  but it consisted rather in recognizing compliance with accepted rules of proved utility than in the readiness to appreciate novelties of thought and treatment .
Hence his criticism , though useful for his time , has not endured beyond his day .
It may be doubted whether more could be expected from a man who was eminently successful in addressing a jury .
`` He might not know his subject , but he knew his readers '' ( Bagehot 's ` Literary Studies ' , vol .
i. p. 30 ) .


Byron , believing him to have been the author of the famous article on ` Hours of Idleness ' , attacked him bitterly in ` English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers '  ( lines 460-528 ) .
He afterwards recognized his error .
` Don Juan ' ( Canto X. stanza xvi . )
expresses his mature opinion of a critic who , whatever may have been his faults , was as absolutely honest as political prejudice would permit :


`` And all our little feuds , at least all ` mine ' , Dear Jeffrey , once my most redoubted foe ( As far as rhyme and criticism combine To make such puppets of us things below ) , Are over  Here 's a health to ` Auld Lang Syne ! '
I do not know you , and may never know Your face -- but you have acted , on the whole , Most nobly  and I own it from my soul . ''

[ Footnote 7 : G. F. Cooke ( 1755-1812 ) , from 1794 to 1800 was the hero of the Dublin stage , with the exception of an interval , during which he served in the army .
On October 31 , 1800 , he appeared at Covent Garden as `` Richard III. , '' and afterwards played such parts in tragedy as `` Iago '' and `` Shylock '' with great success .
In comedy he was also a favourite , especially as `` Kitely '' in ` Every Man in his Humour ' , and `` Sir Pertinax MacSycophant '' in ` The Man of the World ' .
His last appearance on the London stage was as `` Falstaff , '' June 5 , 1810 .
In that year he sailed for New York , and , September 26 , 1812 , died there from his `` incorrigible habits of drinking . ''


Byron uses the word ` scurra ' , which generally means a `` parasite , '' in its other sense of a `` buffoon . ''

[ Footnote 8 : The original edition of ` Drunken Barnaby 's Journal ' , a small square volume , without date , was probably printed about 1650 .
The author was supposed to be Barnaby Harrington of Queen 's College , Oxford .
But Joseph Haslewood , whose edition ( 1818 ) is the best , attributed it to Richard Brathwait ( circ .
1588-1673 ) .
The title of the second edition ( 1716 ) runs as follows : ` Drunken Barnaby 's Four Journeys to the North of England .
In Latin and English Verse .
Wittily and merrily ( tho ' near one hundred years ago ) composed  found among some old musty books , that had a long time lain by in a corner  and now at last made publick .
To which is added , Bessy Bell ' .


`` Drunken Barnaby '' was also the burden of an old ballad quoted by Haslewood :


`` Barnaby , Barnaby , thou ` st been drinking , I can tell by thy nose , and thy eyes winking  Drunk at Richmond , drunk at Dover , Drunk at Newcastle , drunk all over .
Hey , Barnaby !
tak 't for a warning , Be no more drunk , nor dry in a morning ! '' ]

August 26 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- I have looked over and corrected one proof , but not so carefully ( God knows if you can read it through , but I ca n't ) as to preclude your eye from discovering some omission of mine or commission of y' e Printer .
If you have patience , look it over .
Do you know any body who can stop -- I mean point-commas , and so forth ?
for I am , I hear , a sad hand at your punctuation .
I have , but with some difficulty , not added any more to this snake of a poem , which has been lengthening its rattles every month .
It is now fearfully long , being more than a canto and a half of C. H. , which contains but 882 lines per book , with all late additions inclusive .


The last lines Hodgson likes -- it is not often he does -- and when he do n't , he tells me with great energy , and I fret and alter .
I have thrown them in to soften the ferocity of our Infidel , and , for a dying man , have given him a good deal to say for himself .


Do you think you shall get hold of the female MS. you spoke of to day ?
if so , you will let me have a glimpse  but do n't tell our master ( not W 's ) , or we shall be buffeted .


I was quite sorry to hear you say you stayed in town on my account , and I hope sincerely you did not mean so superfluous a piece of politeness .


Our six critiques !
-- they would have made half a Quarterly by themselves  but this is the age of criticism .


Ever yours ,

-- To Thomas Moore .


August 28 , 1813 .


Ay , my dear Moore , `` there was a time '' -- I have heard of your tricks , when `` you was campaigning at the King of Bohemy . ''
[ 1 ]


I am much mistaken if , some fine London spring , about the year 1815 , that time does not come again .
After all , we must end in marriage  and I can conceive nothing more delightful than such a state in the country , reading the county newspaper , etc. , and kissing one 's wife 's maid .
Seriously , I would incorporate with any woman of decent demeanour to-morrow -- that is , I would a month ago , but , at present , --


Why do n't you `` parody that Ode ? ''
-- Do you think [ 2 ] I should be tetchy ?
or have you done it , and wo n't tell me ?
-- You are quite right about Giamschid , and I have reduced it to a dissyllable within this half hour [ 3 ] .


I am glad to hear you talk of Richardson [ 4 ] , because it tells me what you wo n't -- that you are going to beat Lucien .
At least tell me how far you have proceeded .
Do you think me less interested about your works , or less sincere than our friend Ruggiero ?
I am not -- and never was .
In that thing of mine , the English Bards , at the time when I was angry with all the world , I never `` disparaged your parts , '' although I did not know you personally  -- and have always regretted that you do n't give us an entire work , and not sprinkle yourself in detached pieces -- beautiful , I allow , and quite alone in our language , but still giving us a right to expect a Shah Nameh [ 5 ] ( is that the name ? )
as well as gazelles .
Stick to the East  -- the oracle , Stael , told me it was the only poetical policy .
The North , South , and West , have all been exhausted  but from the East , we have nothing but Southey 's unsaleables , -- and these he has contrived to spoil , by adopting only their most outrageous fictions .
His personages do n't interest us , and yours will .
You will have no competitor  and , if you had , you ought to be glad of it .
The little I have done in that way is merely a `` voice in the wilderness '' for you  and if it has had any success , that also will prove that the public are orientalising , and pave the path for you .


I have been thinking of a story , grafted on the amours of a Peri and a mortal -- something like , only more philanthropical than , Cazotte 's Diable Amoureux [ 6 ] .


It would require a good deal of poesy , and tenderness is not my forte .
For that , and other reasons , I have given up the idea , and merely suggest it to you , because , in intervals of your greater work , I think it a subject you might make much of [ 7 ] .


If you want any more books , there is `` Castellan 's Moeurs des Ottomans , '' the best compendium of the kind I ever met with , in six small tomes [ 8 ] .


I am really taking a liberty by talking in this style to my `` elders and my betters  '' -- pardon it , and do n't Rochefoucault [ 9 ] my motives .


[ Footnote 1 : Jerry Sneak , in Foote 's ` Mayor of Garratt ' ( act ii . )
, says to Major Sturgeon , `` I heard of your tricks at the King of Bohemy . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 :


`` The Ode of Horace --


` Natis in usum laetitiae , ' etc. 


some passages of which I told him might be parodied , in allusion to some of his late adventures :


` Quanta laboras in Charybdi !
Digne puer meliore flamma ! ' ''


( Moore . ) ]


[ Footnote 3 :


`` In his first edition of ` The Giaour ' he had used this word as a trisyllable -- ` Bright as the gem of Giamschid ' -- but on my remarking to him , upon the authority of Richardson 's Persian Dictionary , that this was incorrect , he altered it to ` Bright as the ruby of Giamschid . '
On seeing this , however , I wrote to him , ` that , as the comparison of his heroine 's eye to a `` ruby '' might unluckily call up the idea of its being bloodshot , he had better change the line to `` Bright as the jewel of Giamschid  '' ' which he accordingly did in the following edition '' ( Moore ) .


In the ` Shah Nameh ' , Giamschid is the fourth sovereign of the ancient Persians , and ruled seven hundred years .
His jewel was a green chrysolite , the reflection of which gives to the sky its blue-green colour .
Byron probably changed to `` ruby '' on the authority of ` Vathek ' ( p. 58 , ed .
1856 ) , where Beckford writes ,


`` Then all the riches this place contains , as well as the carbuncle of Giamschid , shall be hers . '' ]


[ Footnote 4 : Moore 's reference ( see ` note ' 1 ) to John Richardson 's ` Dictionary of Persian , Arabic , and English ' ( 1777 ) , suggests to Byron that Moore was at work on an Oriental poem , probably ` Lalla Rookh ' , which would surpass the ` Charlemagne ' of Lucien Buonaparte . ]


[ Footnote 5 : The ` Shah Nameh ' is a rhymed history of Persia , in which occurs the famous episode of Sohrab and Rustem .
It was written in thirty years by Abul Kasim Firdausi , the last name being given to him by Sultan Mahmud because he had shed over the court at Ghizni the delights of `` Paradise . ''
Firdausi is said to have lived about 950 to 1030 .
( See The ` Shah Nameh ' , translated and abridged by James Atkinson . ) ]


[ Footnote 6 : Jacques Cazotte ( 1720-1792 ) wrote ` La Patte du Chat ' ( 1741 )  ` Mille et une Fadaises ' ( 1742 )  ` Observations sur la lettre de Rousseau au sujet de la Musique Francaise ' ( 1754 )  and other works .
` Le Diable Amoureux ' appeared in 1772 .
Cazotte escaped the September Massacres at the Abbaye in 1792 , through the heroism of his daughter , but was executed on the twenty-fifth of the same month . ]

`` I had already , singularly enough , anticipated this suggestion , by making the daughter of a Peri the heroine of one of my stories , and detailing the love adventures of her aerial parent in an episode .
In acquainting Lord Byron with this circumstance , in my answer to the above letter , I added , ` All I ask of your friendship is -- not that you will abstain from Peris on my account , for that is too much to ask of human ( or , at least , author 's ) nature -- but that , whenever you mean to pay your addresses to any of these aerial ladies , you will , at once , tell me so , frankly and instantly , and let me , at least , have my choice whether I shall be desperate enough to go on , with such a rival , or at once surrender the whole race into your hands , and take , for the future , to Antediluvians with Mr. Montgomery ' ''

August -- September , I mean -- 1 , 1813 .


I send you , begging your acceptance , Castellan , and three vols .
on Turkish literature [ 1 ] , not yet looked into .
The last I will thank you to read , extract what you want , and return in a week , as they are lent to me by that brightest of Northern constellations , Mackintosh [ 2 ] , -- amongst many other kind things into which India has warmed him  for I am sure your home Scotsman is of a less genial description .


Your Peri , my dear M. , is sacred and inviolable  I have no idea of touching the hem of her petticoat .
Your affectation of a dislike to encounter me is so flattering , that I begin to think myself a very fine fellow .
But you are laughing at me -- `` Stap my vitals , Tam !
thou art a very impudent person  '' [ 3 ] and , if you are not laughing at me , you deserve to be laughed at .
Seriously , what on earth can you , or have you , to dread from any poetical flesh breathing ?
It really puts me out of humour to hear you talk thus .


The Giaour I have added to a good deal  but still in foolish fragments .
It contains about 1200 lines , or rather more -- now printing .
You will allow me to send you a copy .
You delight me much by telling me that I am in your good graces , and more particularly as to temper  for , unluckily , I have the reputation of a very bad one .
But they say the devil is amusing when pleased , and I must have been more venomous than the old serpent , to have hissed or stung in your company .
It may be , and would appear to a third person , an incredible thing , but I know you will believe me when I say , that I am as anxious for your success as one human being can be for another 's , -- as much as if I had never scribbled a line .
Surely the field of fame is wide enough for all  and if it were not , I would not willingly rob my neighbour of a rood of it .
Now you have a pretty property of some thousand acres there , and when you have passed your present Inclosure Bill , your income will be doubled , ( there 's a metaphor , worthy of a Templar , namely , pert and low , ) while my wild common is too remote to incommode you , and quite incapable of such fertility .
I send you ( which return per post , as the printer would say ) a curious letter from a friend of mine [ 4 ] , which will let you into the origin of The Giaour .
Write soon .


Ever , dear Moore , yours most entirely , etc. .


P.S. -- This letter was written to me on account of a different story circulated by some gentlewomen of our acquaintance , a little too close to the text .
The part erased contained merely some Turkish names , and circumstantial evidence of the girl 's detection , not very important or decorous .

[ Footnote 4 : The following is the letter to which Byron refers :


Albany , Monday , August 31 , 1813 .


`` MY DEAR BYRON , -- You have requested me to tell you all that I heard at Athens about the affair of that girl who was so near being put an end to while you were there  you have asked me to remember every circumstance , in the remotest degree relating to it , which I heard .
In compliance with your wishes , I write to you all I heard , and I can not imagine it to be very far from the fact , as the circumstances happened only a day or two before I arrived at Athens , and , consequently , was a matter of common conversation at the time .


`` The new governor , unaccustomed to have the same intercourse with the Christians as his predecessor , had , of course , the barbarous Turkish ideas with regard to women .
In consequence , and in compliance with the strict letter of the Mohammedan law , he ordered this girl to be sewed up in a sack , and thrown into the sea -- as is , indeed , quite customary at Constantinople .
As you were returning from bathing in the Piraeus , you met the procession going down to execute the sentence of the Waywode on this unhappy girl .
Report continues to say , that on finding out what the object of their journey was , and who was the miserable sufferer , you immediately interfered  and on some delay in obeying your orders , you were obliged to inform the leader of the escort that force should make him comply  that , on further hesitation , you drew a pistol , and told him , that if he did not immediately obey your orders , and come back with you to the Aga 's house , you would shoot him dead .
On this the man turned about and went with you to the governor 's house  here you succeeded , partly by personal threats , and partly by bribery and entreaty , in procuring her pardon , on condition of her leaving Athens .
I was told that you then conveyed her in safety to the convent , and despatched her off at night to Thebes , where she found a safe asylum .
Such is the story I heard , as nearly as I can recollect it at present .
Should you wish to ask me any further questions about it , I shall be very ready and willing to answer them .


`` I remain , my dear Byron ,


`` Yours very sincerely ,


`` Sligo '' . ]

September 2nd , 1813 .


My dear Webster , -- You are just the same generous and I fear careless gentleman of the years of indifferent memory 1806 .
I --  but I must not burthen you with my entire household .
Joe [ 1 ] is , I believe , necessary for the present as a fixture , to keep possession till every thing is arranged  and were it otherwise , you do n't know what a perplexity he would prove -- honest and faithful , but fearfully superannuated : now this I ought and do bear , but as he has not been fifty years in your family , it would be rather hard to convert your mansion into a hospital for decayed domestics .
Rushton is , or may be made useful , and I am less compunctious on his account .


`` Will I be Godfather ? ''
[ 2 ]


Yea , verily !
I believe it is the only species of parentage I shall ever encounter , for all my acquaintance , Powerscourt , Jocelyn , yourself , Delawarr , Stanhope , with a long list of happy etceteras , are married  most of them my juniors too , and I as single and likely to remain so as , nay more than , if I were seventy .


If it is a girl why not also ?
Georgina , or even Byron will make a classical name for a spinster , if Mr. Richardson 's Sir Charles Grandison is any authority in your estimation .


My ship is not settled .
My passage in the Boyne was only for one Servant , and would not do , of course .
You ask after the expense , a question no less interesting to the married than the single .
Unless things are much altered , no establishment in the Mediterranean Countries could amount to the quarter of the expenditure requisite in England for the same or an inferior household .


I am interrupted , and have only time to offer my best thanks for all your good wishes and intentions , and to beg you will believe me ,


Equally yours ever ,


B .


P.S. -- Rushton shall be sent on Saturday next .

You need not tie yourself down to a day with Toderini , but send him at your leisure , having anatomised him into such annotations as you want  I do not believe that he has ever undergone that process before , which is the best reason for not sparing him now .


Rogers has returned to town , but not yet recovered of the ` Quarterly ' .
What fellows these reviewers are !
`` these bugs do fear us all . ''
[ 1 ]


They made you fight , and me ( the milkiest of men ) a satirist , and will end by making Rogers madder than Ajax .
I have been reading ` Memory ' again , the other day , and Hope together , and retain all my preference of the former [ 2 ] .


His elegance is really wonderful -- there is no such thing as a vulgar line in his book .


What say you to Buonaparte ?
Remember , I back him against the field , barring catalepsy and the Elements .
Nay , I almost wish him success against all countries but this , -- were it only to choke the ` Morning Post ' , and his undutiful father-in-law , with that rebellious bastard of Scandinavian adoption , Bernadotte .
Rogers wants me to go with him on a crusade to the Lakes , and to besiege you on our way .
This last is a great temptation , but I fear it will not be in my power , unless you would go on with one of us somewhere -- no matter where .
It is too late for Matlock , but we might hit upon some scheme , high life or low , -- the last would be much the best for amusement .
I am so sick of the other , that I quite sigh for a cider-cellar [ 3 ] , or a cruise in a smuggler 's sloop .


You can not wish more than I do that the Fates were a little more accommodating to our parallel lines , which prolong ad infinitum without coming a jot nearer .
I almost wish I were married , too -- which is saying much .
All my friends , seniors and juniors , are in for it , and ask me to be godfather , -- the only species of parentage which , I believe , will ever come to my share in a lawful way  and , in an unlawful one , by the blessing of Lucina , we can never be certain , -- though the parish may .
I suppose I shall hear from you to-morrow .
If not , this goes as it is  but I leave room for a P.S. , in case any thing requires an answer .


Ever , etc. .


No letter -- n'importe .
Rogers thinks the Quarterly will be at me this time  if so , it shall be a war of extermination -- no quarter .
From the youngest devil down to the oldest woman of that review , all shall perish by one fatal lampoon .
The ties of nature shall be torn asunder , for I will not even spare my bookseller  nay , if one were to include readers also , all the better .

[ Footnote 2 : Byron quoted to Lady Blessington `` some passages from the ` Pleasures of Hope ' , which he said was a poem full of beauties ... ` The ` Pleasures of Memory ' is a very beautiful poem ' ( said Byron ) , ` harmonious , finished , and chaste  it contains not a single meretricious ornament ' '' ( ` Conversations ' , pp. 352 , 353 ) . ]

Mr. Wheatley , in ` London Past and Present , sub voce ' `` Maiden Lane , '' says that the


`` tavern continued to be frequented by young men , and ` much in vogue for devilled kidneys , oysters , and Welch rabbits , cigars , `` goes '' of brandy , and great supplies of London stout ' ( also for comic songs ) , till it was absorbed in the extensions of the Adelphi Theatre . '' ]

September 8 , 1813 .


I am sorry to see Toderini again so soon , for fear your scrupulous conscience should have prevented you from fully availing yourself of his spoils .
By this coach I send you a copy of that awful pamphlet The Giaour , which has never procured me half so high a compliment as your modest alarm .
You will ( if inclined in an evening ) perceive that I have added much in quantity , -- a circumstance which may truly diminish your modesty upon the subject .


You stand certainly in great need of a `` lift '' with Mackintosh .
My dear Moore , you strangely under-rate yourself .
I should conceive it an affectation in any other  but I think I know you well enough to believe that you do n't know your own value .
However , 't is a fault that generally mends  and , in your case , it really ought .
I have heard him speak of you as highly as your wife could wish  and enough to give all your friends the jaundice .


Yesterday I had a letter from Ali Pacha !
brought by Dr. Holland , who is just returned from Albania [ 1 ] .
It is in Latin , and begins `` Excellentissime nec non Carissime , '' and ends about a gun he wants made for him  -- it is signed `` Ali Vizir . ''
What do you think he has been about ?
H. tells me that , last spring , he took a hostile town , where , forty-two years ago , his mother and sisters were treated as Miss Cunigunde [ 2 ] was by the Bulgarian cavalry .
He takes the town , selects all the survivors of this exploit -- children , grandchildren , etc. to the tune of six hundred , and has them shot before his face .
Recollect , he spared the rest of the city , and confined himself to the Tarquin pedigree [ 3 ] , -- which is more than I would .
So much for `` dearest friend . ''

My dear Webster , -- I shall not resist your second invitation , and shortly after the receipt of this you may expect me .
You will excuse me from the races .
As a guest I have no `` antipathies '' and few preferences ... You wo n't mind , however , my not dining with you -- every day at least .
When we meet , we can talk over our respective plans : mine is very short and simple  viz .
to sail when I can get a passage .
If I remained in England I should live in the Country , and of course in the vicinity of those whom I knew would be most agreeable .


I did not know that Jack 's graven image [ 1 ] was at Newstead .
If it be , pray transfer it to Aston .
It is my hope to see you so shortly , tomorrow or next day , that I will not now trouble you with my speculations .


Ever yours very faithfully ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- I do n't know how I came to sign myself with the `` i. '' It is the old spelling , and I sometimes slip into it .
When I say I ca n't dine with you , I mean that sometimes I do n't dine at all .

I remained with him next day and set off last night for London , which I reached at three in the morning .
Tonight I shall leave it again , perhaps for Aston or Newstead .
I have not yet determined , nor does it much matter .
As you perhaps care more on the subject than I do , I will tell you when I know myself .


When my departure is arranged , and I can get this long-evaded passage , you will be able to tell me whether I am to expect a visit or not , and I can come for or meet you as you think best .

It will go to night  pray let your retainers enquire after it .

September 27 , 1813 .


Thomas Moore , -- ( Thou wilt never be called `` true Thomas , '' [ 1 ] like he of Ercildoune , ) why do n't you write to me ?
-- as you wo n't , I must .
I was near you at Aston the other day , and hope I soon shall be again .
If so , you must and shall meet me , and go to Matlock and elsewhere , and take what , in flash dialect , is poetically termed `` a lark , '' with Rogers and me for accomplices .
Yesterday , at Holland House , I was introduced to Southey -- the best-looking bard I have seen for some time .
To have that poet 's head and shoulders , I would almost have written his Sapphics .
He is certainly a prepossessing person to look on , and a man of talent , and all that , and -- there is his eulogy .


-- read me part of a letter from you .
By the foot of Pharaoh , I believe there was abuse , for he stopped short , so he did , after a fine saying about our correspondence , and looked -- I wish I could revenge myself by attacking you , or by telling you that I have had to defend you -- an agreeable way which one 's friends have of recommending themselves by saying -- `` Ay , ay , I gave it Mr. Such-a-one for what he said about your being a plagiary , and a rake , and so on . ''
But do you know that you are one of the very few whom I never have the satisfaction of hearing abused , but the reverse  -- and do you suppose I will forgive that ?


I have been in the country , and ran away from the Doncaster races .
It is odd , -- I was a visitor in the same house [ 2 ] which came to my sire as a residence with Lady Carmarthen ( with whom he adulterated before his majority -- by the by , remember she was not my mamma ) , -- and they thrust me into an old room , with a nauseous picture over the chimney , which I should suppose my papa regarded with due respect , and which , inheriting the family taste , I looked upon with great satisfaction .
I stayed a week with the family , and behaved very well -- though the lady of the house is young , and religious , and pretty , and the master is my particular friend .
I felt no wish for any thing but a poodle dog , which they kindly gave me .
Now , for a man of my courses not even to have coveted , is a sign of great amendment .
Pray pardon all this nonsense , and do n't `` snub me when I 'm in spirits . ''
[ 3 ]


Ever yours ,


BN .


Here 's an impromptu for you by a `` person of quality , '' written last week , on being reproached for low spirits :


When from the heart where Sorrow sits , Her dusky shadow mounts too high , And o'er the changing aspect flits , And clouds the brow , or fills the eye : Heed not that gloom , which soon shall sink  My Thoughts their dungeon know too well -- Back to my breast the wanderers shrink , And bleed within their silent cell .

September 30th , 1813 .


My dear Webster , -- Thanks for your letter .
I had answered it by anticipation last night , and this is but a postscript to my reply .
My yesterday 's contained some advice , which I now see you do n't want , and hope you never will .


So !
Petersham [ 1 ] has not joined you .
I pity the poor women .
No one can properly repair such a deficiency  but rather than such a chasm should be left utterly unfathomable , I , even I , the most awkward of attendants and deplorable of danglers , would have been of your forlorn hope , on this expedition .
Nothing but business , and the notion of my being utterly superfluous in so numerous a party , would have induced me to resign so soon my quiet apartments never interrupted but by the sound , or the more harmonious barking of Nettle , and clashing of billiard balls .


On Sunday I shall leave town and mean to join you immediately .
I have not yet had my sister 's answer to Lady Frances 's very kind invitation , but expect it tomorrow .
Pray assure Lady Frances that I never can forget the obligation conferred upon me in this respect , and I trust that even Lady Catherine [ 2 ] will , in this instance , not question my `` stability . ''


I yesterday wrote you rather a long tirade about La Comptesse , but you seem in no immediate peril  I will therefore burn it .
Yet I do n't know why I should , as you may relapse : it shall e ` en go .


I have been passing my time with Rogers and Sir James Mackintosh  and once at Holland House I met Southey  he is a person of very epic appearance , and has a fine head -- as far as the outside goes , and wants nothing but taste to make the inside equally attractive .


Ever , my dear W. , yours ,


Biron .


P.S. -- I read your letter thus : `` the Countess is miserable '' instead of which it is `` inexorable '' a very different thing .
The best way is to let her alone  she must be a diablesse by what you told me .
You have probably not bid high enough .
Now you are not , perhaps , of my opinion  but I would not give the tithe of a Birmingham farthing for a woman who could or would be purchased , nor indeed for any woman quoad mere woman  that is to say , unless I loved her for something more than her sex .
If she loves , a little pique is not amiss , nor even if she do n't  the next thing to a woman 's love in a man 's favour is her hatred , -- a seeming paradox but true .
Get them once out of indifference and circumstance , and their passions will do wonders for a dasher which I suppose you are , though I seldom had the impudence or patience to follow them up .

In his collection of snuff-boxes , one of the finest in England , he was supposed to have a box for every day in the year .
Gronow ( ` ibid ' . )


`` heard him , on the occasion of a delightful old light-blue Sevres box he was using being admired , say , in his lisping way , ` Yes , it is a nice summer box , but would not do for winter wear . ' ''

My Dear H. , -- I leave town again for Aston on Sunday , but have messages for you .
Lord Holland desired me repeatedly to bring you  he wants to know you much , and begged me to say so : you will like him .
I had an invitation for you to dinner there this last Sunday , and Rogers is perpetually screaming because you do n't call , and wanted you also to dine with him on Wednesday last .
Yesterday we had Curran there -- who is beyond all conception !
and Mackintosh and the wits are to be seen at H. H. constantly , so that I think you would like their society .
I will be a judge between you and the attorneo .
So B [ utler ] may mention me to Lucien if he still adheres to his opinion .
Pray let Rogers be one  he has the best taste extant .
Bland 's nuptials delight me  if I had the least hand in bringing them about it will be a subject of selfish satisfaction to me these three weeks .

October 2 , 1813 .


You have not answered some six letters of mine .
This , therefore , is my penultimate .
I will write to you once more , but , after that -- I swear by all the saints -- I am silent and supercilious .
I have met Curran [ 1 ] at Holland House -- he beats every body  -- his imagination is beyond human , and his humour ( it is difficult to define what is wit ) perfect .
Then he has fifty faces , and twice as many voices , when he mimics -- I never met his equal .
Now , were I a woman , and eke a virgin , that is the man I should make my Scamander [ 2 ] .


He is quite fascinating .
Remember , I have met him but once  and you , who have known him long , may probably deduct from my panegyric .
I almost fear to meet him again , lest the impression should be lowered .
He talked a great deal about you -- a theme never tiresome to me , nor any body else that I know .
What a variety of expression he conjures into that naturally not very fine countenance of his !
He absolutely changes it entirely .
I have done -- for I ca n't describe him , and you know him .
On Sunday I return to Aston , where I shall not be far from you .
Perhaps I shall hear from you in the mean time .
Good night .


Saturday morn .
-- Your letter has cancelled all my anxieties .
I did not suspect you in earnest .
Modest again !
Because I do n't do a very shabby thing , it seems , I `` do n't fear your competition . ''
If it were reduced to an alternative of preference , I should dread you , as much as Satan does Michael .
But is there not room enough in our respective regions ?
Go on -- it will soon be my turn to forgive .
To-day I dine with Mackintosh and Mrs. Stale -- as John Bull may be pleased to denominate Corinne -- whom I saw last night , at Covent Garden , yawning over the humour of Falstaff .


The reputation of `` gloom , '' if one 's friends are not included in the reputants , is of great service  as it saves one from a legion of impertinents , in the shape of common-place acquaintance .
But thou know ` st I can be a right merry and conceited fellow , and rarely larmoyant .
Murray shall reinstate your line forthwith .
[ 3 ]


I believe the blunder in the motto was mine  -- and yet I have , in general , a memory for you , and am sure it was rightly printed at first .


I do `` blush '' very often , if I may believe Ladies H. and M.  -- but luckily , at present , no one sees me .
Adieu .

John Philpot Curran ( 1750-1817 ) , after accepting the Mastership of the Rolls in Ireland ( 1806 ) , spent much of his time in England .
He retired from the Bench , where he never shone , in 1814 .


In Byron 's ` Detached Thoughts ' ( 1821 ) occurs the following passage :


`` I was much struck with the simplicity of Grattan 's manners in private life .
They were odd , but they were natural .
Curran used to take him off , bowing to the very ground , and ` thanking God that he had no peculiarities of gesture or appearance , ' in a way irresistibly ludicrous .
Rogers used to call him a ` Sentimental Harlequin  ' but Rogers backbites everybody , and Curran , who used to quiz his great friend Godwin to his very face , would hardly respect a fair mark of mimicry in another .
To be sure , Curran was admirable !
to hear his description of the examination of an Irish witness was next to hearing his own speeches  the latter I never heard , but I have the former . ''


Elsewhere ( ` ibid ' . )
he returns to the subject :


`` Curran !
Curran 's the man who struck me most -- such imagination !
There never was anything like it , that ever I saw or heard of .
His published life -- his published speeches -- give you no idea of the man  none at all .
He was a Machine of imagination , as some one said that Piron was an ` Epigrammatic Machine . '
I did not see a great deal of Curran , -- only in 1813  but I met him at home ( for he used to call on me ) , and in society , at Mackintosh 's , Holland House , etc. , etc. .
And he was wonderful , even to me , who had seen many remarkable men of the time . ''


The following notes on this passage are in the handwriting of Walter Scott :


`` When Mathews first began to imitate Curran in Dublin -- in society , I mean , -- Curran sent for him and said , the moment he entered the room , ` Mr. Mathews , you are a first-rate artist , and , since you are to do my picture , pray allow me to give you a sitting . '
Everyone knows how admirably Mathews succeeded in furnishing at last the portraiture begun under these circumstances .
No one was more aware of the truth than Curran himself .
In his latter and feeble days , he was riding in Hyde Park one morning , bowed down over the saddle and bitterly dejected in his air .
Mathews happened to observe and saluted him .
Curran stopped his horse for a moment , squeezed Charles by the hand , and said in that deep whisper which the comedian so exquisitely mimics , ` Do n't speak to me , my dear Mathews  you are the only Curran now ! ' ''


`` Did you know Curran ? ''
asked Byron of Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , p. 176 )  `` he was the most wonderful person I ever saw .
In him was combined an imagination the most brilliant and profound , with a flexibility and wit that would have justified the observation applied to -- , that his heart was in his head . ''


Moore ( ` Journal , etc. ' , vol .
i. p. 40 ) quotes a couplet by Mrs. Battier upon Curran , which `` commemorates in a small compass two of his most striking peculiarities , namely , his very unprepossessing personal appearance , and his great success , notwithstanding , in pursuits of gallantry ... :


'' ` For though his monkey face might fail to woo her , Yet , ah !
his monkey tricks would quite undo her . ' '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : In the spurious letters of AEschines ( Letter x. ) is a passage which explains the allusion .


`` It is the custom of maidens , on the eve of their marriage , to wash in the waters of the Scamander , and then to utter this almost sacred formula ,


` Take , O Scamander , my virginity '


( [ Greek : to epos touto hosper hieron ti epilegein , Lhabe mou Scamandre taen parthenian ) . '' ]


[ Footnote 3 :


`` The motto to ` The Giaour ' :


One fatal remembrance -- one sorrow that throws Its bleak shade alike o'er our joys and our woes , ' etc. .


`` which is taken from one of the ` Irish Melodies ' , had been quoted by him incorrectly in the first editions of the poem '' .

Stilton , Oct. 3 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- I have just recollected an alteration you may make in the proof to be sent to Aston .
-- Among the lines on Hassan 's Serai , not far from the beginning , is this :


Unmeet for Solitude to share .


Now to share implies more than one , and Solitude is a single gentlewoman  it must be thus :


For many a gilded chamber 's there , Which Solitude might well forbear 


and so on .
-- My address is Aston Hall , Rotherham .
Will you adopt this correction ?
and pray accept a cheese from me for your trouble .
Ever yours , B .


P.S. -- I leave this to your discretion  if any body thinks the old line a good one or the cheese a bad one , do n't accept either .
But , in that case , the word share is repeated soon after in the line :


To share the Master 's `` bread and salt  ''


and must be altered to :


To break the Master 's bread and salt .


This is not so well , though -- confound it !
If the old line stands , let the other run thus :


Nor there will weary traveller halt , To bless the sacred `` bread and salt . ''


Note .
-- To partake of food -- to break bread and taste salt with your host -- ensures the safety of the guest  even though an enemy , his person from that moment becomes sacred .


There is another additional note sent yesterday -- on the Priest in the Confessional .

Dear Sir , -- I am disposed to advance a loan of L1000 to James Webster Wedderburne Webster , Esqre. , of Aston Hall , York County , and request you will address to me there a bond and judgement to be signed by the said as soon as possible .
Of Claughton 's payments I know nothing further , and the demands on myself I know also  but W. is a very old friend of mine , and a man of property , and , as I can command the money , he shall have it .
I do not at all wish to inconvenience you , and I also know that , when we balance accounts , it will be much in your favour  but if you could replace the sum at Hoare 's from my advance of two thousand eight hundred in July , it would be a favour  or , still better , if C. makes further payments , which will render it unnecessary .
Do n't let the first part of the last sentence embarrass you at all  the last part about Claughton I would wish you to attend to .

Dear Sir , -- You must look ` The Giaour ' again over carefully  there are a few lapses , particularly in the last page , -- `` I know 't was false  she could not die  '' it was , and ought to be -- `` knew . ''
Pray observe this and similar mistakes .


I have received and read the ` British Review ' [ 1 ] .


I really think the writer in most parts very right .
The only mortifying thing is the accusation of imitation .


Crabbe 's passage I never saw  and Scott I no further meant to follow than in his lyric measure , which is Gray 's , Milton 's , and any one 's who likes it .
` The Giaour ' is certainly a bad character , but not dangerous : and I think his fate and his feelings will meet with few proselytes .
I shall be very glad to hear from or of you , when you please  but do n't put yourself out of your way on my account .


Yours ever ,


B .


[ Footnote 1 : ` The British Review ' ( No .
ix . )
criticized ` The Giaour ' severely ( pp. 132-145 ) .
`` Lord Byron , '' it says , `` has had the bad taste to imitate Mr. Walter Scott '' ( p. 135 ) .
Further on ( p. 139 ) it charges him with borrowing a simile from Crabbe 's ` Resentment ' .
The passage to which the reviewer alludes will be found in lines 11-16 of that poem :


`` Those are like wax -- apply them to the fire , Melting , they take th ' impressions you desire : Easy to mould , and fashion as you please , And again moulded with an equal ease : Like smelted iron these the forms retain  But , once impress'd , will never melt again . '' ]

My Dear Sir , -- I hope you will consider , when I venture on any request , that it is the reverse of a certain Dedication , and is addressed , not to `` The Editor of the ` Quarterly Review ' '' but to Mr. Gifford .
You will understand this , and on that point I need trouble you no farther .


You have been good enough to look at a thing of mine in MS. -- a Turkish story , and I should feel gratified if you would do it the same favour in its probationary state of printing .
It was written , I can not say for amusement , nor `` obliged by hunger and request of friends , '' [ 1 ] but in a state of mind , from circumstances which occasionally occur to `` us youth , '' that rendered it necessary for me to apply my mind to something , any thing but reality  and under this not very brilliant inspiration it was composed .
Being done , and having at least diverted me from myself , I thought you would not perhaps be offended if Mr. Murray forwarded it to you .
He has done so , and to apologise for his doing so a second time is the object of my present letter .


I beg you will not send me any answer .
I assure you very sincerely I know your time to be occupied , and it is enough , more than enough , if you read  you are not to be bored with the fatigue of answers .


A word to Mr. Murray will be sufficient , and send it either to the flames or


`` A hundred hawkers ' load , On wings of wind to fly or fall abroad . ''


It deserves no better than the first , as the work of a week , and scribbled ` stans pede in uno ' [ 2 ] , ( by the by , the only foot I have to stand on )  and I promise never to trouble you again under forty cantos , and a voyage between each .
Believe me ever ,

Nov. 12 , 1813 .


Two friends of mine ( Mr. Rogers and Mr. Sharpe ) have advised me not to risk at present any single publication separately , for various reasons .
As they have not seen the one in question , they can have no bias for or against the merits ( if it has any ) or the faults of the present subject of our conversation .
You say all the last of ` The Giaour ' [ 1 ] are gone -- at least out of your hands .
Now , if you think of publishing any new edition with the last additions which have not yet been before the reader ( I mean distinct from the two-volume publication ) , we can add '' ` The Bride of Abydos ' , '' which will thus steal quietly into the world [ 2 ] : if liked , we can then throw off some copies for the purchasers of former `` Giaours  '' and , if not , I can omit it in any future publication .
What think you ?
I really am no judge of those things  and , with all my natural partiality for one 's own productions , I would rather follow any one 's judgment than my own .


P.S. -- Pray let me have the proofs .
I sent all to-night .
I have some alterations that I have thought of that I wish to make speedily .
I hope the proof will be on separate pages , and not all huddled together on a mile-long , ballad-singing sheet , as those of ` The Giaour ' sometimes are : for then I ca n't read them distinctly .


[ Footnote 1 : In ` Accepted Addresses  or , Premium Poetarum ' , pp. 50-52 ( 1813 ) , ` Address ' xvii .
is from `` Lord B -- n to J. M -- y , Book-seller . ''
The address itself runs as follows :


`` A Turkish tale I shall unfold , A sweeter tale was never told  But then the facts , I must allow , Are in the east not common now  Tho ' in the ` olden time , ' the scene My Goaour ( sic ) describes had often been .
What is the cause !
Perhaps the fair Are now more cautious than they were  Perhaps the Christians not so bold , So enterprising as of old .
No matter what the cause may be , It is a subject fit for me .


`` Take my disjointed fragments then , The offspring of a willing pen .
And give them to the public , pray , On or before the month of May .
Yes , my disjointed fragments take , But do not ask how much they 'll make .
Perhaps not fifty pages -- well , I in a little space can tell Th ' adventures of an infidel  Of quantity I never boast , For quality 's , approved of most .


`` It is a handsome sum to touch , Induces authors to write much  But in this much , alas !
my friend , How little is there to commend .
So , Mr. M -- y , I disdain , To sacrifice my muse for gain .
I wish it to be understood , The little which I write is good .


`` I do not like the quarto size , Th ' octavo , therefore , I advise .
Then do not , Mr. M -- y , fail , To publish this , my Turkish Tale  For tho ' the volume may be thin , A thousand readers it will win  And when my pages they explore , They 'll gladly read them o'er and o'er  And all the ladies , I engage , With tears will moisten every page . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : John Murray writes , in an undated letter to Byron ,


`` Mr. Canning returned the poem to-day with very warm expressions of delight .
I told him your delicacy as to separate publication , of which he said you should remove every apprehension . '' ]

Will you forward the letter to Mr. Gifford with the proof ?
There is an alteration I may make in Zuleika 's speech , in second canto ( the only one of hers in that canto ) .

And curse -- if I could curse -- the day .


It must be :


And mourn -- I dare not curse -- the day , That saw my solitary birth , etc. , etc. .

Or ,


And } gilds/tints { the hope of Morning with its ray 


Or ,


And gilds to-morrow 's hope with heavenly ray .

Certainly .
Do you suppose that no one but the Galileans are acquainted with Adam , and Eve , and Cain , [ 1 ] and Noah ?
-- Surely , I might have had Solomon , and Abraham , and David , and even Moses , or the other .
When you know that Zuleika is the Persian poetical name for Potiphar 's wife , on whom and Joseph there is a long poem in the Persian , this will not surprise you .
If you want authority look at Jones , D'Herbelot , ` Vathek ' , or the notes to the ` Arabian Nights '  and , if you think it necessary , model this into a note .


Alter , in the inscription , `` the most affectionate respect , '' to `` with every sentiment of regard and respect , ''

DEAR SIR , -- Mr. Hodgson has looked over and stopped , or rather pointed , this revise , which must be the one to print from .
He has also made some suggestions , with most of which I have complied , as he has always , for these ten years , been a very sincere , and by no means ( at times ) flattering critic of mine .
He likes it ( you will think flatteringly , in this instance ) better than ` The Giaour ' , but doubts ( and so do I ) its being so popular  but , contrary to some others , advises a separate publication .
On this we can easily decide .
I confess I like the double form better .
Hodgson says , it is better versified than any of the others  which is odd , if true , as it has cost me less time ( though more hours at a time ) than any attempt I ever made .


Yours ever , B .


P.S. -- Do attend to the punctuation : I ca n't , for I do n't know a comma -- at least where to place one .


That Tory of a printer has omitted two lines of the opening , and perhaps more , which were in the MS. Will you , pray , give him a hint of accuracy ?

My Dear Sir , -- That you and I may distinctly understand each other on a subject , which , like `` the dreadful reckoning when men smile no more , '' [ 1 ] makes conversation not very pleasant , I think it as well to write a few lines on the topic .
-- Before I left town for Yorkshire , you said that you were ready and willing to give five hundred guineas for the copyright of ` The Giaour '  and my answer was -- from which I do not mean to recede -- that we would discuss the point at Christmas .
The new story may or may not succeed  the probability , under present circumstances , seems to be , that it may at least pay its expences -- but even that remains to be proved , and till it is proved one way or the other , we will say nothing about it .
Thus then be it : I will postpone all arrangement about it , and ` The Giaour ' also , till Easter , 1814  and you shall then , according to your own notions of fairness , make your own offer for the two .
At the same time , I do not rate the last in my own estimation at half ` The Giaour '  and according to your own notions of its worth and its success within the time mentioned , be the addition or deduction to or from whatever sum may be your proposal for the first , which has already had its success [ 2 ] .


My account with you since my last payment ( which I believe cleared it off within five pounds ) I presume has not much increased -- but whatever it is have the goodness to send it to me -- that I may at least meet you on even terms .


The pictures of Phillips I consider as mine , all three  and the one ( not the Arnaut ) of the two best is much at your service , if you will accept it as a present , from Yours very truly , BIRON .


P.S. -- The expence of engraving from the miniature send me in my account , as it was destroyed by my desire  and have the goodness to burn that detestable print from it immediately .

`` Makes '' is closer to the passage of Tacitus [ 1 ] , from which the line is taken , and is , besides , a stronger word than `` leaves . ''

The ` Morning Post ' says I am the author of ` Nourjahad ' [ 1 ] !!


This comes of lending the drawings for their dresses  but it is not worth a formal contradiction .
Besides , the criticisms on the supposition will , some of them , be quite amusing and furious .

` The Bride ' , such as it is , is my first entire composition of any length ( except the Satire , and be damned to it ) , for ` The Giaour ' is but a string of passages , and ` Childe Harold ' is , and I rather think always will be , unconcluded .
I return Mr. Hay 's note , with thanks to him and you .


There have been some epigrams on Mr. W [ ard ] : one I see to-day [ 3 ] .


The first I did not see , but heard yesterday .
The second seems very bad and Mr. P [ erry ] has placed it over your puff .
I only hope that Mr. W. does not believe that I had any connection with either .
The Regent is the only person on whom I ever expectorated an epigram , or ever should  and even if I were disposed that way , I like and value Mr. W. too well to allow my politics to contract into spleen , or to admire any thing intended to annoy him or his .
You need not take the trouble to answer this , as I shall see you in the course of the afternoon .


Yours very truly , B .


P.S. -- I have said this much about the epigrams , because I live so much in the opposite camp , and , from my post as an Engineer , might be suspected as the flinger of these hand Grenadoes  but with a worthy foe I am all for open war , and not this bush-fighting , and have [ not ] had , nor will have , any thing to do with it .
I do not know the author .

Tuesday evening , Nov. 30 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- For the sake of correctness , particularly in an Errata page , the alteration of the couplet I have just sent ( half an hour ago ) must take place , in spite of delay or cancel  let me see the proof early to-morrow .
I found out murmur to be a neuter verb , and have been obliged to alter the line so as to make it a substantive , thus :


The deepest murmur of this life shall be No sigh for Safety , but a prayer for thee !


Do n't send the copies to the country till this is all right .

November 30 , 1813 .


Since I last wrote to you , much has occurred , good , bad , and indifferent , -- not to make me forget you , but to prevent me from reminding you of one who , nevertheless , has often thought of you , and to whom your thoughts , in many a measure , have frequently been a consolation .
We were once very near neighbours this autumn  and a good and bad neighbourhood it has proved to me .
Suffice it to say , that your French quotation [ 1 ] was confoundedly to the purpose , -- though very unexpectedly pertinent , as you may imagine by what I said before , and my silence since .
However , `` Richard 's himself again , '' [ 2 ] and except all night and some part of the morning , I do n't think very much about the matter .


All convulsions end with me in rhyme  and to solace my midnights , I have scribbled another Turkish story [ 3 ] -- not a Fragment -- which you will receive soon after this .
It does not trench upon your kingdom in the least , and if it did , you would soon reduce me to my proper boundaries .
You will think , and justly , that I run some risk of losing the little I have gained in fame , by this further experiment on public patience  but I have really ceased to care on that head .
I have written this , and published it , for the sake of the employment , -- to wring my thoughts from reality , and take refuge in `` imaginings , '' however `` horrible  '' [ 4 ] and , as to success !
those who succeed will console me for a failure -- excepting yourself and one or two more , whom luckily I love too well to wish one leaf of their laurels a tint yellower .
This is the work of a week , and will be the reading of an hour to you , or even less , -- and so , let it go -- .


P.S. -- Ward and I talk of going to Holland .
I want to see how a Dutch canal looks after the Bosphorus .
Pray respond .


[ Footnote 1 : Moore wrote to Byron in 1813 an undated letter , in which the following passage occurs :


`` I am sorry I must wait till ` we are veterans ' before you will open to me ` the story of your wandering life , wherein you find more hours due to repentance ... than time hath told you yet . '
Is it so with you , or are you , like me , reprobate enough to look back with complacency on what you have done ?
I suppose repentance must bring up the rear with us all  but at present I should say with old Fontenelle , Si je recommencais ma carriere , je ferais tout ce que j' ai fait . '' ]

I have just heard that Knapp is acquainted with what I was but too happy in being enabled to do for you [ 1 ] .


Now , my dear Hn. , you , or Drury , must have told this , for , upon my own honour , not even to Scrope , nor to one soul , ( Drury knew it before ) have I said one syllable of the matter .
So do n't be out of humour with me about it , but you ca n't be more so than I am .
I am , however , glad of one thing  if you ever conceived it to be in the least an obligation , this disclosure most fairly and fully releases you from it :


`` To John I owe some obligation , But John unluckily thinks fit To publish it to all the nation , So John and I are more than quit . ''


And so there 's an end of the matter .


Ward wavers a little about the Dutch , till matters are more sedative , and the French more sedentary .


The ` Bride ' will blush upon you in a day or two  there is much , at least a little addition .
I am happy to say that Frere and Heber , and some other `` good men and true , '' have been kind enough to adopt the same opinion that you did .


Pray write when you like , and believe me ,


Ever yours ,


BYRON .


P.S. -- Murray has offered me a thousand guineas for the two ( ` Giaour ' and ` Bride ' ) , and told M ` e. de Stael that he had paid them to me !!
I should be glad to be able to tell her so too .
But the truth is , he would  but I thought the fair way was to decline it till May , and , at the end of 6 months , he can safely say whether he can afford it or not -- without running any risk by Speculation .
If he paid them now and lost by it , it would be hard .
If he gains , it will be time enough when he has already funded his profits .
But he needed not have told `` la Baronne '' such a devil of an uncalled for piece of -- premature truth , perhaps -- but , nevertheless , a lie in the mean time .


[ Footnote 1 : Hodgson , now engaged to Miss Tayler , was anxious to clear off his father 's liabilities .
Byron gave him from first to last the sum of L1500 for the purpose .
Hodgson , in a letter to his uncle , thus describes the gift ( ` Memoir of Rev. F. Hodgson ' , vol .
i. pp. 268 , 269 ) :


`` My noble-hearted friend , Lord Byron , after many offers of a similar kind , which I felt bound to refuse , has irresistibly in my present circumstances ... volunteered to pay all my debts , and within a few pounds it is done !
Oh , if you knew ( but you do know ) the exultation of heart , aye , and of head too , I feel at being free from these depressing embarrassments , you would , as I do , bless my dearest friend and brother Byron . '' ]

4 , Bennet St. , Dec. 2 , 1813 .


My dear Sir , -- Few things could be more welcome than your note , and on Saturday morning I will avail myself of your permission to thank you for it in person .
My time has not been passed , since we met , either profitably or agreeably .
A very short period after my last visit , an incident occurred with which , I fear , you are not unacquainted , as report , in many mouths and more than one paper , was busy with the topic .
That , naturally , gave me much uneasiness .
Then I nearly incurred a lawsuit on the sale of an estate  but that is now arranged : next -- but why should I go on with a series of selfish and silly details ?
I merely wish to assure you that it was not the frivolous forgetfulness of a mind , occupied by what is called pleasure ( not in the true sense of Epicurus ) , that kept me away  but a perception of my , then , unfitness to share the society of those whom I value and wish not to displease .
I hate being larmoyant , and making a serious face among those who are cheerful .


It is my wish that our acquaintance , or , if you please to accept it , friendship , may be permanent .
I have been lucky enough to preserve some friends from a very early period , and I hope , as I do not ( at least now ) select them lightly , I shall not lose them capriciously .
I have a thorough esteem for that independence of spirit [ 1 ] which you have maintained with sterling talent , and at the expense of some suffering .
You have not , I trust , abandoned the poem you were composing , when Moore and I partook of your hospitality in the summer .
I hope a time will come when he and I may be able to repay you in kind for the latter -- for the rhyme , at least in quantity , you are in arrear to both .


Believe me , very truly and affectionately yours ,


Byron .


[ Footnote 1 : The following is Leigh Hunt 's answer :


`` My dear Lord , -- I need not tell you how much your second letter has gratified me , for I am apt to speak as sincerely as I think ( you must suffer me to talk in this way after what you have been kind enough to say of my independence ) , and it always rejoices me to find that those whom I wish to regard will take me at my word .
But I shall grow egotistical upon the strength of your Lordship 's good opinion .
I shall be heartily glad to see you on Saturday morning , and perhaps shall prevail upon you to take a luncheon with us at our dinner-time ( 3 ) .
The nature of your letter would have brought upon you a long answer , filled perhaps with an enthusiasm that might have made you smile  but I am keeping your servant in the cold , and so , among other good offices , you see what he has done for you .
However , I would not make a light thing of so good a matter as I mean my enthusiasm to be , and intend , before I have done , that you shall have as sound a regard for it , as I have for the feelings on your Lordship 's part that have called it forth .

Dec. 3 , 1813 .


I send you a scratch or two , the which heal .
The Christian Observer [ 1 ] is very savage , but certainly uncommonly well written -- and quite uncomfortable at the naughtiness of book and author .
I rather suspect you wo n't much like the present to be more moral , if it is to share also the usual fate of your virtuous volumes .


Let me see a proof of the six before incorporation .


[ Footnote 1 : The ` Christian Observer ' for November , 1813 ( pp. 731-737 ) felt compelled to review ` The Giaour ' , because of its extraordinary popularity  but it found that some of the passages savoured `` too much of Newgate and Bedlam for our expurgated pages . ''
It acknowledged one obligation to Byron .


`` He never attempts to deceive the world by representing the profligate as happy ... And his testimony is of the more value , as his situation in life must have permitted him to see the experiment tried under the most favourable circumstances .
He has probably seen more than one example of young men of high birth , talents , and expectancies , ... sink under the burden of unsubdued tempers , licentious alliances , and ennervating indulgence ... He has seen all this  nay , perhaps -- But we check our pen , '' etc. , etc. ]

Dec. 4 , 1813 .


Dear Sir , -- I have redde through your Persian Tales [ 1 ] , and have taken the liberty of making some remarks on the blank pages .
There are many beautiful passages , and an interesting story  and I can not give you a stronger proof that such is my opinion , than by the date of the hour -- two o'clock , -- till which it has kept me awake without a yawn .


The conclusion is not quite correct in costume : there is no Mussulman suicide on record -- at least for love .
But this matters not .
The tale must have been written by some one who has been on the spot , and I wish him , and he deserves , success .
Will you apologise to the author for the liberties I have taken with his MS. ?
Had I been less awake to , and interested in , his theme , I had been less obtrusive  but you know I always take this in good part , and I hope he will .
It is difficult to say what will succeed , and still more to pronounce what will not .
I am at this moment in that uncertainty ( on your own score )  and it is no small proof of the author 's powers to be able to charm and fix a mind 's attention on similar subjects and climates in such a predicament .
That he may have the same effect upon all his readers is very sincerely the wish , and hardly the doubt , of


Yours truly , B .


[ Footnote 1 : Henry Gally Knight ( 1786-1846 ) , who was with Byron at Trinity , Cambridge , and afterwards distinguished himself by his architectural writings ( e.g. ` The Normans in Sicily , ' 1838 ) , began his literary career with ` Ilderim , a Syrian Tale ' ( 1816 ) .
` Phrosyne , a Grecian Tale '  ` Alashtar , an Arabian Tale ' ( 1817 ) , was followed , after a considerable interval , by ` Eastern Sketches ' ( about 1829-30 ) .
If the manuscript of the first-mentioned volume is that to which Byron refers , he seems to have changed his mind as to its merits ( March 25 , 1817 ) :

Dear Sir , -- It is all very well , except that the lines are not numbered properly , and a diabolical mistake , page 67. , which must be corrected with the pen , if no other way remains  it is the omission of `` not '' before `` disagreeable '' in the note on the amber rosary .
This is really horrible , and nearly as bad as the stumble of mine at the Threshold -- I mean the misnomer of bride .
Pray do not let a copy go without the `` not  '' it is nonsense , and worse than nonsense , as it now stands .

373 .
-- To Thomas Moore .


December 8 , 1813 .


Your letter , like all the best , and even kindest things in this world , is both painful and pleasing .
But , first , to what sits nearest .
Do you know I was actually about to dedicate to you , -- not in a formal inscription , as to one 's elders , -- but through a short prefatory letter , in which I boasted myself your intimate , and held forth the prospect of your poem  when , lo !
the recollection of your strict injunctions of secrecy as to the said poem , more than once repeated by word and letter , flashed upon me , and marred my intents .
I could have no motive for repressing my own desire of alluding to you ( and not a day passes that I do not think and talk of you ) , but an idea that you might , yourself , dislike it .
You can not doubt my sincere admiration , waving personal friendship for the present , which , by the by , is not less sincere and deep rooted .
I have you by rote and by heart  of which ecce signum !
When I was at Aston , on my first visit , I have a habit , in passing my time a good deal alone , of -- I wo n't call it singing , for that I never attempt except to myself -- but of uttering , to what I think tunes , your `` Oh breathe not , '' `` When the last glimpse , '' and `` When he who adores thee , '' with others of the same minstrel  -- they are my matins and vespers .
I assuredly did not intend them to be overheard , but , one morning , in comes , not La Donna , but Il Marito , with a very grave face , saying , `` Byron , I must request you wo n't sing any more , at least of those songs . ''
I stared , and said , `` Certainly , but why ? ''
-- `` To tell you the truth , '' quoth he , `` they make my wife cry , and so melancholy , that I wish her to hear no more of them . ''


Now , my dear M. , the effect must have been from your words , and certainly not my music .
I merely mention this foolish story to show you how much I am indebted to you for even your pastimes .
A man may praise and praise , but no one recollects but that which pleases -- at least , in composition .
Though I think no one equal to you in that department , or in satire , -- and surely no one was ever so popular in both , -- I certainly am of opinion that you have not yet done all you can do , though more than enough for any one else .
I want , and the world expects , a longer work from you  and I see in you what I never saw in poet before , a strange diffidence of your own powers , which I can not account for , and which must be unaccountable , when a Cossac like me can appal a cuirassier .
Your story I did not , could not , know , -- I thought only of a Peri .
I wish you had confided in me , not for your sake , but mine , and to prevent the world from losing a much better poem than my own , but which , I yet hope , this clashing will not even now deprive them of [ 1 ] .


Mine is the work of a week , written , why I have partly told you , and partly I can not tell you by letter -- some day I will .


Go on -- I shall really be very unhappy if I at all interfere with you .
The success of mine is yet problematical  though the public will probably purchase a certain quantity , on the presumption of their own propensity for ` The Giaour ' and such `` horrid mysteries . ''
The only advantage I have is being on the spot  and that merely amounts to saving me the trouble of turning over books which I had better read again .
If your chamber was furnished in the same way , you have no need to go there to describe -- I mean only as to accuracy -- because I drew it from recollection .


This last thing of mine may have the same fate , and I assure you I have great doubts about it .
But , even if not , its little day will be over before you are ready and willing .
Come out -- `` screw your courage to the sticking-place . ''
[ 2 ]


Except the Post Bag ( and surely you can not complain of a want of success there ) , you have not been regularly out for some years .
No man stands higher , -- whatever you may think on a rainy day , in your provincial retreat .


`` Aucun homme , dans aucune langue , n ' a ete , peut-etre , plus completement le poete du coeur et le poete des femmes .
Les critiques lui reprochent de n'avoir represente le monde ni tel qu'il est , ni tel qu'il doit etre  mais les femmes repondent qu'il l' a represente tel qu'elles le desirent . ''


I should have thought Sismondi [ 3 ] had written this for you instead of Metastasio .


Write to me , and tell me of yourself .
Do you remember what Rousseau said to some one -- `` Have we quarrelled ?
you have talked to me often , and never once mentioned yourself . ''


P.S. -- The last sentence is an indirect apology for my egotism , -- but I believe in letters it is allowed .
I wish it was mutual .
I have met with an odd reflection in Grimm  it shall not -- at least the bad part -- be applied to you or me , though one of us has certainly an indifferent name -- but this it is : -- `` Many people have the reputation of being wicked , with whom we should be too happy to pass our lives '' .
I need not add it is a woman 's saying -- a Mademoiselle de Sommery 's [ 4 ] .


[ Footnote 1 :


`` Among the stories intended to be introduced into ` Lalla Rookh ' , which I had begun , but , from various causes , never finished , there was one which I had made some progress in , at the time of the appearance of ` The Bride ' , and which , on reading that poem , I found to contain such singular coincidences with it , not only in locality and costume , but in plot and characters , that I immediately gave up my story altogether , and began another on an entirely new subject -- the Fire-worshippers .
To this circumstance , which I immediately communicated to him , Lord Byron alludes in this letter .
In my hero ( to whom I had even given the name of ` Zelim , ' and who was a descendant of Ali , outlawed , with all his followers , by the reigning Caliph ) it was my intention to shadow out , as I did afterwards in another form , the national cause of Ireland .
To quote the words of my letter to Lord Byron on the subject : ' I chose this story because one writes best about what one feels most , and I thought the parallel with Ireland would enable me to infuse some vigour into my hero 's character .
But to aim at vigour and strong feeling after ` you ' is hopeless  -- that region `` was made for Caesar . '' ' ''

-- To John Galt [ 1 ] .


Dec. 11 , 1813 .


My dear Galt , -- There was no offence -- there could be none .
I thought it by no means impossible that we might have hit on something similar , particularly as you are a dramatist , and was anxious to assure you of the truth , viz. , that I had not wittingly seized upon plot , sentiment , or incident  and I am very glad that I have not in any respect trenched upon your subjects .
Something still more singular is , that the first part , where you have found a coincidence in some events within your observations on life , was drawn from observations of mine also , and I meant to have gone on with the story , but on second thoughts , I thought myself two centuries at least too late for the subject  which , though admitting of very powerful feeling and description , yet is not adapted for this age , at least this country , though the finest works of the Greeks , one of Schiller 's and Alfieri 's in modern times , besides several of our old ( and best ) dramatists , have been grounded on incidents of a similar cast .
I therefore altered it as you perceive , and in so doing have weakened the whole , by interrupting the train of thought : and in composition I do not think second thoughts are the best , though second expressions may improve the first ideas .


I do not know how other men feel towards those they have met abroad , but to me there seems a kind of tie established between all who have met together in a foreign country , as if we had met in a state of pre-existence , and were talking over a life that has ceased : but I always look forward to renewing my travels  and though you , I think , are now stationary , if I can at all forward your pursuits there as well as here , I shall be truly glad in the opportunity .


Ever yours very sincerely , B .


P.S. -- I leave town for a day or two on Monday , but after that I am always at home , and happy to see you till half-past two .


[ Footnote 1 : For John Galt , see ` Letters ' , vol .
i. p. 243 [ Footnote 1 of Letter 130 ] , and vol .
ii .
p. 101 , ` note ' 1 [ Footnote 1 of Letter 255 ] .
Galt wrote to Byron in 1813 , pointing out that `` there was a remarkable coincidence in the story '' ( of ` The Bride of Abydos ' ) `` with a matter in which I had been interested '' ( ` Life of Byron ' , p. 180 , ed .
1830 ) .
Byron , imagining himself charged with plagiarism , wrote a somewhat angry reply , to which Gait answered by stating that the coincidence was not one of ideas , sentiment , or story , but of real fact .
He received the above answer ( ` Life of Byron ' , pp. 181 , 182 ) .


On this poem Byron seems to have been particularly sensitive .
He is accused of borrowing the opening lines from Mignon 's song in Goethe 's ` Wilhelm Meister ' :


`` Kennst du das Land wo die Citronen bluehn ? ''


Cyrus Redding ( ` Yesterday and To-day ' , vol .
ii .
pp. 14 , 15 ) suggests that Byron used the translation of the poem which he himself had made and published in 1812 or 1813 .


Byron was also charged with pilfering them from Madame de Stael .


`` Do you know de Stael 's lines ? ''
he asked Lady Blessington ( ` Conversations ' , pp. 326 , 327 )  `` for if I am a thief , she must be the plundered , as I do n't read German and do French : yet I could almost swear that I never saw her verses when I wrote mine , nor do I even now remember them .
I think the first began with ` Cette terre , ' etc. , etc.  but the rest I forget .
As you have a good memory , perhaps you would repeat them . ''


`` I did so , '' says Lady Blessington , `` and they are as follows :


'' ` Cette terre , ou les myrtes fleurissent , Ou les rayons des cieux tombent avec amour , Ou des sons enchanteurs dans les airs retentissent , Ou la plus douce nuit succede au plus beau jour , ' etc. '' ]

On my return , I will answer your letter more at length .


Whatever may be your situation , I can not but commend your resolution to abjure and abandon the publication and composition of works such as those to which you have alluded .
Depend upon it they amuse few , disgrace both reader and writer , and benefit none .
It will be my wish to assist you , as far as my limited means will admit , to break such a bondage .
In your answer , inform me what sum you think would enable you to extricate yourself from the hands of your employers , and to regain , at least , temporary independence , and I shall be glad to contribute my mite towards it .
At present , I must conclude .
Your name is not unknown to me , and I regret , for your own sake , that you have ever lent it to the works you mention .
In saying this , I merely repeat your own words in your letter to me , and have no wish whatever to say a single syllable that may appear to insult your misfortunes .
If I have , excuse me  it is unintentional .

His ` Memoirs ' ( 1815 ) describe his literary undertakings , one at least of which was of a blackmailing kind , and are interspersed with protestations of his desire for independence , and of regrets for the wretched stuff that dropped from his pen .


His first novel , ` The Spirit of `` The Book , '' ' gained some success from its subject .
In 1806-7 Lady Douglas brought certain charges against the Princess of Wales , which were answered on her behalf by Spencer Perceval .
The extraordinary secrecy with which this defence , called `` The Book , '' was printed , and its complete suppression , excited curiosity , which was increased by the following advertisement in the ` Times ' for March 27 , 1809 :


'' ' A Book ' -- Any Person having in their possession a COPY of a CERTAIN BOOK , printed by Mr. Edwards , in 1807 , but ` never published ' , with W. Lindsell 's Name as the Seller of the same on the title page , and will bring it to W. Lindsell , Bookseller , Wimpole-Street , will receive a handsome gratuity . ''


The subject-matter of this book , then unknown to the public , Ashe professes to embody in ` The Spirit of `` The Book  '' or , Memoirs of Caroline , Princess of Hasburgh , a Political and Amatory Romance ' ( 3 vols. , 1811 ) .
The letters , which purport to be written from Caroline to Charlotte , and contain ( vol .
ii .
pp. 152-181 ) an attack on the Lady Jersey , who attended the princess , are absolutely dull , and scarcely even indecent .


Ashe 's ` Memoirs and Confessions ' ( 3 vols. , 1815 ) are dedicated to the Duke of Northumberland and to Byron , to whom , in a preface written at Havre , he acknowledges his `` transcendent obligations . '' ]

-- To Professor Clarke [ 1 ] .


Dec. 15 , 1813 .


Your very kind letter is the more agreeable , because , setting aside talents , judgment , and the laudari a laudato , etc. , you have been on the spot  you have seen and described more of the East than any of your predecessors -- I need not say how ably and successfully  and ( excuse the bathos ) you are one of the very few men who can pronounce how far my costume ( to use an affected but expressive word ) is correct .
As to poesy , that is , as `` men , gods , and columns , '' please to decide upon it  but I am sure that I am anxious to have an observer 's , particularly a famous observer 's , testimony on the fidelity of my manners and dresses  and , as far as memory and an oriental twist in my imagination have permitted , it has been my endeavour to present to the Franks , a sketch of that of which you have and will present them a complete picture .
It was with this notion , that I felt compelled to make my hero and heroine relatives , as you well know that none else could there obtain that degree of intercourse leading to genuine affection  I had nearly made them rather too much akin to each other  and though the wild passions of the East , and some great examples in Alfieri , Ford , and Schiller ( to stop short of antiquity ) , might have pleaded in favour of a copyist , yet the time and the north ( not Frederic , but our climate ) induced me to alter their consanguinity and confine them to cousinship .
I also wished to try my hand on a female character in Zuleika , and have endeavoured , as far as the grossness of our masculine ideas will allow , to preserve her purity without impairing the ardour of her attachment .


As to criticism , I have been reviewed about a hundred and fifty times -- praised and abused .
I will not say that I am become indifferent to either eulogy or condemnation , but for some years at least I have felt grateful for the former , and have never attempted to answer the latter .
For success equal to the first efforts , I had and have no hope  the novelty was over , and the `` Bride , '' like all other brides , must suffer or rejoice for and with her husband .
By the bye , I have used `` bride '' Turkishly , as affianced , not married  and so far it is an English bull , which , I trust , will be at least a comfort to all Hibernians not bigotted to monopoly .
You are good enough to mention your quotations in your third volume .
I shall not only be indebted to it for a renewal of the high gratification received from the two first , but for preserving my relics embalmed in your own spices , and ensuring me readers to whom I could not otherwise have aspired .


I called on you , as bounden by duty and inclination , when last in your neighbourhood  but I shall always take my chance  you surely would not have me inflict upon you a formal annunciation  I am proud of your friendship , but not so fond of myself as to break in upon your better avocations .
I trust that Mrs. Clarke is well  I have never had the honour of presentation , but I have heard so much of her in many quarters , that any notice she is pleased to take of my productions is not less gratifying than my thanks are sincere , both to her and you  by all accounts I may safely congratulate you on the possession of `` a bride '' whose mental and personal accomplishments are more than poetical .


P. S. -- Murray has sent , or will send , a double copy of the Bride and Giaour  in the last one , some lengthy additions  pray accept them , according to old custom , `` from the author '' to one of his better brethren .
Your Persian , or any memorial , will be a most agreeable , and it is my fault if not an useful present .
I trust your third will be out before I sail next month  can I say or do anything for you in the Levant ?
I am now in all the agonies of equipment , and full of schemes , some impracticable , and most of them improbable  but I mean to fly `` freely to the green earth 's end , '' [ 2 ] though not quite so fast as Miltons sprite .


P. S. 2nd .
-- I have so many things to say .
-- I want to show you Lord Sligo 's letter to me detailing , as he heard them on the spot , the Athenian account of our adventure ( a personal one ) , which certainly first suggested to me the story of The Giaour .
It was a strange and not a very long story , and his report of the reports ( he arrived just after my departure , and I did not know till last summer that he knew anything of the matter ) is not very far from the truth .
Do n't be alarmed .
There was nothing that led further than to the water 's edge  but one part ( as is often the case in life ) was more singular than any of the Giaour 's adventures .
I never have , and never should have , alluded to it on my own authority , from respect to the ancient proverb on Travellers .


[ Footnote 1 : Dr. Clark , in October , 1814 , was a candidate for the Professorship of Anatomy , and Byron went to Cambridge to vote for his friend .
Writing to Miss Tayler , Hodgson ( ` Memoir ' , vol .
i. p. 292 ) adds a postscript :


`` I open my letter to say that when Lord Byron went to give his vote just now in the Senate House , the young men burst out into the most rapturous applause . ''


The next day he writes again :


`` I should add that as I was going to vote I met him coming away , and presently saw that something had happened , by his extreme paleness and agitation .
Dr. Clark , who was with him , told me the cause , and I returned with B. to my room .
There I begged him to sit down and write a letter and communicate this event , which he did not feel up to , but wished ` I ' would .
So down I sate , and commenced my acquaintance with Miss Milbanke by writing her an account of this most pleasing event , which , although nothing at Oxford , is here very unusual indeed . ''


The following was Miss Milbanke 's answer ( ` ibid ' .
, pp. 296 , 297 ) , dated , `` Seaham , November 25 , 1814 : ''


`` Dear Sir , -- It will be easier for you to imagine than for me to express the pleasure which your very kind letter has given me .
Not only on account of its gratifying intelligence , but also as introductory to an acquaintance which I have been taught to value , and have sincerely desired .
Allow me to consider Lord Byron 's friend as not ' a stranger , ' and accept , with my sincerest thanks , my best wishes for your own happiness .


`` I am , dear sir , your faithful servant ,


`` A. I. MlLBANKE . '' ]


[ Footnote 2 : The Spirit in Miltons ` Comus , a Mask ' ( lines 1012 , 1013 ) , says :


`` I can fly , or I can run Quickly to the green earths end . '' ]

-- To Leigh Hunt .


Dec. 22 , 1813 .


My Dear Sir , -- I am indeed `` in your debt , '' -- and , what is still worse , am obliged to follow royal example ( he has just apprised his creditors that they must wait till the next meeting ) , and intreat your indulgence for , I hope , a very short time .
The nearest relation and almost the only friend I possess , has been in London for a week , and leaves it tomorrow with me for her own residence .
I return immediately  but we meet so seldom , and are so minuted when we meet at all , that I give up all engagements till now , without reluctance .
On my return , I must see you to console myself for my past disappointment .
I should feel highly honoured in Mr. B. 's permission to make his acquaintance , and there you are in my debt  for it is a promise of last summer which I still hope to see performed .
Yesterday I had a letter from Moore  you have probably heard from him lately  but if not , you will be glad to learn that he is the same in heart , head , and health .

-- To John Murray .


December 27 , 1813 .


Lord Holland is laid up with the gout , and would feel very much obliged if you could obtain , and send as soon as possible , Madame D'Arblay 's ( or even Miss Edgeworth 's ) new work .
I know they are not out  but it is perhaps possible for your Majesty to command what we can not with much suing purchase , as yet .
I need not say that when you are able or willing to confer the same favour on me , I shall be obliged .
I would almost fall sick myself to get at Madame D'Arblay 's writings .


P.S. -- You were talking to-day of the American E'n of a certain unquenchable memorial of my younger days [ 1 ] .
As it ca n't be helped now , I own I have some curiosity to see a copy of transatlantic typography .
This you will perhaps obtain , and one for yourself  but I must beg that you will not import more , because , seriously , I do wish to have that thing forgotten as much as it has been forgiven .


If you send to the ` Globe ' E ` r , say that I want neither excuse nor contradiction , but merely a discontinuance of a most ill-grounded charge .
I never was consistent in any thing but my politics  and as my redemption depends on that solitary virtue , it is murder to carry away my last anchor .
