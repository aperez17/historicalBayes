Dolly Reforming Herself


ACT I .


Scene : Drawing-room at Harry Telfer 's , The Gables , Crookbury Green , Surrey .
A well-furnished room in a modern red brick country house .
At the back , a little to the right , is a door leading into the hall .
All along the right side is a glass partition , showing a conservatory which is entered by glass doors , one up stage , the other down .
On the left side is a large fireplace .
At the back , in the centre , is a handsome writing-desk with a shut down flap lid .
Above the fireplace , facing the audience is a large sofa .
To the right of sofa , and below it in the left centre of the room is a small table , and near to it an easy chair .
Right centre down stage is a larger table .


Time : The afternoon of 1st January , 1907 .


Discover at writing-table , back to audience , Dolly Telfer , a bright little woman about thirty , busied with bills and papers .
Bending over her , back to audience , is her father , Matt Barron , a pleasant-looking , easy-going cynic of sixty .
Harry Telfer , Dolly 's husband , an ordinary good-natured , weakish , impulsive Englishman about thirty-five , is standing with his back to the fire .
Sitting on sofa , reading a scientific book , is Professor [ 10 ] Sturgess , a hard , dry , narrow , fattish scientific man about forty-five .
At the table , right , reading a French novel , is Renie Sturgess , the Professor 's wife , a tall , dark , handsome woman about thirty .


Harry .
No , I ca n't say that I pay very much attention to sermons as a rule , but Pilcher gave us a regular downright , no-mistake-about-it , rouser at the Watch-night Service last night .


Matt .
[ Turning round . ]
I wonder what precise difference this rousing sermon will make in the conduct of any person who heard it .


Harry .
Well , it 's going to make a lot of difference in my conduct .
At least , I wo n't say a lot of difference , because I do n't call myself a very bad sort of fellow , do you ?


Matt .
N-o - No - -


Harry .
At any rate I 'm a thundering good husband , ai n't I , Dolly ?
[ Dolly takes no notice . ]
And I 've got no flagrant vices .
But I 've got a heap of - well a heap of selfish little habits , such as temper , and so on , and for the coming year I 'm going to knock them all off .


Matt .
That will be a score for Pilcher - that is , if you do knock them off .


Harry .
Oh , I 'm thoroughly resolved !
I promised Dolly last night , did n't I , Dolly ?
[ Dolly takes no notice . ]
Dolly too !
Dolly was awfully impressed by the sermon , were n't you , Dolly ?


Matt .
[ Looking round at Dolly 's back . ]
Dolly was awfully impressed ?


Harry .
Yes .
Before we went to bed she gave me her word , that if I 'd give her a little help , she 'd pay off all her bills , and live within her allowance for the future , did n't you , Dolly ?


Matt .
Well , that will be another score for Pilcher - that is , if Dolly does live within her allowance .
[ 11 ]


Harry .
Oh , Dolly means it this time , do n't you Dolly ?


Dolly .
[ Turns round on her stool , bills in hand . ]
I think it 's disgraceful !


Matt .
What ?


Dolly .
These tradespeople !
[ Comes down to Matt . ]
I 'm almost sure I 've paid this bill once - if not twice .
Then there 's a mistake of thirty shillings in the addition - you 're good at figures , Dad .
Do add that up for me .
My head is so muddled .


[ Giving the bill to Matt .


Harry .
Are n't you glad , Doll , that you made that resolution not to have any more bills ?


Dolly .
It will be heavenly !
To go about all day with the blessed thought that I do n't owe a farthing to anybody .
It 's awful !


[ Crunching a bill in her hand , and throwing it on to writing-table .


Harry .
Cheer up , little woman !
You do n't owe such a very alarming amount , do you ?


Dolly .
Oh no !
Oh no !
And if you 'll only help me as you promised - -


Harry .
We 'll go thoroughly into it by-and-by .
In fact I did mean to give you a pleasant little Christmas surprise , and pay off all your debts .


Dolly .
Oh , you angel !
But why did n't you do it ?


Harry .
I 've done it so often !
You remember the last time ?


Dolly .
[ Making a wry face . ]
Yes , I remember the last time .


Harry .
And here we are again !


Dolly .
Oh , do n't talk like a clown !


Harry .
But , my dear Dolly , here we are again .


Dolly .
Well , I have n't got the money sense !
I simply have n't got it !
I was born without it !
[ 12 ]


Matt .
[ Hands her the bill . ]
The addition is quite correct .


Dolly .
[ Taking the bill . ]
You 're sure ?
Then I 'm convinced I 've paid it !
[ Looking at bill . ]
Yes !
Thirty-four , seven , six .
Professor Sturgess - -


Prof. [ Looks up from his book ] Yes ?


Dolly .
You understand all about psychology and the way our brains work .


Prof. I 've given my entire life to their study , but I can not claim that I understand them .


Dolly .
But would n't you say - -


Prof. What ?


Dolly .
I 'm morally certain I 've paid this bill .


Matt .
Have you got the receipt ?


Dolly .
No !
I must have mislaid it .


Matt .
When , and where did you pay it ?


Dolly .
I can not recall the exact circumstances .
And now - -


Matt .
And now - - ?


Dolly .
Fulks and Garner have sent me a most impertinent note requesting immediate payment .


Prof. What is the particular brain process that you wish me to explain ?


Dolly .
How do you account for my having the most vivid impression that I 've paid it - so vivid that I can not shake it off ?


Prof. Well - a - -


Matt .
Is n't it an instance of that obscure operation of the feminine mind whereby the merest wish becomes an accomplished fact ?


Dolly .
My dear Dad , I actually remember the exact amount : thirty-four , seven , six .
Thirty-four , seven , six .
I shall never enter Fulks and Garnet 's shop again !


Enter Criddle .
[ Announces . ]
Captain Wentworth !
[ 13 ]


Enter Captain Lucas Wentworth , a good-looking smart young army man about thirty .
He is in riding-clothes .
Exit Criddle .
At Captain Wentworth 's entrance Renie shows keen interest , throws him a secret glance as he goes to shake hands with Dolly .
Dolly .
Ah , Lu !
What , over again !
Happy New Year once more !


Lucas .
Same to you .
[ Shaking hands . ]
Happy New Year , everybody !
Good afternoon , Harry !


[ Nodding to Harry .


Harry .
Ditto , Lu .


Lucas .
Ah , Uncle Matt !
Happy New Year !


[ Shaking hands .


Matt .
Happy New Year , Lucas !


Lucas .
Good afternoon , Mrs. Sturgess .


[ Shaking hands with Renie .


Renie .
Good afternoon .


Lucas .
None the worse for your outing last night , I hope ?


Renie .
Oh no , I 'm sure Mr. Pilcher 's sermon ought to make us all very much better .


Dolly .
May I introduce you to Professor Sturgess - my cousin Captain Wentworth .


Lucas .
How d' ye do ?


Prof. How d' ye do ?


Matt .
So you came over to the Watch-night Service , I hear ?


Lucas .
Yes !
I 'd nothing much better to do , and Dolly was cracking up this new parson of yours , so I thought I 'd jog over and sample him .


Matt .
A dozen miles over here at midnight  an hour 's service in a cold church  and a dozen miles back to Aldershot , in the sleet and snow .
I hope the sermon thoroughly braced you up !
[ 14 ]


Lucas .
It did .
It made me feel just as good as I knew how to be .


Matt .
Here 's another score for Pilcher !


Dolly .
Dad , I think it 's shocking bad taste of you to keep on sneering at Mr. Pilcher !


Matt .
I 'm not sneering .
I 'm only curious to follow up this wonderful sermon , and trace its results on all of you .


Dolly .
Well , you can see its results .
[ Lucas has got near to Renie , stands with his back to her , takes out a letter from his coat-tail pocket , holds it out for her to take .
She takes it , pops it in her novel , and goes on reading .
He moves away from her . ]
Take only our own family .
Harry and I both have turned over a new leaf .
Renie , you said Mr. Pilcher had set you thinking deeply - -


Renie .
Yes , dear , very deeply .


Dolly .
Lu , you said the sermon had done you a lot of good .


Lucas .
Heaps !
I wo n't say I 'm going to set up for a saint straight off , because - well - I 'm not so sure I could bring it off , even if I tried - -


Matt .
That 's what holds me back , my wretched nervous fear that I should n't bring it off .
Still , in justice to Pilcher , I hope you 're not going to let his sermon be wasted .


Lucas .
Oh , no !
My first spare five minutes I 'm going to brisk about , and do a bit of New Year 's tidying up .


[ He is standing over Renie , who has opened his letter in her novel  he again exchanges a secret look of understanding with her , and makes a sign to her to go into the conservatory .


Enter Criddle .


Criddle .
[ Announcing . ]
Mr. Pilcher !
[ 15 ]


Enter the Reverend James Pilcher , a big , strong , bright , genial , manly , hearty English parson about forty .
Exit Criddle .
Dolly .
How d' ye do ?
[ Shaking hands .


Pilcher .
How d' ye do ?
Happy New Year , once more !
Happy New Year , Mr. Barron !


Matt .
[ Shaking hands . ]
A happy New Year .


Pilcher .
How do again , Telfer ?


Harry .
How are you ?


Pilcher .
Good morning , Mrs. Sturgess .


Renie .
Good morning .


[ At Pilcher 's entrance she has hidden her French novel behind her in the chair .
In shaking hands with Pilcher it drops on to the floor and Lucas 's letter drops out .
Lucas goes to pick it up , Mr. Pilcher is before him , picks up the novel and letter and hands them to Renie .
In taking them she shows some confusion .


Pilcher .
[ Genially . ]
Improving the New Year by getting a thorough knowledge of Parisian life and manners , I see .


Renie .
[ Confused . ]
No !
- I had begun the book a week ago and so I thought - a - I 'd better finish it .


Lucas .
Good morning , Mr. Pilcher .


Pilcher .
[ Shaking hands . ]
Good morning .


Lucas .
Rattling good sermon you gave us last night .


Pilcher .
I 'm glad you thought it worth coming so far to hear .


Lucas .
Not at all .
Jolly well worth coming for , eh , Mrs. Sturgess ?


[ With a sly little look and shake of the head at Renie .


Renie .
I thoroughly enjoyed it !
[ 16 ]


Pilcher .
[ A little surprised . ]
Enjoyed it !
Now I meant to make you all very uncomfortable !


Dolly .
Oh , you gave us a good shaking up , and we deserved it !
I do n't think you 've met Professor Sturgess ?


Pilcher .
[ Advancing to Professor . ]
No , but I 've read his book , `` Man , the Automaton . ''


Prof. [ Bowing . ]
Not with disapproval , I trust ?


Pilcher .
[ Shaking hands very cordially . ]
With the most profound disapproval , with boundless , uncompromising dissent and antagonism !


Prof. I 'm sorry !


Pilcher .
Why , you deny that man has any vestige of free will .


Prof. Certainly .
The longer I live , the more I 'm convinced that free will is a purely subjective illusion .


Dolly .
Do you mean that when I will to do a certain thing I ca n't do it ?
Oh , that 's absurd .
For instance , I will to go and touch that chair !
[ She goes and touches it . ]
There !
[ Triumphantly . ]
I 've done it !
That shows I 've got free will .
[ The Professor shakes his head . ]
Well , then how did I do it ?


Prof. I affirm that your willing to touch that chair or not to touch it , your actual touching it , or not touching it  your possession or non-possession of a criminal impulse - -


Dolly .
I have n't any criminal impulses - -


Prof. [ Shakes his head and goes on . ]
Your yielding to that criminal impulse or your not yielding to it - all these states of consciousness are entirely dependent upon the condition , quantity and arrangement of certain atoms in the gray matter of your brain .
You think , you will , you act according as that gray matter works .
You did not cause or make that condition of the atoms of your gray matter , therefore you are not responsible for thinking or acting in this [ 17 ] way or that , seeing that your thoughts , and your actions , and that direction of your impulses which you call your will , are all precisely determined and regulated by the condition and arrangement of these minute atoms of your gray matter !


Dolly .
[ Has at first listened with great attention , but has grown bewildered as the Professor goes on . ]
I do n't care anything about my gray matter !
I 've quite made up my mind I wo n't have any more bills !


Pilcher .
[ Turning to Renie . ]
Does Mrs. Sturgess agree with the Professor 's doctrine ?


Renie .
No , indeed !
To say that we 're mere machines - it 's horrid .


Prof. The question is not whether it 's horrid , but whether it 's true .


Pilcher .
What do you think , Mr. Barron ?


Matt .
It 's a very nutty and knotty problem .
I 'm watching to see Dolly and Harry solve it !


Dolly .
See us solve it !
How ?


Matt .
You and Harry heard a most thrilling , soul-stirring sermon last night .


Pilcher .
You had good hearsay accounts of my sermon ?


Matt .
Excellent !
I should have heard it myself , but I 've reached an age when it would be dangerous to give up any of my old and cherished bad habits .
So in place of going to church and selfishly reforming myself , I shall have to be content with watching Dolly and Harry reform themselves .


Dolly .
Do n't take any notice of him , Mr. Pilcher , he 's the most cynical , hardened reprobate !
I have to blush for him a hundred times a day .


[ Renie strolls casually into conservatory by lower door .
Lucas casually follows her .


Matt .
And in order to settle once and for all this vexed question of free will and moral responsibility , [ 18 ] I 'll bet you , Harry , a simple fiver , and I 'll bet you Dolly , a new Parisian hat , and half a dozen pairs of gloves that you wo n't live up to your good resolutions , and that on next New Year 's Day you 'll neither of you be one ha ` penny the better for all the wise counsels Mr. Pilcher gave you last night .


Harry .
A fiver !
Done !


Dolly .
I 'll take you , too !
In fact , I 'll double it  two new Parisian hats , and a dozen pairs of gloves !


Matt .
Done , my dear !


Pilcher .
I hope I sha 'n' t be accused of talking shop if I venture to recall that betting was one of the bad habits I especially warned my congregation against , last night !


Harry .
By Jove , yes - I 'd forgotten all about that !
Of course , if you wish us to cry off - -


Pilcher .
Well , not exactly .
I might perhaps suggest an alternative plan which was tried with great success in my late parish - -


Dolly .
What was that ?


Pilcher .
A very capital good fellow - an auctioneer and land surveyor , my churchwarden in fact , by name Jobling - found that in spite of constant good resolutions , certain small vices were gradually creeping upon him .
There was an occasional outburst of temper to his clerks , an occasional half glass too much  and on one lamentable market day , he actually discovered himself using bad language to Mrs. Jobling - -


Dolly .
[ Looking at Harry . ]
Oh !
Ah !


Matt .
Jobling 's gray matter ca n't have been in good working order .


Pilcher .
We corrected that !
We got his gray matter under control .


Dolly .
How ?


Pilcher .
My Christmas Blanket Club happened to be on the road to bankruptcy .
By the way , our [ 19 ] Blanket Club here is in low water .
Well , I gave Jobling a small box with a hole at the top sufficiently large to admit half a crown .
And I suggested that whenever he was betrayed into one of these little slips , he should fine himself for the benefit of my Blanket Club - -


Harry .
Good business !
Dolly , where 's that collecting-box they sent us from the Hospital for Incurables ?


Dolly .
In the cupboard in the next room .


Harry .
Right-o !
No time like the present !
[ Exit . ]


Matt .
And how did you get out of this dilemma ?


Pilcher .
Dilemma ?


Matt .
Did your Blanket Club remain in bankruptcy , or what must have been an even more distressing alternative to you , did Jobling continue to use bad language to his wife ?


Pilcher .
We struck a happy medium .
My Blanket Club balance was considerably augmented , and Jobling 's behaviour considerably improved under the stress of the fines .


Re-enter Harry with an old , dusty collecting-box on which is printed in large letters , `` County Hospital for Incurables . ''
Harry .
[ Placing the box on the table . ]
There !
My name 's Jobling for the present !
By Jove !
that was a very neat idea of yours .


Pilcher .
Ah , by the way , I did n't give you Jobling 's tariff - -


Harry .
Tariff ?


Pilcher .
Jobling 's tariff for a mild little profanity like `` By Jove , '' was a mere sixpence .


Harry .
Oh !
[ Feels in his pocket .


Pilcher .
Of course you need n't adopt Jobling 's scale .


[ 20 ]


Harry .
Oh yes !
I 'll toe the mark !
[ Takes six pence out of his pocket and puts it in his box . ]
I 'm determined I 'll cure myself of all these bad little tricks - -


Matt .
[ To Dolly , pointing to the money-box . ]
Are you going to contribute ?


Dolly .
[ Snappishly . ]
Perhaps , when I 've paid off my bills .


Matt .
[ To Pilcher . ]
Will you kindly let my daughter have your lowest tariff for ladies ?


Dolly .
Oh , please do n't be in such a hurry .
What about your own contribution ?
Mr. Pilcher , I hope you do n't intend to let my father escape .


Pilcher .
I understood Mr. Barron was prepared to risk a five-pound note that you and Mr. Telfer will not carry your New Year resolutions into practice ?


Matt .
With the almost certain chance of drawing a five-pound note from Harry and a new hat from Dolly .


Pilcher .
I 'm afraid I ca n't hold out those inducements .
But I can offer you the very pleasing alternatives of chuckling over your daughter 's and Mr. Telfer 's lapses , or of contributing five pounds to an excellent charity !


Matt .
H 'm !
Well I 'll do my best to oblige you , Mr. Pilcher !
Let me see !


[ Looking round , his eye falls on Renie and Lucas who , at the beginning of the above conversation have gone into conservatory at lower door , and now come out again at upper door .
She has a hot-house flower in her hand , and they are eagerly absorbed in their conversation .
The Professor talking to Harry and not noticing .


Renie .
[ Becoming aware that Matt is watching them . ]
Yes , that arrangement of the stamens is quite unusual .
It 's what the gardener calls a `` sport '' - [ 21 ] -


Lucas .
[ Examining the flower . ]
Jolly good sport , too !


Matt .
I 'm not sure that we have n't even better sport here - -


Renie .
[ Coming to him . ]
Sport ?
What sport ?
Can we join ?


Matt .
That 's just what I was going to propose .
There are four of you here , who heard Mr. Pilcher 's excellent discourse last night .
And you are all determined to turn over a new leaf this year .
Is n't that so ?


Dolly .
Yes !


Harry .
I know I am .


Matt .
Mrs. Sturgess ?


Renie .
Yes , indeed !


Matt .
Lucas , you ?


Lucas .
Yes , Uncle .


Matt .
On the first of January next , I am prepared to put a sovereign in that money-box for every one of you who can honestly declare that he has broken himself or herself of his bad habits during the year .


Lucas .
I say , not all our bad habits ?


Matt .
H 'm .
I do n't wish to be exacting - I 've no doubt each of you has his own little failing or weakness .
Well , come to me and say on your honour that you 've conquered this or that pet special weakness - and in goes my sovereign .


Lucas .
You do n't really mean it ?


Matt .
Indeed I do .
I hope you wo n't stand out and - spoil sport , eh ?


Lucas .
Oh , I do n't mind coming in - just for the lark of the thing .


Matt .
Then you all agree ?


Dolly .
Oh yes .


Harry .
Certainly .


Matt .
Mrs. Sturgess ?
[ 22 ]


Renie .
We do n't know where we may be next Christmas .


Dolly .
You 'll be here with us .
I invite you on the spot .
You accept ?


Renie .
Yes , delighted , if my husband - -


Prof. Very pleased .


Matt .
Well , Mr. Pilcher , I think I 've made your Blanket Club a very handsome offer .


Pilcher .
Very handsome .
[ Taking out watch . ]
I hope our friends will cordially respond , for the sake of my Blanket Club .


Dolly .
You 'll stay for a cup of tea ?


Pilcher .
I 've heaps of New Year 's calls to make .
I 'm afraid I must be going  good afternoon , Professor !


Prof. Good afternoon .


Pilcher .
Good afternoon , Telfer .


Harry .
Good afternoon .


Pilcher .
Good-bye , Mrs. Sturgess .


Renie .
Good-bye .
So many thanks for your eloquent sermon .


[ Shaking hands .


Pitcher .
Now , was I eloquent ?
I suppose I was , since I 've produced such an invigorating New Year atmosphere .


[ Renie moves her French novel .


Matt .
And brought Lucas over from Aldershot in the snow !


Lucas .
Rather !
I shall come again next year .


[ Shaking hands .


Pilcher .
Do .
And then we shall be able to estimate the effect of my eloquence .


Matt .
[ Tapping the money-box . ]
We shall !


Pilcher .
Good-bye , Mrs. Telfer .


Dolly .
Good-bye .
[ Rings bell .


Pilcher .
Good-bye , Mr. Barron .


Matt .
Good-bye .
[ 23 ]


Pilcher .
You might be inclined to risk a sovereign on yourself for the Blanket Club ?


Matt .
I dare n't .
I ca n't trust my gray matter - I should make a dreadful fiasco .


[ Criddle appears at door .


Pilcher .
Mrs. Telfer , I leave him in your hands .


[ Exit Pilcher .
Criddle closes the door after him .


Matt .
Dolly , I do n't mind having that new Parisian hat on with you .


Dolly .
Done !
I do n't mind how much I punish you .


Prof. [ Taking out his watch . ]
Half past three , my dear .


Renie .
I do n't think I 'll go out this afternoon .


Prof. Oh , you 'd better take your little constitutional .
You missed it yesterday .
I 'm sure your restlessness is due to your not taking regular exercise .


Renie .
Which way are you going ?
[ Yawning .


Prof. My usual round , up to the White House and back by the fish-pond .


Renie .
Perhaps I 'll join you at the fish-pond .


Prof. [ To Matt . ]
Nothing like living by rule and measure .


Matt .
I should n't wonder .
I 've never tried it .


Prof. I ascribe my constant good health and contentment to my unvarying routine of work and diet and exercise .
[ Exit .


Matt .
Then where do my constant good health and contentment come from ?


Lucas .
Dolly , I left my evening kit here .
Could you put me up for the night ?


Dolly .
Delighted !
You 'll make up our rubber .


Lucas .
Right !


Matt .
Not going to ride back to Aldershot again to-night ?


Lucas .
Not to-night , thank you .
[ 24 ]


Matt .
Just a shade too bracing , eh ?


Lucas .
Just a shade !
Dolly , I have n't seen your new fish-pond .
Is anybody going to meet the Professor ?


[ Glancing at Renie .


Matt .
I am .
[ Linking his arm in Lucas 's . ]
We 'll get into an unvarying routine of exercise for the next hour .
Come along !


[ Takes Lucas off as he is exchanging a look with Renie .
Renie makes to follow them , stops at door , turns back a little , stops , takes out Lucas 's letter from her French novel , goes to fire and reads it .
Meanwhile the following scene takes place between Dolly and Harry .


Harry .
[ To Dolly . ]
Now , Dolly , we can go through your bills .


[ Going to her writing-desk .


Dolly .
Yes .
Had n't I better sort them out first ?


Harry .
[ Taking up bills . ]
Oh , I 'll help you sort them out - -


Dolly .
Take care !
You 'll muddle all my papers .
[ Taking bills out of his hands , and closing down the writing-desk . ]
I want to have a little talk with Renie - you 'd better join them at the fish-pond .


Harry .
Well , so long as you do get them sorted , and squared up .
What about after tea ?


Dolly .
All right .
After tea .


Harry .
After tea .
We 'll have a nice cosy half-hour , all to ourselves , and sweep them all out of our minds .


[ With a gesture .


Dolly .
[ Nods cheerfully . ]
Yes , a nice cosy half-hour and sweep them all out of our minds .
[ With his gesture .
Exit Harry briskly .
She repeats his gesture . ]
[ 25 ] Sweep them all out of our minds .
[ Opening desk and regarding bills with dismay . ]
Oh , do n't I wish I could !
Oh , Renie !


[ Renie is busy with her letter at the fire .


Renie .
[ Puts letter into pocket . ]
What is it ?


Dolly .
[ Has taken up one or two bills . ]
These bills !
These awful bills !
These vampires !


Renie .
Yes , dear !
I suppose it 's rather dreadful , but it must be sweet to have a dear , kind husband who 'll pay them all off .


Dolly .
Harry ?
He made a dreadful fuss last time .
And then I did n't show him all .


Renie .
Well , dear , after all , it 's only bills - -


Dolly .
Only bills !
Only ?
Well , I 'm going to show him every one this time .
And what a lesson it shall be to me !
That 's why I 'm so grateful to Mr. Pilcher .


Renie .
Why ?


Dolly .
Yesterday afternoon I thought I 'd screw up my courage to go through the bills just to see where I was .
My dear , I was paralysed !
I had the most appalling time !
Well , Mr. Pilcher 's sermon came just in the nick of time .
I thought `` what an idiot I must be to endure all this misery just for want of a little resolution . ''


Renie .
Mr. Pilcher 's sermon came just in the nick of time for me too .


Dolly .
Did it ?


Renie .
I had an awful afternoon yesterday !


Dolly .
You ?!
You have n't any bills ?


Renie .
No !
[ Sighs . ]
I almost wish I had .


Dolly .
Wish you had ?!


Renie .
I almost envy you the delicious experience of having to confess - -


Dolly .
Yes dear , you always were fond of scenes , but I 'm not !


Renie .
And then the heavenly feeling of being forgiven , and taken in the arms of the man you love !
[ 26 ]


Dolly .
Yes , that part of it is all right .
It 's what comes before - -


[ With a little shudder .


Renie .
After all , your husband is n't a machine .
He is a human being !


Dolly .
Oh , Harry 's a perfect dear in most things , but he has got a temper !


Renie .
My husband never even swears at me !
Oh , Dolly , you are lucky !


Dolly .
Hum !


Renie .
Oh , Dolly - - [ Sighs and goes away .


Dolly .
Is anything the matter ?


Renie .
No dear .
Nothing , except - oh , life is so hard !
so hard !


Dolly .
Renie , if you 're in trouble - -


Renie .
Thank you , dear .
I knew you 'd help me .


Dolly .
Yes , so long as it is n't money .
And even then I 'd help you , only I ca n't .


Renie .
It is n't money .


Dolly .
Then what is it ?


Renie .
[ Looking at Dolly curiously . ]
I wonder if you would understand .


Dolly .
I 'll do my best .


Renie .
It 's such a strange story .
[ Moving away , Dolly makes a little dubious grimace behind her back .
Renie suddenly comes up to Dolly very effusively . ]
Dolly , I will trust you .
You know I thoroughly admire and honour my husband .


Dolly .
[ A little startled . ]
Ye-es .


Renie .
You know that nothing could ever induce me to wrong him for a moment ?


Dolly .
No - -


Renie .
Nothing could be further from my thoughts .


Dolly .
No - but is there anybody - Renie , who is it ?


Renie .
Give me your sacred promise you 'll never breathe a word to any living soul ?
[ 27 ]


Dolly .
Not a word - who is it ?


Renie .
Not even to your husband ?


Dolly .
Not even to my husband .


Renie .
Nor to him ?


Dolly .
Him ?
No , of course not .
Who is it ?


Renie .
Well , dear , you know what my life has been .
Few women have met with so little real sympathy as I. Few women have suffered - -


Dolly .
No , dear .
Who is it ?
Do I know him ?


Renie .
Your cousin Lucas has a deep and sincere admiration for me .


Dolly .
Lu !?
Lu !?
Of course !
I might have known he 'd never ride a dozen miles in the snow for a sermon !
It 's disgraceful of him !


Renie .
No , dear , he 's not to blame .
We are neither of us to blame .


Dolly .
[ Contemptuously . ]
Oh !
Why you have n't known him a month , have you ?


Renie .
I met him for the first time in this room three weeks ago last Thursday afternoon .


Dolly .
It 's a great pity the Professor did n't come down with you .


Renie .
That would have made no difference .
It had to be !


Dolly .
What had to be ?
Renie , how far has this gone ?
You 've been meeting him alone - -


Renie .
Once or twice .


Dolly .
You 've slipped away every afternoon this week .


Renie .
However often I may have met him , he has offered me nothing but the most chivalrous attention .
He has always respected me - -


Dolly .
Well then , he must n't respect you any more .
It must be stopped .


Renie .
Dolly , I did n't expect you to take up this attitude .
[ 28 ]


Dolly .
You do n't suppose I 'm going to have this sort of thing in my own house , do you ?


Renie .
What sort of thing ?


Dolly .
Do you remember the awful row I got into at school when your boy 's love letter was discovered in the Banbury cakes you 'd persuaded me to take in for you ?


Renie .
But you received Banbury cakes of your own !


Dolly .
Not since I 've been married .
Of course before your marriage your outrageous flirting did n't much matter - -


Renie .
Outrageous flirting ?
- If I seemed to flirt - -


Dolly .
Seemed ?!


Renie .
It was only in the vain hope of meeting with one who could offer me the perfect homage that I have always felt would one day be mine .


Dolly .
Well , he must n't offer it here !
I shall tell him so very plainly .
He 'd better not stay to dinner .


Renie .
There is no reason Captain Wentworth should not stay to dinner .
He has given me the one absolutely blameless unselfish devotion of his life .
I 've accepted it on that distinct understanding .
I 've trusted you with my secret , a secret honourable alike to Captain Wentworth and myself .
You 've promised not to breathe a word to any living soul .
You surely do n't mean to break your word ?


Dolly .
I do n't mean to stand the racket of your Banbury cakes .


Renie .
I did n't expect you to be so unsympathetic .
You promised to help me !


Dolly .
Help you !
How did you expect me to help you ?


Renie .
My husband has to go to Edinburgh next week to give a course of lectures there .
[ 29 ]


Dolly .
Well ?


Renie .
He wants me to go with him .
Dearest , it would be perfectly sweet of you to ask me to stay on another fortnight here .


Dolly .
[ Makes a little movement of indignant surprise . ]
I see !


Renie .
There could be no possible harm in it now that you know our attachment is quite innocent and that you can look after me every moment .
Dearest , you might oblige me in a tiny little matter like this .


Dolly .
[ After a pause . ]
I 'll think it over - -


Renie .
Thank you so much .


Dolly .
Renie , you said Mr. Pilcher 's sermon came just in the nick of time - -


Renie .
So it did .


Dolly .
You do n't call this the `` nick of time '' ?!


Renie .
Yes , indeed .
I went to church in a perfect fever .
I did n't know what to do .
Well , as I listened to Mr. Pilcher everything became quite clear to me .
I resolved I would accept Captain Wentworth 's pure unselfish devotion and make it a lever to raise all my ideals and aspirations !


Dolly .
But there was n't anything in Mr. Pilcher 's sermon about - -


Renie .
Oh yes , there was a lot about ideals and aspirations .


Dolly .
Yes , but not the sort of aspirations you have for Lucas .
I suppose you know he makes love to every woman he comes across ?


Renie .
He told me he had been led into one or two unworthy attachments .


Dolly .
Yes !
That 's quite right .
So he has !
One or two !


Renie .
That was before he met me .


Dolly .
Yes , and this will be before he meets the next lady .
[ 30 ]


Renie .
[ Looks at Dolly severely . ]
My dear Dolly , with your light frivolous nature it is impossible for you to understand a pure and exalted attachment like ours .
Listen !
[ Taking out a letter . ]
This will show you his fine nature , his fine feelings - `` From the first moment I saw you - - ''


Matt enters .
Renie .
[ Putting letter in pocket . ]
Well , have you had a pleasant walk ?


Matt .
Very pleasant - and instructive .
The Professor asked me to remind you that he 's waiting for you at the fish-pond .


Renie .
I 'd better go .
I shall get a little lecture all to myself if I do n't .
[ Going off , to Dolly . ]
Thank you , dear , so much for your kind invitation to stay on !


Dolly .
Do n't mention it !


Renie .
I shall try to manage it .
[ Exit .


Dolly .
Yes , I 'm sure you will .


Matt .
Mrs. Sturgess going to stay on ?


Dolly .
She wants me to invite her .
But I wo n't if I can help it .
[ Goes to him suddenly . ]
Dad !


Matt .
Well ?


Dolly .
That wretched Lucas !


Matt .
What about him ?


Dolly .
No , I 've promised her not to breathe a word .
So you must guess .
[ Pause . ]
Have you guessed ?


Matt .
[ After a pause . ]
Yes .
Well , I - [ Begins to chuckle . ]
So Lucas is up to his old games !


Dolly .
My own guest !
Under my own roof !
It 's too horrid of him .


Matt .
[ Chuckling . ]
It is !
It 's too bad !
The rascal .


Dolly .
Oh , it 's more than half her fault !
It 's just like her !


[ Matt suddenly bursts from a chuckle into a roar .


[ 31 ]


Dolly .
What are you laughing at ?


Matt .
I 've just left - - [ Chuckling . ]
I 've just left the Professor down at the fish-pond explaining to Lucas all about his gray matter , and - - [ Roars .


Dolly .
I do n't see anything to laugh at .


Matt .
Twelve miles in the snow - - I say , Doll , we 're making a splendid start for the New Year !
[ Laughing .


Dolly .
Dad !
Will you please leave off ?
[ Shaking his shoulder . ]
Will you be serious ?


Matt .
Yes , my dear !!
[ Pulling himself together and straightening his features . ]
Yes , I will .
After all , it 's a serious matter .


Dolly .
It 's very serious for me , in a neighbourhood like this !


Matt .
It 's serious for me , as I was Lucas 's guardian .
And it 's serious for him .
If he goes and plays the fool , it may spoil his career - the young ass !


Dolly .
Very well , then , will you please treat it seriously and set to work and help me ?


Matt .
How far have matters gone ?


Dolly .
Oh , there 's no real harm done at present .


Matt .
How do you know ?


Dolly .
Oh , Lucas is writing her silly letters and she 's talking about his pure and exalted devotion , and making it a lever to raise all her ideals and aspirations .


Matt .
[ Shakes his head . ]
That looks bad !
That looks very dangerous for her .


Dolly .
Oh , no  she knows how to take care of herself .
But it 's dangerous for me !


Matt .
How , dangerous for you ?!


Dolly .
If there 's the least bit of scandal she 'll contrive to drag me into it !
I know her so well .


Matt .
[ Walking about , cogitating . ]
Yes , and we must n't let Lucas make a mess of it .


Dolly .
What can we do ?
[ 32 ]


Matt .
When I was over at Aldershot last week Sir John said something about giving Lucas an A. D. C. in India .
I 'll drive over to-morrow and ask Sir John to pack Lucas out of the country for a year or two !


Dolly .
That 's a good idea .
But it may take some time ?


Matt .
A week or so , perhaps more .


Dolly .
But if they find out they 're going to be parted , it is just this next week when there will be all the danger .


Matt .
That 's true .


Dolly .
They ought to be parted to-night .


Matt .
They ought !
They ought !
Not a doubt about it !
Not a shadow of doubt !
They ought to be parted to-night !


Dolly .
Dad !
I believe I can frighten Renie out of it .


Matt .
Frighten her ?


Dolly .
I 'll try !
And you must take Lucas in hand - -


Matt .
H 'm !
Is n't Harry the right person - - ?


Dolly .
No , I sha 'n' t tell Harry .
Harry would only get into a temper and muddle it .
No , you must get Lucas to take himself off .


Matt .
Take himself off !


Dolly .
I wo n't have him here .
You can tell him so .
Be very severe with him .


Matt .
[ Dubious . ]
H 'm !


Dolly .
Take a very high tone .


Matt .
I 'm not sure that taking a high tone is quite in my line .


Dolly .
Then please try it .
Dad , you do realize how very serious this is , do n't you ?


Matt .
Yes , of course .
Very well , I 'll tackle Lucas .
We 'll see what a high tone will do with him .
Heigho !
Sad !
Sad !!
Sad !!!
- Sad !
Sad !!
Sad !!!
[ 33 ]


Dolly .
Hush !


Lucas and Harry enter .
Lucas looks round for Renie .
Dolly and Matt talk in whispers as if settling a plan .
Harry goes up to the collecting-box , takes out his knife and begins to scrape off the label .
Dolly .
[ In a very severe tone to Lucas , who is peeping into conservatory . ]
Are you looking for anything ?


Lucas .
I was wondering whether there was any tea going .


Dolly .
[ Same severe tone . ]
The tea is not in the conservatory .


Lucas .
No , but I thought it might be getting on to the time - -


Dolly .
[ Same tone . ]
The tea will be served in due course .


Lucas .
[ Surprised at her tone . ]
Is anything the matter ?


[ Dolly looks at him severely , says nothing , turns to Matt .
Lucas looks puzzled , goes away , and again looks furtively into conservatory for Renie .


Harry .
[ Scraping away at the collecting-box . ]
Do n't forget , Doll - our cosy half hour after tea - -


[ Nodding at the writing-desk .


Dolly .
I wo n't forget .


Matt .
[ Has come up behind Harry , touches the arm he is scraping with . ]
Hospital for Incurables !
I should n't scrape that off at present .


CURTAIN .


[ 34 ]


( Four or five hours pass between Acts I and II . )


ACT II .


Scene : The same , on the same evening , after dinner .
The sofa is now brought down below the fireplace , and fronts the audience a little diagonally , its right end being farthest up stage .
The small table with the hospital box , and the easy chair are above the sofa , a little to the right of it .


Enter Renie , much distressed and agitated .
Dolly follows quickly , closes the door cautiously and mysteriously .
Renie .
But I do n't understand .
Captain Wentworth and I have been so little together - -


Dolly .
Well , my dear , there it is !
My father is the last man to pry into other people 's affairs , but you see it has been forced upon his notice .
And from the tone he took - -


Renie .
What tone ?


Dolly .
He was very severe .


Renie .
[ Alarmed . ]
But what did he say he had seen ?


Dolly .
He would n't go into particulars .
He seemed very much upset - -


Renie .
Upset ?!


Dolly .
Perhaps I ought to say shocked .


Renie .
Shocked ?!


Dolly .
And when my father is shocked it must be something very glaring - -


Renie .
[ More and more alarmed . ]
But there has n't been anything glaring - -


Dolly .
Well , dear , of course , you know .


Renie .
But I can not imagine - - [ Suddenly . ]
It must have been that day at the stile !
[ 35 ]


Dolly .
Perhaps .
What happened ?
No , I do n't wish to hear - -


Renie .
Captain Wentworth assisted me over the stile - -


Dolly .
Well ?
- -


Renie .
That 's all .
He may have taken a little longer about it than was quite necessary , and I may have leaned a little heavier than the circumstances required .
But it was all done in perfectly good taste .


Dolly .
[ Shakes her head . ]
It ca n't have been the stile .


Renie .
Then what - - ?
[ Cudgels her brains . ]
The dairy !


Dolly .
Very likely .
Was that very - no , do n't tell me - -


Renie .
There 's nothing to tell .
The woman at the farm , Mrs. - -


Dolly .
Biggs - -


Renie .
Biggs , asked me to go over her model dairy .


Dolly .
Did she ask Lucas ?


Renie .
He came .
Mrs. Biggs insisted on our tasting her mince pies - -


Dolly .
Mince pies - ?
Yes ?


Renie .
While she went to get one - -


Dolly .
Get one - -


Renie .
She was n't out of the dairy ten seconds - -


Dolly .
No - and then ?


Renie .
Captain Wentworth - - a - -


Dolly .
Respected you !


Renie .
[ Firing up . ]
He is always most respectful !
In the most delicate , exquisitely chivalrous way , he implored me for one first and only kiss , and just as I was refusing him , somebody passed the dairy windows - -


Dolly .
My father often strolls that way - -


[ 36 ]


Renie .
But I was quite cold and correct - - [ Very anxiously . ]
Dolly , tell me exactly what Mr. Barron said ?


Dolly .
At first he was going to speak to you himself , but I said , `` No , that 's my duty !
I 'm her oldest friend  I 'll talk to her ! ''


Renie .
Ye - es ?


Dolly .
So , at last he consented , and said : `` Very well .
Be very firm with her , because this sort of thing taking place under my very nose and under my daughter 's roof is what I can not , and will not , tolerate for one moment ! ''


Renie .
He must have passed the dairy windows !


Dolly .
Yes .


Renie .
And jumped to a wrong conclusion .


Dolly .
Yes .
And that is n't the worst - -


Renie .
[ Freshly alarmed . ]
Not the worst ?!


Dolly .
Now , do n't be alarmed , dear - -


Renie .
About what ?


Dolly .
Did n't you notice something strange in your husband 's manner at dinner ?


Renie .
No .
What makes you think - - ?


Dolly .
My dear , if my father noticed it , why not your husband ?
Suppose all this time the Professor has been quietly , stealthily watching you and Lucas .


Renie .
[ Alarmed . ]
Dolly !


Dolly .
And waiting his time - -


Renie .
Oh , Dolly !


Dolly .
Did n't you notice how he insisted on your going to the fish-pond ?


Renie .
Yes , he did !


Dolly .
Did n't it strike you there was something in that ?


Renie .
No , and he has n't said anything - -


Dolly .
Of course not .
Naturally he would hide his suspicions from you till the right moment .


Renie .
Right moment ?
[ 37 ]


Dolly .
Now , dear , you see how serious things are .
You must n't run any more risks .
This must be broken off to-night .


Renie .
To-night ?!


Dolly .
Now , what can I do to help you ?


Renie .
You might tell Mr. Barron there was nothing in the dairy windows .


Dolly .
Of course I 'll tell him , but if he saw - -


Renie .
But there was nothing .
Absolutely nothing - -


Dolly .
No , dear .
What else can I do ?


Renie .
Could you find out exactly how much he has seen and heard , and - a - pump him a little ?


Dolly .
I do n't like pumping people - still - What else ?


Renie .
[ Breaking down . ]
Oh , Dolly , this blow could not have fallen at a more cruel moment .


Dolly .
No , dear .


Renie .
It came just when I had lost all the illusions of girlhood , when all my woman 's nature began to cry out - -


Dolly .
Yes - [ Suddenly . ]
Hark !
[ Listens . ]
Hush !


[ Creeps up to door , listens , opens it , looks out , closes it again .


Renie .
What was it ?


Dolly .
Hush !
Voices !
I thought it might be Lucas and the Professor quarrelling .


Renie .
I really do n't think my husband suspects - -


Dolly .
No , I daresay it 's only my imagination .


Renie .
And if he did - Dolly , is there one man living , except my husband , who would condemn me for being the object of a noble , single-hearted devotion like Captain Wentworth 's ?


Dolly .
No , dear , perhaps not .
But , you see , as [ 38 ] husbands they take quite a different view of things from what they do merely as men .


Renie .
Tell me candidly , Dolly , you see nothing wrong in it , do you ?


Dolly .
Well , dear , when you say wrong - -


Renie .
But I assure you there is n't - nothing could be further from my thoughts .


Dolly .
No , dear - still , people are so full of prejudice - now what can I do ?


Renie .
[ Clasping Dolly 's hand warmly . ]
Oh , Dolly , you can help me so much .


Dolly .
[ A little alarmed . ]
Can I ?
Tell me - -


Renie .
If Lucas and I are parted - - [ Breaks down . ]
I ca n't bear it !
I ca n't bear it !


Dolly .
Try , dear !
Try !


Renie .
[ Sobbing . ]
I will .
And if at any time I long to hear how he bears our separation , you wo n't mind receiving a letter , and sending it on to me ?


Dolly .
I 'm afraid I could n't do that , dear .
You see , I 'm so careless , and if I left the letter about , and Harry found it - no , dear - -


Renie .
You wo n't help me ?


Dolly .
Yes , dear , I 'll do anything in my power !
[ Suddenly . ]
I 'll tell you what I can do !


Renie .
Yes ?


Dolly .
My father is telling Lucas he must leave to-night .
Well , I can spare you all the pain and misery of saying `` Good-bye , '' and take one last message to him .


Renie .
[ Curtly . ]
No , thank you .
It 's most unkind of you to send him away like this .
I must see him alone before he goes .


Dolly .
[ Shakes her head . ]
My father insists , and suppose Lucas feels that he owes it to your reputation to go quietly - -


Renie .
Without seeing me ?!
[ 39 ]


Dolly .
And suppose the Professor is really watching you - -


[ Renie shows great perplexity .
Dolly is watching her .


Dolly .
If you do n't see Lucas , what message shall I take him ?


Renie .
Tell him how proud I am of his noble , unselfish devotion  tell him I shall always look upon it as the one supreme happiness of my life to have known him - -


The Professor and Matthew enter .
The Professor has diagrams and illustrations in his hand .
Following the Professor and Matt are Harry and Lucas .
Lucas , after a little time , comes up to Dolly and Renie , who are seated on sofa .
The Professor is speaking to Matt as he enters , and is showing him an illustration .
Prof. [ In his hard , metallic voice . ]
Observe that woman 's facial angle - [ pointing ] the peculiar curve of the lip , and the irregular formation of the nose .


[ Describing a little upward curve on the paper with his thumb .


Matt .
I have seen sweeter things in ladies ' lips and noses .


[ Describing the same little upward curve with his thumb on the paper .


Prof. Can you be surprised at her history ?


Matt .
Who was she ?


Prof. Jane Sweetman , the notorious trigamist .
Looking at that woman 's cranium I maintain it was impossible for her to avoid - -


Matt .
Committing trigamy ?


Prof. Well , some species of grave moral delinquency .
[ 40 ]


[ Dolly clutches Renie 's wrist significantly .
The Professor hands the illustration to Harry , who examines it .
Matt moves away a step and unobtrusively feels his own nose and forehead .


Harry .
[ Has examined the illustration . ]
By Jove , yes - anybody can see she was bound to come a moral cropper , eh ?


[ He hands the illustration to Dolly , who passes it to Renie , with a very significant glance , pointing out something on the paper .
Lucas leans over the back of the sofa between Renie and Dolly to look at the illustration .
As he leans on the back of the sofa , Dolly draws herself up very indignantly , gives him a severe look  moves a little away from him , sits and looks very severely in front of her .
He can not understand her attitude , draws back a little and looks puzzled .


Prof. [ Bringing out another illustration , offering it to Matt . ]
Now look at this .


Matt .
[ Taking illustration . ]
Somebody 's brains !


Prof. Tell me if you notice anything peculiar .


[ Harry leans over Matt 's shoulder , and looks at the illustration .
Lucas again leans over the sofa , between Dolly and Renie .
Dolly again moves a little further away from him with another indignant look .
Lucas is again puzzled , but bends and looks over the illustration in Renie 's hands .


Lucas .
So that 's Jane Sweetman !
Well , if Jane [ 41 ] was bound to come a moral cropper , I 'm very glad I was n't bound to come a moral cropper with Jane , eh , Dolly ?
[ Very pleasantly .


Dolly .
[ Very severely . ]
I should scarcely have thought you troubled whom you came a moral cropper with !


[ Looks at him severely , goes up to writing-desk , seats herself and writes letter .
He feels himself snubbed , and moves a step or two back , stands and looks puzzled .
Professor has been critically regarding Matt and Harry , who have been looking at the illustration .


Prof. Well , does anything strike you ?


Matt .
No .
[ Holding it out . ]
Looks rather pulpy - rather - a - squashy - -


Prof. Exactly !
Observe the soft , almost watery condition of that gray matter .
What is the inevitable consequence ?


Matt .
I could n't quite say - whom did that gray matter belong to ?


Prof. Harriet Poy .


Matt .
I do n't remember Harriet - -


Prof. The Pyromaniac .
At the age of four set fire to her mother 's bed .
At twelve was found saturating blankets with petroleum  at sixteen fired three hayricks , for which she was sentenced to six months ' imprisonment .


Matt .
Poor Harriet !
But of course if her gray matter went and got watery - -


Prof. Just so !
I maintain that with her gray matter in that condition it was a stupid crime to send her to prison .


Dolly .
[ Looking round from desk . ]
But what are we to do with people whose gray matter goes wrong ?
[ 42 ]


Prof. I propose to deal with that question at Edinburgh .
[ To Matt . ]
You might , perhaps , care to run down to Edinburgh for my lectures - -


Matt .
I should love it above all things  but the fact is , I 'm so thoroughly of your opinion - -


Prof. Are you ?!
I 'm delighted I 've convinced you .


Matt .
Completely .
All my life I 've been doing things I should never have dreamed of doing if my gray matter had done its duty and not got watery .


Harry .
[ Begins . ]
Yes , when you come to think of all the rotten things you find yourself doing , you feel , by Jove - -


[ Suddenly recalls that he has said `` by Jove , '' and being near the collection-box , he quietly pulls sixpence out of his pocket and drops it in .


Matt .
Bravo , Harry !
[ Patting him .


Harry .
Oh , I mean it !
- Professor , is n't it time for our hundred up ?


Prof. [ Taking out watch . ]
In two minutes .


Harry .
I 'll go and get the balls out and chalk the cues .
[ Going up to door . ]
Doll , [ taps the writing-desk ] you put it off after tea - by-and-by , you know !


Dolly .
[ She has finished letter , has risen , and closed writing-desk . ]
By-and-by .


Harry .
Before we go to bed - do n't forget .


Dolly .
Oh , I sha 'n' t forget .


[ Makes a wry face .
Exit Harry .


Prof. Renie , you were complaining of headache .
It would be wise to take a short stroll in the cool air .


Renie .
Oh , very well .


Prof. Wrap up thoroughly .
Ten minutes , not longer .


[ 43 ]


[ Exit .
Dolly , unseen by Renie and Lucas , slips the note she has been writing into Matt 's hands .
He takes it down stage , right , and reads it .
Renie and Lucas have been talking , apart  they move towards the door to get out , but Dolly is standing in the way of their exit .


Dolly .
Oh , Renie !
I 'll put on my things , and come with you .


Renie .
But Captain Wentworth has offered - -


Dolly .
I 've a splitting headache - I must get a little air .
And Dad wants to have a talk with Lucas , do n't you ?


Matt .
If he can spare five minutes .


Lucas .
Wo n't by-and-by be just as convenient ?


Dolly .
[ Facing Lucas , speaking firmly . ]
No , by-and-by will not be just as convenient .
Now , Renie , we 'll leave them together .


[ Gets Renie off , turns , looks daggers at Lucas , goes off after Renie , closes door in his face .
He opens it , and goes after her .


Lucas .
I say , Doll , what 's up ?
[ Follows her off . ]
What 's the matter ?


Matt .
[ Reading Dolly 's note . ]
`` Be very severe with him .
Make a great point of the dairy windows .
He 'll understand . ''
Dairy windows ?


[ Puts the note in his pocket , as Lucas re-enters , puzzled and disappointed .


Lucas .
I ca n't think what 's the matter with Dolly .
She has done nothing but snub me all the evening .


Matt .
[ Looking at him sternly . ]
So I should imagine !


Lucas .
[ Startled by his manner . ]
I say , have I done anything ?


Matt .
Done anything !
I 'm a man of the world !
nobody can accuse me of being strait-laced , and [ 44 ] therefore I suppose you think you can come here and set at defiance all the - - it 's disgraceful !


Lucas .
Would you mind telling me what you 're hinting at ?


Matt .
I 'm not hinting !
I 'm going to speak out very plainly , and I tell you that I look upon your conduct as something atrocious !


Lucas .
I say , Uncle , what 's all this about ?


Matt .
What 's it about ?
What 's it about ?
It 's about the dairy windows !


Lucas .
Then it was you - phew !
- so it was you ?


Matt .
Well , after the dairy windows , can you stand there and tell me you are n't thoroughly , completely , heartily ashamed of yourself ?


Lucas .
Well , I suppose I am .
But , after all , it was n't so very bad - -


Matt .
Not bad ?!


Lucas .
Well , not so d - ee - d awful .


Matt .
[ Regards him for a few moments . ]
Well , I 'm astonished !
If you do n't consider your behaviour d - ee - d awful , will you please find me some word that will describe it ?


Lucas .
You know you 're putting a much worse construction on this than the necessities of the case demand .


Matt .
What ?!


Lucas .
I 've nothing to reproach myself with .
Mrs. Biggs was n't out of the dairy three minutes , and you were hanging about the windows all the time .


Matt .
I was hanging about the windows ?


Lucas .
Yes , and I must say that when you saw two people engaged in an interesting conversation the least you could do was to pass on and take no notice .


Matt .
`` Interesting conversation '' ?!


Lucas .
Well , what did you call it ?
If it comes to that , what do you accuse me of ?
[ 45 ]


Matt .
Well , here you are , on the first day of the year , after listening to a most eloquent sermon , after making a solemn resolution to give up all your bad habits - -


Lucas .
Excuse me , I expressly stated that I did n't mean to give up all my bad habits .
And I do n't call this a bad habit .


Matt .
You do n't call making love to a married woman a bad habit ?!


Lucas .
Of course in one sense it is a bad habit .
But it is n't a bad habit in the sense that other bad habits are bad habits .
Look at all the decent chaps who 've been led into it !


Matt .
That does n't excuse you .
And if you think that I 'm going to countenance your conduct , you are very much mistaken in your estimate of my character .


Lucas .
[ Very quietly . ]
May I ask you one simple question ?


Matt .
Well ?


Lucas .
When you were my age , if you found yourself alone in a dairy with a good-looking woman , and she was good for a dozen kisses or so , would n't you have taken advantage of it ?


Matt .
No !


Lucas .
Not at my age ?


Matt .
No - no - -


Lucas .
Well , what would you have done ?


Matt .
I should have summoned all my resolution - -


Lucas .
Oh , that be hanged !
Come , Uncle , no humbug !
Man to man !


Matt .
Well , I do n't say that at your age I might not have been tempted - and of course we must all go through a certain amount of experience , or how should we be able to advise you youngsters ?


Lucas .
I say , no confounded nonsense - your uncle Archie - [ 46 ] -


Matt .
Dear old chap !


Lucas .
What use did you make of his advice ?


Matt .
Well , I remember his talking to me very seriously - I suppose I was about your age - did I ever tell you , Lucas , [ taking Lucas 's arm affectionately ] about a very remarkable auburn-haired girl , Madge Seaforth ?


Lucas .
No .


Matt .
And my racing her across Salisbury Plain at night ?


Lucas .
No .


Matt .
Forty-eight miles one glorious May night !
I let her beat me !
God bless her !
I let her beat me !
And just as the sun rose we caught sight of Salisbury spire .


Lucas .
Sounds rather jolly !


Matt .
Jolly ?
And the bacon and eggs we got through for breakfast !
Jolly ?
It was romance !
It was poetry !
Ah !
Lu , my boy , you may say what you like , there 's nothing like it on this side heaven .
I told you about Mrs. Satterwaite dressing up as a widow and selling her husband ?


Lucas .
No ?


Matt .
Well , I bet the little hussy a fiver .
Oh , Satterwaite richly deserved all he got - I can see Satterwaite 's face now , and hers , as she stepped out of the cupboard , with the wickedest twinkle in the wickedest black eye !
Ho !
Ho !
Heigho !
Sad !
Sad !!
Sad !!!
- Sad !
Sad !!
Sad !!!
Come , come , Lucas !
This wo n't do !
This will never do !
Now to get back to this business of yours - -


Lucas .
Well - -


Matt .
When I was your guardian I let you have a pretty good fling ?


Lucas .
You did !


Matt .
The pace was rather scorching ?
[ 47 ]


Lucas .
Rather !


Matt .
I never pulled you up ?


Lucas .
No , and I 'm grateful .


[ Shaking hands very cordially .


Matt .
That 's all right .
Now , old chap , you 've got to pull up !


Lucas .
Pull up ?


Matt .
Short .
This Mrs. Sturgess - Dolly says there 's a lot of nonsense going on , gushing letters and so on , - damned silly thing writing letters , Lu - -


Lucas .
Yes , I know .


Matt .
Well , what do you do it for ?


Lucas .
I do n't know .


Matt .
You 're seeing her every day .
If you must carry on this tomfoolery , why not do it by word of mouth ?
Why write it down , to show what an ass you 've been ?


Lucas .
I 'm sure I do n't know .


Matt .
Do you know why you 're carrying on with her at all ?


Lucas .
Well , naturally a chap - naturally - -


Matt .
You 're either in love with her , or you are n't ?


Lucas .
I ca n't say I 'm exactly in love with her - -


Matt .
Then why are you making love to her ?


Lucas .
Well , she 's a jolly good-looking woman , and naturally a chap - naturally - I do n't know that I ai n't a bit in love with her .


Matt .
Well , it does n't much matter .
If you are n't in love with her you 're a fool to risk a scandal .
If you are in love you 'll most likely do some silly jackass thing that will knock your career on the head , eh ?


Lucas .
Well , when you look at it that way - -


Matt .
Look at it that way !
Anyhow , she 's a married woman , and you 're here as a guest - it is n't the right thing to do , is it ?


Lucas .
No , it is n't .
[ 48 ]


Matt .
Very well , then , do n't do it .
Do n't do it !
Cut it !
You will ?


Lucas .
I 've got to , I suppose .


Matt .
Yes , you 've got to .
You can tell Doll I gave it to you hot and strong , and you 're going to clear out , and not see Mrs. Sturgess again - -


Lucas .
Not see her again ?


Matt .
Is n't that what you mean to do ?


Lucas .
Yes , I suppose .
I say , what did you see at the dairy windows ?


Matt .
I did n't see anything at all !


Lucas .
Nothing at all ?


Matt .
I was n't there !


Lucas .
Then how - - ?


Matt .
Dolly put me up to it .
[ Laughs at him .


Lucas .
Dolly ?


Dolly enters with a cloak which she throws on sofa .
Matt .
Ah , Doll - -


Dolly .
[ Looking severely at Lucas . ]
Have you spoken to him ?


Matt .
Yes , very seriously , extra seriously , and he 's going to do the right thing and clear out , are n't you , Lucas ?


Lucas .
[ A little unwillingly . ]
Yes .


Matt .
[ Clapping him on the shoulder . ]
Good chap !
Good chap !


Dolly .
[ Still a little severe . ]
I 'm pleased to hear it .
[ To Lucas . ]
You 've behaved in a most scandalous - -


Matt .
He has .
I 've told him all that .
[ Winks at Dolly to keep her quiet . ]
And he sees it quite plainly , do n't you ?


[ Winks at Lucas to prompt him .


Dolly .
Then it 's quite broken off ?


Matt .
Quite !
Is n't it , Lu ?


Lucas .
Yes , I suppose .
I should like to say - -


Dolly .
Yes ?
[ 49 ]


Lucas .
That nothing has taken place which , if rightly looked at , could reflect discredit either upon the lady , or , I hope , upon myself .
And secondly , whatever fault there may have been , is entirely mine .


Matt .
That 's satisfactory !
It always ought to be the man 's fault .
Heaven forbid it should ever be theirs .
Good chap !
Good chap !
[ Patting him . ]
Dolly , he 's behaving splendidly .
Now , Lu , good-night .


[ Dolly rings bell .


Lucas .
[ Surprised . ]
Good-night ?!


Dolly .
Good-night , and good-bye !
[ Holding out her hand .


Lucas .
You are n't going to turn me out to-night !


Dolly .
You said it was quite broken off .


Lucas .
Yes , but - - [ turns to Matt with appealing gesture .
Uncle , you did n't mean to pack me off like this - -


Matt .
Yes , my boy !
Remember the occasion .
First day of the New Year .
Take time by the forelock .
Off you go !


[ Taking him by the shoulder and trying to get him off .


Lucas .
[ Resisting . ]
Oh no !
I do n't see it in that light at all .


[ Sinks comfortably into arm-chair .


Criddle appears at door .
Dolly .
Criddle , please have Captain Wentworth 's portmanteau taken to the billiard-room .


Criddle .
Yes , ma'am .


Dolly .
He wishes to change there , and please send to the Red Lion and ask them to have Captain Wentworth 's horse saddled .


Criddle .
Yes , ma'am .
[ Going .


Lucas .
Criddle , what 's the weather like ?


Criddle .
It 's a bit colder , sir .
Looks as if we were going to have another heavy fall of snow .
[ 50 ]


Lucas .
I do n't think I 'll go to-night , Criddle .
If I want the gee saddled , I 'll go and tell them myself .


Criddle .
Yes , sir .
[ Exit .


Lucas .
[ In arm-chair . ]
I say , Dolly , you do n't really expect me to go careering over that heath at this ungodly hour ?


Dolly .
You ca n't stay here .
Renie is very much upset  she has had hysterics .
So I 've put her in the spare room .


Lucas .
Well , you can give me a shake-down somewhere - in the billiard-room .


Dolly .
[ Shakes her head . ]
I ca n't ask the servants to make up impossible beds in impossible places at this ungodly hour .


Lucas .
I call this beastly unfair of you , Doll .


Dolly .
Unfair ?


Lucas .
Just as I 'd summoned up all my resolution to do the right thing , and avoid ructions for your sake , you pounce down on me , and order me off the premises , and - -


Dolly .
[ Getting angry . ]
If you do n't behave yourself and go off quietly , I shall have to order you off the premises .


[ Makes an appeal by gesture to Matt to get him off .


Matt .
Now , my hero !
[ Lifting him out of the arm-chair . ]
Buckle on your armor !
Sally forth !
Once more unto the breach !


[ With some difficulty he raises Lucas out of the chair .


Lucas .
Well , I 'll go and have a look at the weather .
[ Goes sulkily up to door . ]
Mind you , if you turn me out I wo n't be responsible if there 's a flare up - -


Dolly .
Very well , so long as we do n't have a flare-up here .
Oh !


[ Rings the bell again .


[ 51 ]


Lucas .
[ Goes off , sulky , muttering . ]
Of all the - turning me out - beastly infernal nuisance !


[ Exit grumbling , leaving door open .


Dolly .
It would serve them both right if there was to be a flare-up - only I 'm sure she 'd drag me into it somehow .
[ Criddle appears at door . ]
Please send and ask them at the Red Lion to saddle Captain Wentworth 's horse and send it here at once .


Criddle .
Yes , ma'am .
[ Exit .


Dolly .
Lucas is going to behave as badly over this as he did over the governess .
Dad - - !


Matt .
Well ?


Dolly .
Of course , Lucas is in the army , but surely he - he is n't a fair sample ?


Matt .
Oh no , oh no !
Lucas is very exceptional - quite exceptional .


Dolly .
I thought so !
They ca n't all be - -


Matt .
Oh no !
I 'm glad to say - -


Dolly .
I 'm determined he shall go to-night .


Lucas re-enters .
Lucas .
I say , Dolly , I wish you 'd come and look at the weather .


Dolly .
What for ?


Lucas .
There 's a great black cloud - it 's going to come down !


Dolly .
[ Enraged . ]
I do n't care if the heavens come down !
You 're going back to Aldershot to-night .


Lucas .
But I tell you - - [ Appeals to Matt . ]
It 's simply impossible for me to ride across that heath - -


Matt .
But you rode across it last night in a howling snowstorm - -


Lucas .
Yes , I did !
Last night !
And never again , thank you !
No !
I do n't mind shaking down anywhere to oblige - -


[ 52 ]


[ He is about to drop again into the arm-chair , but Matt gently pushes him aside and drops into the chair himself .


Lucas .
[ Going to sofa . ]
Anywhere to oblige !


[ Drops comfortably on to sofa .


Dolly .
[ Comes up to him finally . ]
Lucas , this is abominable !
I suppose you think because we treated you so leniently over that wretched governess - -


Lucas .
Well , I thought you were pretty deuced hard down on us - -


Dolly .
What ?!
Oh !
[ Appeals to Matt .


Lucas .
I did n't mind your slanging me , but you might have had a little consideration for her feelings , because , after all , she was one of your own sex !


Dolly .
My own sex !
The minx !


Lucas .
And an orphan !


Dolly .
Orphan !
[ To Matt . ]
Go and speak to him !
Go and speak to him !


[ Matt rises and goes to Lucas .
Dolly sits down in despair .


Matt .
Come , Lu .
You 're not playing the game !
You promised to take yourself off .


Lucas .
[ Comfortably seated . ]
Well , I will take myself off , only let me take myself off in my own way .


Dolly .
It 's useless your staying !
Renie wo n't see you again .


Lucas .
Wo n't she ?


Dolly .
No .
She gave me a last message for you - -


Lucas .
Did she ?
Why did n't you give it to me ?


Dolly .
If I tell you , will you take yourself off ?


Lucas .
Yes , of course .
What was her last message ?


Dolly .
She said `` She should always value your noble devotion , and be proud that she had known you  but you must see how hopeless it was , and that she trusted you would go away at once and leave her to respect you , as you had always respected her ! ''
[ 53 ]


Matt .
A very pretty , touching little adieu !
Does her great credit .
Now , Lu !
Cut it !
Come , my boy !


[ Lifts him up off sofa .
Lucas gets up very reluctantly .


Lucas .
Well , if I must go - good-night !


Matt .
Good-night .
[ Shaking hands . ]
I may see you to-morrow afternoon .


Lucas .
Where ?


Matt .
I 'm driving over to Aldershot to see Sir John .
I shall look you up - -


Lucas .
I may not be there in the afternoon - -


Dolly .
Lucas , you 're coming over here - -


Lucas .
No - no  I 'm not .
You should n't suspect me .


Dolly .
It wo n't be the least use your coming - -


Lucas .
I know that .
Well , good-bye , Doll - -


Dolly .
Good-bye .
[ Shaking hands .


Lucas .
[ Is going up to door slowly and reluctantly , turns . ]
I suppose if I were to give you my solemn promise I would n't see her , I could n't shake down on that sofa .


Dolly .
[ Sternly and decisively . ]
No !


Lucas .
[ Goes a few more steps towards door , turns . ]
I suppose I could n't see Mrs. Sturgess ?
[ Dolly looks indignant . ]
Only to say good-bye .


Dolly .
No !
She was nearly undressed when I left her .
She 's asleep by now !


Enter Renie fully dressed , looking very interesting and tearful .
Throughout the scene she preserves the air of a martyr .


Dolly .
[ Indignantly . ]
Renie , you promised me you would n't come downstairs again !


Renie .
Yes , dear , but I felt I could n't rest under your father 's unjust suspicion .
[ Goes up to Matt , seizes his hand sympathetically . ]
Dolly tells me you [ 54 ] have been watching the friendship that all unconsciously has sprung up between Captain Wentworth and myself - -


Matt .
[ Uncomfortable . ]
Not exactly watching - -


Renie .
I feel you may have seen , or guessed something , that has given you a wrong impression .


Matt .
No , no !
I assure you - -


Renie .
If you have , I beg you to speak out and give us a chance of defending ourselves .
Tell us exactly what you have seen , and what you suspect - -


Matt .
My dear Mrs. Sturgess , I have n't seen anything , and I do n't suspect anything .


Renie .
You really mean that ?


Matt .
Yes - yes - -


Renie .
[ Clasping his hand eagerly . ]
Thank you so much .
Friendship between a man and a woman is so misunderstood .


Matt .
It is .


Dolly .
Yes , Lucas had a friendship with a governess here which we all misunderstood - till afterwards .


Lucas .
I say , Dolly , do n't you - -


Renie .
Now that there is no chance of your misjudging our friendship , I do n't mind saying - - [ Shows signs of breaking down . ]
You wo n't misunderstand me ?
[ Clinging to his hand .


Matt .
No , no !


Renie .
My life has not been altogether a happy one .


Matt .
I 'm sure it has n't !


Renie .
Under other circumstances - let that pass !
[ Wrings Matt 's hands . ]
Thank you , thank you !
[ Goes to Lucas . ]
Captain Wentworth , I shall always be proud to have known you .


Dolly .
I 've told him all that !


[ Matt hushes Dolly with a gesture .


Renie .
I shall always cherish the memory of our [ 55 ] friendship , but it might be misunderstood , and so [ breaking down , but bearing up with an effort ] , you will behave like the gallant gentleman I know you to be , and say good-bye to me for ever !


Matt .
Nobly spoken !
Very nobly spoken indeed !


Lucas .
Well , if you insist - -


Renie .
I do !
Good-bye for ever !


Lucas .
Good-bye .
[ They have a long hand-shake .


Renie .
Good-bye .


[ Tears herself away from him and tragically throws herself on sofa .
Lucas follows her up .


Lucas .
I say , Mrs. Sturgess - -


Renie .
[ Face buried in hands , moans out . ]
Go , go !
In pity 's name do n't make it harder for me !


Matt .
In pity 's name do n't make it harder for her .


Dolly .
[ Looking off at door . ]
They 'll be coming out of the billiard-room directly .


Matt .
Now , Lucas - -


Criddle appears at door .
Criddle .
Your horse is waiting for you , sir .


Lucas .
My horse ?!


Criddle .
Yes , sir , just outside .


Lucas .
What on earth do they mean ?
A valuable horse like that - just clipped - standing about on a night like this - who told them ?


Dolly .
I did .
The horse is waiting to take you back to Aldershot .


Lucas .
I ca n't go back to Aldershot in this kit .
[ Pointing to his dress-clothes . ]
Tell them to take it back to the Red Lion !


Dolly .
And Criddle , give the man Captain Wentworth 's portmanteau to take to the Red Lion at the same time .


Criddle .
Yes , ma'am .
[ Exit .
[ 56 ]


Lucas .
[ Grumbling . ]
Well , of all - - Good-bye , Mrs. Sturgess .


Dolly .
You 've said good-bye - -


Renie .
[ Still tragic on sofa . ]
Farewell - for ever !


Lucas .
Good-night , Dolly !


Dolly .
Farewell - for a good long time .
[ Shaking hands .


Lucas .
Good-night , Uncle .


Matt .
Good-night , Lucas .
[ Shaking hands .


Lucas .
[ Turns at door . ]
Happen to have your cigar-case handy ?


[ Matt takes out cigar-case , offers it .


Lucas .
Could you spare two ?


Matt .
Certainly !


Lucas .
I 've got a jolly long ride , I 'll take three if you do n't mind .


Matt .
Do !


Lucas .
Thank ` ee .
Well , good-night , everybody .


[ Matt gets Lucas off , closes door after him .


Renie .
[ Rouses herself from sofa . ]
Has he gone ?
Is it all over ?


Dolly .
I hope so .
[ Goes and rings bell twice .


Renie .
[ Goes to Matt impulsively - and seizes his hand . ]
At least this bitter experience has gained me one true friend .


Matt .
[ Embarrassed . ]
Yes - -


Renie .
[ Wrings his hand in gratitude . ]
Thank you so much - -


[ He gets away from her and shows relief  takes out cigar and prepares to light it .


Renie .
[ Standing in the middle of the room , pitying herself . ]
That 's where we get the worst of it , we women who have hearts !
We must feel , we must show our feelings , and then we get trampled down in the fight .
Oh , Dolly , how I envy you your nature !
[ 57 ]


Dolly .
[ Very chilly . ]
Are you going into the spare room , dear ?


Renie .
Anywhere !
Anywhere !
Yes , the spare room !


Peters , Dolly 's maid , appears at door .
Dolly .
Peters , will you bank up the fire in the spare room and make everything comfortable for Mrs. Sturgess ?


Peters .
Yes , ma'am .
[ Exit .


Renie .
[ Still in the middle of the room , pitying herself . ]
So my poor little tragedy is ended !
[ To Matt .


Matt .
Yes .
Well , let 's be thankful no bones are broken !


Renie .
No bones , but how about hearts ?
Well , I must bear it .
[ With a weary smile . ]
Must n't I ?


Matt .
I 'm afraid you must .


Renie .
Good-night !
[ Wrings his hand with gratitude . ]
Good-night !


Matt .
Good-night .


[ Gets away from her , and busies himself with his cigar , lights it .


Renie .
Good-night , Dolly !


Dolly .
I 'll come up with you , and stay till you 're quite comfortable .


Renie .
Shall I ever be comfortable again ?
Will things ever be the same ?
I wonder !


[ Goes off mournfully and tragically at back with a prolonged sigh .
Matt has seated himself on sofa and taken up paper .


Dolly .
[ Calls his attention to Renie 's exit and makes a furious gesture after her . ]
I know she 'll be here next Christmas !


[ 58 ]


Marches down enraged to Matt and repeats in an angry , aggrieved way , emphasizing each word . ]
I know that woman will be here next Christmas !


Matt .
[ Seated comfortably with his cigar and paper ] I daresay she will - -


[ Dolly marches indignantly and decisively to door and exit .


CURTAIN .


[ 59 ]


( Half an hour passes between Acts II and III . )


ACT III .


Scene : The same .
Discover Matt in the same seat and attitude , with paper and cigar .
Dolly enters .


Matt .
Well ??


Dolly .
I 've had an awful time with her - -


Matt .
How ?


Dolly .
[ Seated . ]
First she had another fit of hysterics - then she longed to go out into the night air to cool her fevered brow - then she moaned out something about her noble Lucas - -


Matt .
And now ?


Dolly .
I 've persuaded her to let Peters undress her .
I 've got her off my hands at last .


Matt .
That 's a comfort .


Dolly .
Dad !


Matt .
Yes .


Dolly .
I wo n't have her here next Christmas .


Matt .
No , I would n't .


Dolly .
[ Repeats in a slow , aggrieved , enraged way , emphasizing each syllable . ]
Whatever happens , I will not have that woman in my house next Christmas .
You hear that ?


Matt .
Yes .
You wo n't have her here next Christmas !


Dolly .
I mean it , this time .
And I wo n't have Lucas here again for a very long time .


Matt .
I would n't .


Dolly .
[ Seated beside him . ]
Dad , please put away that paper .
You 're going over to Aldershot to-morrow to try to get Lucas exchanged ?


Matt .
I 'll try .


Dolly .
Where can you get him sent ?
[ 60 ]


Matt .
Gibraltar - India - South Africa - according as an appointment happens to be vacant .


Dolly .
The further the better , and the longer .


Peters appears at door .
Dolly .
Well , Peters , have you made Mrs. Sturgess comfortable ?


Peters .
I 'm trying to , ma'am .


Dolly .
Is she in bed yet ?


Peters .
No , ma'am .


Dolly .
Not in bed !


Peters .
No , ma'am , but she seems rather quieter .


Dolly .
She let you undress her , I suppose ?


Peters .
I 'm just going to , ma'am .
She says her brain is still throbbing .


Dolly .
Throbbing !


Peters .
And could you lend her your hop-pillow ?


Dolly .
You 'll find it in my wardrobe .


Peters .
Yes , ma'am .


Dolly .
Peters , pat up the hop-pillow for her , and insist on undressing her - -


Peters .
Yes , ma'am .
[ Going .


Dolly .
Do n't leave her till you 've seen her comfortably in bed .


Peters .
No , ma'am .


[ Exit .
A gust of wind and a little rattle of hail on the conservatory window .


Matt .
Whew !
The New Year means business !


Dolly .
And so do I , as Lucas will find out .


Matt .
He is finding it out , on that heath !


Dolly .
Yes !
[ With a little laugh . ]
Ha !
ha !
[ A louder gust and rattle of hail . ]
Listen !
Listen !
Ha !
And he might have been here playing a comfortable rubber by the fire - if he 'd simply behaved himself !
[ 61 ]


Matt .
If he 'd `` simply behaved '' himself !
What we all miss through not `` simply behaving '' ourselves .


[ Another gust .


Dolly .
[ Laughs . ]
Ah !
He 's catching it !
I shall insist on Renie driving out with me to-morrow afternoon .


Matt .
Yes .


Dolly .
Then she ca n't meet Lucas .
That will be another sell for him - [ Another furious gust and rattle . ]
Listen !
Ha !
ha !
I wonder how far Lucas has got !


[ A noise of something being knocked over in the conservatory , which is lighted .


Matt .
[ Goes to the conservatory door , looks in  is startled . ]
Hillo !
hillo !
What ?!


Lucas enters from the upper conservatory door in riding-clothes of first Act .
Dolly .
[ Enraged . ]
Lucas !
[ More enraged . ]
Lucas !
How dare you ?!


Lucas .
It 's all right - do n't make a fuss !


Dolly .
[ Furious . ]
Why are n't you on the way to Aldershot ?


Lucas .
I did n't like the look of the weather !
I did n't like the look of it at all !
So I got them to give me a shake-down at the Red Lion - -


Dolly .
[ Indignantly . ]
Shake-down at the Red Lion !


Lucas .
Yes , on their sofa !
You need n't look so black !
I asked you first , to let me have a shake-down here - on that sofa - -


Dolly .
But why have you come back here ?


Lucas .
Well , I must have dropped those cigars uncle Matt gave me .
I put them carefully in my side pocket , and when I got down to the Red Lion , lo and behold , they were n't there !


Dolly .
You could have got a cigar at the Red Lion - [ 62 ] -


Lucas .
[ Turns to Matt for sympathy . ]
I could have got a cigar at the Red Lion !
[ To Dolly . ]
No , thank you !
So I thought I 'd just stroll up here in the hope - -


Dolly .
In the hope of seeing Mrs. Sturgess !
But she 's safely in bed this time , and there 's no possible chance of your seeing her .


Lucas .
In the hope of getting Harry to give me a decent smoke .
Well , I came into the Hall and not wishing to rile you by my hated presence - I slipped into the conservatory - -


Enter Harry .
Harry .
[ Surprised at the riding-clothes . ]
Hillo , Lu , going back to Aldershot to-night ?


Lucas .
No , not unless the weather takes a turn .
No , Dolly said that as the spare room was occupied , would I mind getting a shake-down at the Red Lion .
So I did , and as I 've got nothing to smoke , may I cadge a cigar ?


Harry .
Yes , old fellow .
[ Taking out cigar-case .


Dolly .
[ Intercepting . ]
You said I should take charge of your cigars , in case you should be tempted to smoke more than two a day - -


Harry .
By Jove , I forgot all about two per diem - I 've been smoking all day .
Here , Lu !
[ About to throw cigar-case to Lucas . ]
You 'd better take the lot and keep me out of temptation !


Dolly .
No !
I 'll take charge of that , please .


[ Takes the cigar-case , looks angrily at Lucas , goes to writing-desk , puts it in .


Peters appears at door .
Peters .
I beg pardon , ma'am , Mrs. Sturgess - -


Dolly .
What about her ?


Peters .
When I got back with the hop-pillow she was n't there .
I 've looked all over the house , and I [ 63 ] ca n't find her anywhere .
[ Glancing off into the conservatory . ]
Oh , there she is !


Renie enters , fully dressed from conservatory , very languidly , with handkerchief and smelling-salts .
Peters goes off .
Dolly .
Renie !


[ Looks at Matt , who is inclined to laugh , checks it , shrugs his shoulders and goes over to fire .


Renie .
My head was racking , I had to rush out - I 've been pacing up and down under the veranda , up and down , up and down , up and down - [ Dolly makes a little grimace of angry incredulity ] it 's a little easier now , so I 'll take advantage of the lull , and try to get some sleep .


Dolly .
Yes , I would .


Renie .
Good-night , dear .


Dolly .
[ Severely . ]
Good-night once more .


Renie .
Good-night , Mr. Telfer .
[ Offering hand .


Harry .
Good-night , I 'm awfully sorry - -


Renie .
[ With her weary smile . ]
Oh , it 's only a headache .
I can bear it .
Thank you for your sympathy .
[ Wringing his hand in fervent gratitude . ]
Good-night , Mr. Barron .


Matt .
Good-night .
I hope we sha 'n' t have any more little tragedies , eh ?


Renie .
[ Very fervently . ]
I hope not , oh , I hope not !
[ To Lucas very casually and distantly . ]
Good-night , Captain Wentworth .


Lucas .
[ Same tone . ]
Good-night , Mrs. Sturgess .


[ Exit Renie .
Peters is seen to join her in the hall .
A little pause .


Lucas .
Well , I 'll be toddling back to the Red Lion .
Good-night , Dolly .
[ Dolly looks at him , furious , turns away .
Harry looks a little surprised . ]
Good-night , Harry .
[ 64 ]


Harry .
Good-night , Lu .
Seems a pity for you to turn out on a night like this .
Dolly , ca n't we give him a shake-down - - ?


Dolly .
No !


[ Harry shows surprise at her tone .
A little pause of embarrassment .


Lucas .
Good-night , Uncle Matt .


Matt .
[ Comes up to him , in a low voice . ]
Cut it , my dear lad .
Cut it !
That 's understood ?


Lucas .
Yes , of course .
Well , good-night , Dolly , once more .
[ She does n't reply . ]
Oh well , if you 're going on the rampage - [ Goes off muttering . ]
Infernal nuisance - night like this - - [ Exit .


Harry .
Is anything the matter ?


Dolly .
Lucas has offended me very much .
I do n't wish to speak of it .


The Professor enters at back .
Matt .
Well , who was the victor ?


Harry .
The Professor won all four games .


Prof. I ascribe the increased accuracy of my stroke at billiards to my increased nerve force , now I have made Pableine my staple article of diet in place of meat .


Matt .
Flies to the gray matter , eh ?


Prof. Instantaneously .


Matt .
Good stuff !


Prof. I hope you 'll try it .
Shall I send a tin to your room ?


Matt .
Will you ?
That will be kind !


Criddle appears at door .
Criddle .
I 've put the spirits in the hall , sir .


Harry .
You can take them away , Criddle .
In the [ 65 ] future we shall not require spirits at night , only soda water and tea .


Criddle .
Yes , sir .
[ Exit .


Dolly .
[ Who has been sitting wearily on sofa , rises . ]
Well , I 'm going to bed .


Harry .
You forget , dear .


Dolly .
What ?
[ Harry taps the writing-desk . ]
Oh , my dear Harry , we wo n't go into them to-night .


Harry .
Yes , my dear , if you please .
[ Very firmly .
Dolly makes an impatient gesture and pouts . ]
Please do n't look like that .
If I 'm to help you in paying off these bills , it must be to-night , or not at all .


Dolly .
Oh , very well , but - - [ Sits down wearily .


Prof. [ Taking out watch . ]
Five minutes past my usual hour .


Dolly .
Renie has one of her bad headaches , so I 've put her in the spare room .


Prof. Thank you .
I 'm afraid she 's a little wilful .
I can never get her to see that life can yield us no real satisfaction unless we regulate all our actions to the most minute point .
Good-night .


Dolly .
Good-night .
[ Shaking hands .


Prof. Good-night , Telfer .


Harry .
Good-night .
[ Shaking hands .


Matt .
Good-night , Harry .


Harry .
Good-night , Dad .
[ Shaking hands .


Matt .
[ To Dolly . ]
Night-night , dear .


Dolly .
Night-night , Dad .
[ Kissing him .


Prof. [ Has been waiting at door . ]
I might perhaps show you the precise way of mixing the Pableine .


Matt .
That would be kind !
What 's the dose ?


Prof. Two teaspoonfuls .
On certain occasions I have taken as much as four tablespoonfuls .


Matt .
Was n't that rather - going it ?


Prof. No .
It 's quite tasteless , except for a very slight beany flavor .
[ 66 ]


Matt .
Sounds just the thing for a New Year 's drink , to brace up good resolutions .
Come along !
I 'll have a regular night-cap of it .


[ Exeunt Matt and Professor .


Harry .
Now we can have our cosy half hour .


Dolly .
Ye-es .
I 've had an awful evening with Lucas .
Do n't you think - - ?


Harry .
No , my darling .
You put it off after tea - -


Dolly .
But our heads will be so much clearer in the morning - -


Harry .
[ Very solemnly and severely . ]
My darling , remember what Pilcher said about procrastination .
And remember our resolutions last night .
If we break them on the first night of the year , where shall we be on the thirty-first of December ?


Dolly .
I 'm horribly fagged .


Harry .
Conquer it !
Think how delightful it will be to put your head on the pillow to-night , without a single anxiety , without a single thought - -


Dolly .
Except my gratitude to you !


Harry .
Come , dear , no time like the present !


Dolly .
[ Jumps up very briskly . ]
No time like the present !
[ Looking at him with great admiration . ]
Oh , Harry , what a dear , kind , good husband you 've always been to me !


Harry .
Have I , my darling ?
[ Modestly . ]
I 've done my best - -


Dolly .
How I must have tried you !


Harry .
No , dear - at least a little sometimes .


Dolly .
When I think what patience you 've had with me , and never reproached me - -


Harry .
Well , not often .
We 've had our little tiffs - That day at Goodwood - eh ?


Dolly .
Do n't speak of it !
I was to blame - -


Harry .
No , dear , I ca n't let you accuse yourself .
I was quite in the wrong .


Dolly .
No , dear , it was my fault entirely !
[ 67 ]


Harry .
Well , we wo n't quarrel about that .
Now these bills - -


Dolly .
And what good pals we 've been !


Harry .
And always shall be .
[ Kissing her .


Dolly .
[ Hugging him . ]
Oh , you dear !


Harry .
Now , business , business !


Dolly .
[ Going up to writing-desk . ]
What a lucky woman I am !


Harry .
[ Seated at table . ]
Bring them all .


Dolly .
[ Has opened desk and taken up some bills - she looks round dubiously at Harry . ]
What a splendid thing it must be to be a husband and have it in your power to make your wife adore you , by simply paying a few bills .


Harry .
Yes - bring them all .
[ She comes down with a bundle of about fifteen , hands them to him . ]
Is this all ?


Dolly .
All , of any importance .


Harry .
I want to see them all .


Dolly .
So you shall , but we 'll go through these first , because [ lamely ] if you want to ask any questions we can settle them on the spot , ca n't we ?


Harry .
[ Reading from the bill . ]
Maison Récamier , Court and artistic millinery .
By Jove !
[ Looks up .


Dolly .
What !


Harry .
One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine - nine hats !


Dolly .
Different kinds of hats .


Harry .
Yedda straw hat , four guineas , ostrich feather ruffle , twelve pounds ten - -


Dolly .
That was the one - you remember - when I came into the room you said , `` Stay there !
Just as you are !
I must kiss you ! ''


Harry .
Yes , but twelve pounds ten - Moss green chip hat , four , fourteen , six .
Heliotrope velvet toque - [ 68 ] -


Dolly .
That 's the dear little toque you admire so much !


Harry .
Do I ?
Six guineas !
Dear little toque !
Hat in white Tegal with plumes of Nattier Bleu - fifteen guineas - Fifteen guineas ?!


Dolly .
With plumes !
Of Nattier Bleu !


Harry .
But fifteen guineas !


Dolly .
Oh , the woman 's a fearful swindler !
But what are you to do with such people ?


Harry .
[ With bill . ]
Total , sixty-four , seven , six .
And I get my one silk topper a year , at a guinea , and three and six for doing it up .
Total for me , one , four , six .
Total for you - -


Dolly .
My dear Harry , do n't make absurd comparisons !


Harry .
[ Takes another bill . ]
John Spearman , artistic gown maker , ball gowns , reception gowns , race gowns - Good heavens !


Dolly .
What 's the matter ?


Harry .
Total , five hundred and fifty-six pounds - that ca n't be right !


Dolly .
[ Frightened . ]
No , it ca n't be !
Add it up !


Harry .
[ Reading . ]
Tea gown of chiffon taffeta -


Dolly .
The one I took to Folkestone , you remember ?


[ With a little attempt at a kiss .


Harry .
[ Gently repulsing her . ]
No , I do n't .
[ She puts her arms round his neck  he gently pushes her aside . ]
Business first , please .
[ Reads . ]
Gown of white cloth with Postillion coat of Rose du Barri silk , motifs of silver , forty-five guineas - -


Dolly .
You wo n't grumble at that , for when I first put it on , you stood and looked at me and said , `` I want to know how it is , Doll , that the moment a dress gets on to your shoulders , it seems to brisk up , and be as cocky and proud of itself - - ''


[ Again attempting to embrace him .


[ 69 ]


Harry .
[ Again repulsing her . ]
Yes , well now I do know !
Jolly proud and cocky your dresses ought to feel at this price !
[ Reads . ]
`` Evening cloak of strawberry satin charmeuse , trimmed silk passementerie , motifs and fringed stoles of dull gold embroidery , thirty-five guineas . ''
What 's a motif ?


Dolly .
It 's a trimming - a lot of little touches - a sort of - a - a - a - [ making a little descriptive gesture ] a suggestion - a motif - -


Harry .
And Mr. John Spearman 's motif is that I should pay him five hundred and fifty-six pounds .
Well , I do n't like Mr. John Spearman 's motifs , and I 'm not going to fall in with them .
[ Puts the bill on the table rather angrily , takes up another , reads . ]
`` Artistic lingerie ! ''
I wonder why all these people call themselves artists !
`` Underwear of daintiness and distinction . ''


Dolly .
Well , you 've always praised - -


Harry .
Yes .
In future , I 'm going to be very careful what articles of your dress I praise .
`` Three pairs of blue silk garters , forty-five shillings . ''
[ She has settled herself in the armchair , looking a little sulky and obstinate , leaning back and pettishly swinging one leg over the other . ]
What have you got to say to that ?


Dolly .
Garters are necessary .


Harry .
Yes , but why three ?
And why blue silk ?
Why do n't you speak ?


Dolly .
The garters can speak for themselves !


Harry .
Very well .
Garters that can speak for themselves can pay for themselves !
[ Dashes the bill on the table , takes up another .
Reading . ]
Three bottles cœur de Janette - three bottles Souffle de Marguerite - fifteen pounds for scent - and I have to smoke sixpenny cigars !
And sometimes only fourpenny !


Dolly .
Well , if you will smoke those horrid strong [ 70 ] things you ca n't wonder I have to disinfect the house for you .


Harry .
Disinfect the house for me !
You 'll very soon disinfect the house of me !
[ Glances through the remaining bills , groans , puts them on the table , and walks about in despair .
Dolly rises and is going off . ]
Where are you going ?


Dolly .
To bed .


Harry .
[ Stopping her . ]
No !
Now we 've begun , we 'll go through to the bitter end , if you please .
I want you to explain - -


Dolly .
My dear Harry , it will be quite useless for me to try to explain in your present state - -


Harry .
[ Getting furious . ]
In my present state - -


Dolly .
Dancing about the room and shouting !
- -


Harry .
I 'm not shouting !


Dolly .
You 're not shouting ?!


Harry .
No , and if I am , is n't it enough to make a man shout when his wife - -


Matt appears at the door in his dressing-gown and slippers .
Matt .
Excuse my interrupting .
But you know my room is just above this , and if you could manage to pitch your voices in rather a softer key - -


Harry .
By Jove , I 'd forgotten !
We were getting a little noisy .
I 'm awfully sorry .


Matt .
Do n't mention it !
The Professor gave me rather a stiff go of his Pableine , and I fancy it has n't agreed with me [ tapping his chest ] for I ca n't get a wink of sleep .
Is there a spoonful of whiskey about ?


Harry .
On the sideboard in the dining-room .


Matt .
Thankee .
[ Tapping his chest . ]
Harry , when you get over fifty , do n't change your nightcap , or any of your other bad habits .


[ 71 ]


Harry .
I wo n't .
Now , Dolly - -


Matt .
[ Anxiously . ]
You wo n't perhaps be very long now ?


Dolly .
No , we 'd nearly finished - -


Matt .
Nothing serious , I hope ?


Dolly .
Harry does n't approve of my using scent .


Harry .
Not in pailfuls .
Certainly not .


Dolly .
I had three small bottles - -


Matt .
Montaigne says that the sweetest perfume a woman can have , is to have none at all .
[ Exit .


Harry .
Now , my darling , we shall best arrive at an understanding if we avoid all temper , and discuss it in a calm , business-like way .


Dolly .
[ A little frightened . ]
Ye-es - -


Harry .
Very well then , bring up your chair , and let us go into it , figure by figure , item by item , and see how we stand .


Dolly .
Ye-es .
[ Bringing a chair a little way . ]
Harry , you are n't going to be as business-like as all that ?


Harry .
As all what ?


Dolly .
I ca n't discuss it while you keep me at a distance !
[ Suddenly rushes at him , seats herself on his knee , puts his arm round her waist , kisses him . ]
There !
now I feel I can discuss it thoroughly .


Harry .
Very well [ kisses her ] , so long as we do discuss it thoroughly .


Dolly .
I began to get quite frightened of you , Mr. Jobling .


Harry .
Jobling ?


Dolly .
The man Mr. Pilcher had to get a money-box for , because he swore at his wife !


Harry .
Oh , yes .


Dolly .
You got so angry - and shouted - -


Harry .
Well , there was no reason for that , especially as getting out of temper is the one thing I 'm quite resolved to conquer this New Year - [ 72 ] -


Dolly .
[ Kissing him . ]
Do n't forget that !


Harry .
[ Kisses her . ]
Now , business , business !
[ Takes up a bill . ]
What have we here ?
Carchet , gantier et bonnetier , artiste - Hillo , here 's another artist !
In stockings this time .
[ Suddenly . ]
I say !


Dolly .
[ Frightened . ]
Eh ?


Harry .
[ Points to an item in bill . ]
Come now , Dolly - this is really too bad - this really is too bad !


Dolly .
[ Frightened . ]
What ?!


[ Getting off his knee .


Harry .
One dozen pairs best silk hose , with clocks - -


Dolly .
Yes - how much does that come to ?


Harry .
Eleven pounds two - -


Dolly .
It does seem rather a high price , but - -


[ Drawing up her dress and showing an inch or two of silk stocking .


Harry .
You 're wearing them about the house ?


Dolly .
I ca n't go about the house without stockings .
And I put them on for your especial benefit .
[ He utters a contemptuous exclamation . ]
They 're a lovely quality - -


[ Drawing up her dress an inch or two higher .


Harry .
I daresay .
[ Turning away . ]
I 'm not going to admire your stockings , or your ostrich ruffles , or your blue silk garters , or your motifs , or anything that is yours !
It 's too expensive !


Dolly .
[ Dress an inch higher , looking down at her stockings . ]
It 's the clocks you have to pay for - -


Harry .
I beg your pardon , it 's the clocks I have n't got to pay for !
And do n't mean to - if I can help it .
Idiotic thing to go and put clocks on stockings - [ muttering ] damned silly idiotic - -


Dolly .
Ah !
[ Goes to table , brings the hospital box and puts it in front of him . ]
Double fine this time .
[ 73 ]


Harry .
What for ?


Dolly .
Naughty swear word , and getting out of temper .


Harry .
Oh well - [ fumbling in his pocket ] I did say d - - , but I did n't get out of temper !


Dolly .
You did n't get out of temper ?!?


Harry .
Not at all .
I 'm quite calm .
[ Sulkily puts a shilling in the box . ]
There !
[ Seats himself at table . ]
Now we 'll go quietly and methodically through the remainder - - [ Taking up a bill , looks at it , exclaims . ]
Good heavens !


Dolly .
Good heavens what ?


Harry .
[ In a low exhausted tone with groans . ]
Good heavens !
Good heavens !
It 's absolutely useless - Good heavens !


Dolly .
But what is it ?
[ Coming up , looking over .


Harry .
[ Points to bill . ]
Four more hats !
Nine on the other bill - four more here .
Thirteen hats .


Dolly .
No , one was a toque .


Harry .
But can you explain ?


Dolly .
Yes .
You said yourself that Madame Récamier was horribly expensive , so I left her and went to Jacquelin 's - just to save your pocket - -


Harry .
Never save my pocket again , please .


Dolly .
Very well , I wo n't .


Harry .
No , I daresay you wo n't , but I shall !
I shall draw the strings very tightly in future .
Save my pocket !
[ He is walking about distractedly . ]
Save my pocket .
[ Groans .


Dolly .
Now , Harry , it 's useless to take it in this way - you knew when you married me I had n't got the money sense - -


Harry .
[ Groans . ]
I had n't got any sense at all !


Dolly .
Very likely not .
But try and have a little now .
What have I done ?
Run a little into debt , solely to please you .
[ 74 ]


Harry .
Yes  well , now run out of it , and I shall be better pleased still .


Dolly .
After all , running into debt is a positive virtue beside the things that some wives do !


Harry .
Oh , it 's a positive virtue , is it ?


Dolly .
A husband is very lucky when his wife spends most of her time running up a few bills .
It keeps her out of mischief .
I 'm sure you ought to feel very glad that I 'm a little extravagant !


Harry .
Oh , I am !
I am !
I 'm delighted !


[ He sits at table , takes out a pencil , hurriedly puts down the amounts of the various bills - she creeps up behind him .


Dolly .
What are you doing ?


Harry .
I 'm totting up to see how lucky I am !
Forty-one , one , six - - [ Groans . ]
Ninety-four - - [ Groans .


Dolly .
[ Has crept up behind him , puts her arms round his neck . ]
Now , Harry , will you take my advice - - ?


Harry .
No .


Dolly .
It 's past eleven .


[ Trying to take the pencil out of his hand .


Harry .
[ Disengaging her arms , speaking very sternly . ]
Will you have the goodness to let me have all your bills , so that I may know what help I shall need from my banker ?


Dolly .
Harry , you do n't mean that ?
Oh , that 's absurd with our income !


Harry .
Will you have the goodness to do as I say , and at once , please ?
[ He is dotting down figures .
She stands still in the middle of the room . ]
Did you hear me ?


[ 75 ]


[ She bursts into tears .
He turns round and shows symptoms of relenting towards her , but steels himself and turns to the bills .
She bursts into renewed tears .
He goes on figuring .


Dolly .
[ Piteously . ]
Harry !
Harry !
[ Goes up to him and plucks his sleeve . ]
Harry !


Harry .
Well ?


[ He turns and looks at her , is about to yield , but resists , turns away from her , settles resolutely to his figures .


Dolly .
And on the first night of the New Year , too !
Just as we were going to be so happy !
Harry !
[ Holds out her arms appealingly . ]
Harry !
[ Harry suddenly turns round and clasps her . ]
How could you be so unkind to me ?


Harry .
Was I ?
I did n't mean to be .
Now !
Dry your tears , and help me reckon this up - -


Dolly .
Ye-es .


Harry .
But first of all let me have the remainder of the bills - -


Dolly .
Yes .


Harry .
At once , my darling - it 's getting late .


Dolly .
Yes .
[ Goes up to desk . ]
You wo n't reproach me ?


Harry .
Of course I wo n't .


Dolly .
I can bear anything except your reproaches .
Promise you wo n't reproach me .


Harry .
I wo n't , unless - -


Dolly .
Unless what ?


Harry .
It 's something too awful .


Dolly .
Oh , it is n't .
Not at all .
Not at all .
[ Goes up to the desk , brings down about ten more bills with great affected cheerfulness . ]
There !
You see , it 's nothing .


Harry .
[ Hastily looking at the totals . ]
Nothing ?
You call these nothing !!? [ 76 ]


Dolly .
Nothing to speak about - nothing awful !


Harry .
Good heavens !
How any woman with the least care for her husband , or her home - - [ looking at one total after another ] how any woman with the least self-respect - - [ Dolly goes to him , puts her arms round him , tries to embrace - he repulses her . ]
No , please .
I 've had enough of that old dodge .


Dolly .
Dodge !


Harry .
I remember that last two hundred pounds and how you sweedled me out of it !


Dolly .
Sweedled ?


Harry .
Yes !
Sweedled !


Dolly .
There 's no such word !


Harry .
No , but there 's the thing !
As most husbands know .
[ Referring to one bill after another , picking out items . ]
Lace coat , hand-made !
En-tout-cas , studded cabochons of lapis lazuli - studded cabochons - studded cabochons !


Dolly .
[ Has quietly seated herself , and is looking at the ceiling . ]
Could n't you manage to pitch your voice in rather a softer key ?


Harry .
[ Comes angrily down to her , bills in hand , speaks in a whisper , very rapidly and fiercely . ]
Yes !
And I say that a woman who goes and runs up bills like these , [ dashing the back of one hand against the bills in the other ] while her husband is smoking threepenny cigars , will very soon bring herself and him to one of those new palatial workhouses where , thank heaven , the cuisine and appointments are now organized with a view of providing persons of your tastes with every luxury at the ratepayers ' expense .
[ Returns angrily to the bills , turns them over . ]
Irish lace bolero !
[ Turns to another . ]
Fur motor coat , fifty-five guineas - -


Dolly .
[ Calmly gazing at the ceiling . ]
You told me to look as smart as Mrs. Colefield .
[ 77 ]


Harry .
Not at that price !
If I 'd known what that motor tour would cost by Jove !
I 'd - -


Dolly .
You 're getting noisy again .
You 'll wake my father .


Harry .
He ought to be waked !
He ought to know what his daughter is saddling me with .


Dolly .
Very well , if you do n't care how shabby I look - -


Harry .
Shabby !
[ Referring to bills . ]
Lace demi-toilette !
Point de Venise lace Directoire coat !
Shabby ?


Dolly .
My dear Harry , do you suppose we shall ever agree as to what constitutes shabbiness ?


Harry .
No , I 'm hanged if we ever shall !


Dolly .
Then suppose we drop the subject .
For the future I shall endeavor to please you entirely .


Harry .
Oh , you will ?


Dolly .
By dressing so that you 'll be ashamed to be seen in the same street with me .
I shall make myself a perfect fright - a perfect dowdy - a perfect draggletail !


Harry .
Then I shall not be seen in the same street with you .


Dolly .
You wo n't ?


Harry .
No , my dear .
Make no mistake about that !


Dolly .
You 'll be seen with somebody else , perhaps ?


Harry .
Very likely .


Dolly .
Have you met Miss Smithson again ?


Harry .
Not since the last time .


Dolly .
Have you seen her since we were at Folkestone ?


Harry .
What 's that to do with your bills ?


Dolly .
A great deal .
That night at dinner she told you her dress allowance was a hundred and twenty a year , and you said you wished she 'd give me a few lessons in economy .
[ 78 ]


Harry .
I did not .


Dolly .
Pardon me , you did !


Harry .
Pardon me , I did not .
I said she might give some women a lesson in economy .


Dolly .
You did not !
I heard every word of your conversation , and you distinctly asked her to give me , your wife , a few lessons in economy .


Harry .
I 'll swear I did n't !


Dolly .
Ask my father !
He was there .


Harry .
Very well !
I 'll ask him the first thing in the morning .


Dolly .
No , to-night !
You 've accused me of deliberately saying what is n't true , and I - -


Harry .
I have not !


Dolly .
Yes , you have .
And I insist on having it cleared up to-night !
I do n't suppose he 's asleep !
Fetch him down !


Harry .
Very well !
I will fetch him down !
[ Exit .


Dolly .
[ Paces furiously up and down . ]
Me !
Lessons in economy !
Lessons in economy !
Me !
Lessons in economy !


Re-enter Harry .
Harry .
He 'll be down in a minute !
Meantime , [ very angry ] I want to know what any woman in this world wants with two dozen cache corsets ?


[ Banging his free hand on the bills .


Dolly .
We 'll clear up Miss Smithson first - -


Harry .
No , we will not clear up Miss Smithson - -


Dolly .
Because you ca n't clear up Miss Smithson - -


Harry .
I can clear up Miss Smithson - -


Dolly .
You can not clear up Miss Smithson - -


Matt appears at door in dressing-gown , rubbing his eyes and looking very sleepy .
Dad , you remember Miss Smithson - [ 79 ] -


Matt .
[ Coming in , very sleepy . ]
Smithson ?


Dolly .
The girl at the hotel at Folkestone , that Harry paid so much attention to .


Harry .
I paid no more attention to Miss Smithson than was absolutely necessary .
Did I , Mr. Barron ?


Dolly .
Oh !
Oh !
Dad , you remember - -


Matt .
Not for the moment - -


Dolly .
Not the disgraceful way Harry - there 's no other word - carried on !


Harry .
I did not carry on - Mr. Barron , I appeal to you .


Dolly .
Dad !


Matt .
My dear , I certainly did not notice - -


Dolly .
No , he was far too careful to let anyone notice it , except his own wife !


Harry .
You lay your life when I do carry on my wife will be the last person I shall allow to notice it !


Dolly .
I daresay !
Dad , did you hear that ?


Matt .
Yes .
[ Rousing himself a little . ]
Now , Harry , what about this Miss Smithson ?


Harry .
That 's what I want to know !


Matt .
Who is Miss Smithson ?


Dolly .
Surely you remember that lanky girl - -


Harry .
Miss Smithson is not lanky - -


Dolly .
Not lanky ?
Not lanky ?!
You ca n't have any eyes - - !


Harry .
That 's what I 've often thought - -


Dolly .
[ Explodes . ]
Oh !
Oh !
Dad !


Matt .
Come , Harry , let 's clear this up .
[ Suddenly . ]
Smithson ?
Oh yes !
The girl who sat on your left at your dinner party - -


Dolly .
That 's the one !


Matt .
I should call her a trifle lanky , Harry .


Dolly .
A trifle ?
Well , never mind !
You remember that dinner party - -


Matt .
[ Cautiously . ]
Ye-es .
[ 80 ]


Dolly .
You remember how she waited for a lull in the talk , and then she said with that silly , simpering , appealing look - -


Harry .
Miss Smithson 's look is not silly or simpering .


Dolly .
Well , it 's appealing , is n't it ?


Harry .
[ With a little chuckle . ]
Oh , yes , it 's appealing .


Dolly .
[ Enraged . ]
Oh !
Dad !


Matt .
[ Quiets her . ]
Shush !
- What did she say ?


Dolly .
She said with a very marked glance at me , `` My dress allowance is a hundred and twenty a year , and I do n't understand how any reasonable woman can wish for more ! ''
What do you think of that ?


Matt .
Well , if she did say that , and if she glanced at you , it - -


Dolly .
Yes ?


Matt .
It was n't very nice of her .


Dolly .
Nice ?
It was an insult !
A direct , intentional , abominable insult , was n't it ?


Matt .
Yes , yes , decidedly , under the circumstances - -


Dolly .
And Harry ought to have resented it ?


Matt .
At his own dinner table he could n't , could he ?


Dolly .
Yes !
At least , if he could n't resent it , he ought to have shown that he resented it .
Instead of that , he actually asked her to give me a few lessons in economy !


Harry .
I did not !


Dolly .
Pardon me , you did !
Me !
his wife !
Lessons in economy !


Harry .
And a thundering good thing if she had given you a few before you ran up these bills !


[ Dashes his hand on to the bills .


Dolly .
There !
You hear ?!
[ 81 ]


Matt .
Come , Harry , you ought n't to have asked another woman to give your wife lessons in economy .


Harry .
I did n't !


Dolly .
Dad !
You were there - -


Matt .
Yes , but I do n't quite remember - -


Dolly .
You do n't remember ?!
Surely you can remember a simple thing like that when your own daughter tells you it was so !


Matt .
Now , Harry , what did you really say to Miss Smithson ?


Harry .
I said she might give some women a lesson in economy .


Matt .
Not meaning Dolly ?


[ Giving him a wink to say `` No . ''


Harry .
No-o .


Dolly .
Then whom did he mean ?
Lessons in economy ?
Whom could he mean if he did n't mean me ?


Harry .
Just so !


Dolly .
Ah !
There !
You see , he owns it !


Matt .
No , no , I 'm sure he does n't mean it !
Did you , Harry ?


[ Winking at Harry .


Dolly .
Then will he please say what he really does mean ?


Matt .
Now , Harry , what do you really mean ?


Harry .
Well , you remember that night of the dinner party at Folkestone .


Matt .
[ Cautiously . ]
Ye-es .


Harry .
After they 'd all gone you and I went into the smoking-room , did n't we ?


Matt .
[ Cautiously . ]
Ye-es .


Harry .
And you said , `` Doll 's in one of her high gales again ! ''


Dolly .
High gales ?!
[ Indignant . ]
Father !
You did n't say that ?


Matt .
No , no , my dear - [ 82 ] -


Harry .
Excuse me , those were your exact words .
High gales !


Matt .
I do n't remember .


Dolly .
No , you do n't remember anything .


Harry .
You said , `` What on earth was up between her and Miss Smithson at dinner ? ''


Dolly .
You see !
That proves exactly what I said !


Harry .
No , by Jove , it proves that your father noticed what a confounded , cussed - -


Dolly .
Go on !
Go on !
Say it !


Matt .
Shush !
Shush !
Well , Harry , what did you say ?


Harry .
Well , not wishing to give Dolly away - -


Dolly .
Ha !
ha !
Not wishing to give me away !


Harry .
Not then !
But , by Jove , if any decent chap were to come along now - -


Dolly .
[ Exploding . ]
There !
There !
[ To Matt . ]
And you sit there and hear my own husband insult me in my own house !


Matt .
No !
No !


Dolly .
But there you sit !
There you sit !


Matt .
[ Jumps up fiercely . ]
Now , Harry !


Harry .
[ Fiercely . ]
Well , now , Mr. Barron - -


Dolly .
Why do n't you defend me ?
Why do n't you demand an apology ?


Matt .
What for ?


Dolly .
For everything !
For to-night !
For that night at Folkestone !


Harry .
That night at Folkestone !
Why , your father was quite on my side - -


Matt .
What ?


Dolly .
He was n't  were you , Dad ?


Matt .
No - no .


Harry .
What ?
[ Fiercely . ]
Do you remember exactly what passed between us in the smoking-room , Mr. Barron ?
[ 83 ]


Matt .
No .


Harry .
Then I 'll tell you - -


Matt .
[ Retreating towards door . ]
No - no - I do n't want to know - -


Harry .
[ Following him up , shouting a little . ]
You said , `` I know what she 's like in her high gales !
I remember what the little devil was like at home . ''


Dolly .
[ Pursuing him up to door . ]
Father !
You did n't say that !


Matt .
No - no , my darling - quite a mistake - quite a mistake - altogether a mistake .


[ Gets thankfully off at back .


Dolly .
[ Calls after him . ]
Then why do n't you stay and tell him so !


Harry .
[ Shouts after Matt . ]
It 's not a mistake !


Dolly .
[ Calls after Matt . ]
It 's cowardly of you to leave me here to be insulted .


Harry .
[ Goes up to door , shouts . ]
It 's not a mistake !
You patted me on the back and said , `` Poor chap !
Poor chap ! ''
You know you did !
[ Closes the door , comes fiercely down to Dolly . ]
It 's not a mistake !
He could see you had insulted Miss Smithson .


Dolly .
I had not insulted her !
I was far too civil to her , considering that the next evening you took her out on the Leas , when you ought to have been at billiards - -


Harry .
I took her out on the Leas !


Dolly .
Yes !
You were n't in the billiard-room !
So where were you ?
Where were you ?


Harry .
I jolly well do n't know , and I - I - -


Dolly .
Say it !
Say it !


Harry .
I damned well do n't care !


Dolly .
Ah !


[ 84 ]


[ She seizes the box , brings it up to him , puts it irritatingly in front of him  he seizes it , they struggle for it , trying to take it out of each other 's hands  she screams , he tries to get it  there is a scuffle round the room  he tries to rub her knuckles  she makes a little feint to bite him  in the struggle the box drops on the floor a little below the table , right .


Dolly .
Jobling !
Jobling !
Jobling !


Harry .
Now , madam , for the last time , have I all your bills ?


Dolly .
Jobling !
Jobling !
Jobling !


Harry .
Have I all your bills ?


Dolly .
Jobling !
Jobling !
Jobling !


Harry .
Once more , madam , have I all your bills ?


Dolly .
No , you have n't !


Harry .
Then please hand them over to me this instant , so that I may take proceedings .


Dolly .
[ Laughing . ]
Proceedings !
Ha !
Take your proceedings !


Harry .
By Jove !
I will take proceedings .


Dolly .
Take them !
Take them !


Harry .
[ Walking about furiously with the bills . ]
So this is the way the money goes !
[ Banging the bills . ]
While I have to smoke twopenny cigars !
And ca n't get a decent dinner !


Dolly .
You ca n't get a decent dinner ?


Harry .
No !
Look at those messes last night .
They were n't fit for a cook-shop .


Dolly .
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
Get a housekeeper !
Get a housekeeper !


Harry .
By Jove !
that 's what I mean to do !


Dolly .
Have Miss Smithson !
Send for her to-morrow morning !
I 'll hand her over the keys !


Harry .
[ Shouting . ]
And please hand me over the rest of your bills !
The rest of your bills , madam !


[ Dolly marches up to the desk .


[ 85 ]


Matt appears at door in dressing-gown .
Matt .
I ca n't get a wink of sleep - -


[ Dolly takes out about twenty more bills .


Harry .
I insist on seeing the whole lot !
So there !


Dolly .
[ Flourishing the bills , strewing them on the floor . ]
Well there !
And there !
And there !
And there !
Now you 've got the whole lot !
And I hope you 're satisfied .
I 'm going into Renie 's room !
[ Exit .


Harry .
I insist on your going through these bills - -


[ Following her off .
Their voices are heard retreating upstairs , Dolly saying , `` go through the bills !
Send for Miss Smithson !
Have her here to-morrow morning !
Take your proceedings , '' Harry saying , `` I insist on going through the bills to-night !
Do you hear , madam , I insist !
Will you come down and go through these bills , '' etc. .


Matt .
[ Listens , as their voices die away .
When the voices have ceased , he surveys the scene . ]
We 're making a splendid start for the New Year !


[ Sees the box on the floor , picks it up , carefully places it on table and goes off .


CURTAIN .


[ 86 ]


( A year passes between Acts III and IV . )


ACT IV .


Scene : The same .


Time : Afternoon of January 1st , 1908 .


Enter Lucas , followed by Criddle .
Lucas has his left collar-bone broken , and his arm is strapped across his breast  his coat is buttoned loosely over the arm , the left sleeve hanging down .


Lucas .
They 've gone to meet me ?


Criddle .
Yes , sir .


Lucas .
By the road ?


Criddle .
Yes , sir .


Lucas .
That 's how I 've missed them .
My car broke down the other side of the clump , and so I walked over the fields .


Criddle .
Yes , sir .
I beg pardon , I hope the arm is n't serious .


Lucas .
No , Criddle .
Just serious enough to get me a couple of months ' leave , so that I could spend the New Year in England .


Criddle .
You had it very hot in India , I suppose , sir ?


Lucas .
Blazing !


Criddle .
We 've got the same old weather here , you see , sir .


Lucas .
Same old weather !
Had any visitors for Christmas , Criddle ?


Criddle .
Mr. Barron , of course , and Professor and Mrs. Sturgess .


Lucas .
Same old visitors - same visitors , I should say .
Mr. Pilcher still Vicar here , I suppose ?


Criddle .
Yes , sir .
He gave us a wonderful sermon at the old year 's service last night .
[ 87 ]


Lucas .
Same old sermon !


Criddle .
No , sir .
Not exactly the same sermon , though it had similar points to last year .
Ah !
You came over for the old year 's service last year ?


Lucas .
Yes , and a rattling good sermon it was !


Criddle .
Very powerful and persuading , was n't it , sir ?
It even touched me up a bit .


Lucas .
In what way , Criddle ?


Criddle .
I used to have my ten bob on any horse as I fancied , but I never put a farthing on anything - not even on Sulky Susan for the Oaks .


Lucas .
You did n't ?


Criddle .
No , and thank God , in a manner of speaking , that I did n't , for she never pulled it off .
I owe that to Mr. Pilcher .
No , I never touched a thing till the Leger .
That reminds me - -


Lucas .
What , Criddle ?


Criddle .
Why , last year , after Mr. Pilcher 's sermon , the master had a collecting box , and when he found himself going a bit off the straight he used to put in a shilling or half-a-crown for Mr. Pilcher 's blanket fund - -


Lucas .
Yes , of course !
And Uncle Matt promised him a sovereign for each of us if we had carried out our good resolutions .
Is that coming off , Criddle ?


Criddle .
I expect it is , sir .
Mr. Pilcher is coming here this afternoon , and the master told me to be sure and find the box before he gets here .


Lucas .
Find the box ?


Criddle .
Nobody has seen anything of it for some months .
Excuse me , sir , I must look for it .


[ 88 ]


[ Exit Criddle .


Lucas takes out letter from an unsealed envelope , glances through it , sits at table , takes out pencil , adds a short note , puts letter in envelope , seals it up , puts it in his tail pocket , goes to conservatory , looks in .
Renie enters at door behind him .
She starts , as he turns round .


Renie .
[ In a whisper . ]
You 're here already ?


Lucas .
Yes - -


Renie .
Your wound ?


Lucas .
Much better .
Nearly well .


Renie .
I 'm so glad - -


Lucas .
I 'm not .
I shall have to cut it back to India directly .
Why did n't you answer my last letter ?


Renie .
I did - and tore it up .


Lucas .
Tore it up ?


Renie .
What 's the use ?
I told you last year we could never be anything to each other !


Lucas .
But you did n't mean it ?


[ He seizes her hand and kisses it several times .


Renie .
[ Feebly attempting to withdraw it . ]
Yes - yes , I did .
Hush !


Lucas .
I want you to read this .
[ Shows her the letter .


Matt .
[ Heard through the door which is open a few inches . ]
Have you found the box , Criddle ?


Criddle .
No , sir .
I 've hunted everywhere .


Matt .
Have another look .
We must have it ready for Mr. Pilcher .


Matt enters .
Meantime Renie has crept to upper conservatory door and gone off signing to Lucas to keep silence .
He has taken the letter out of his pocket and held it up for her to see , putting it back before Matt enters .


Matt .
Ah , Lucas .
So you 've got here .
Happy New Year !


Lucas .
Happy New Year , Uncle Matt .
[ Cordially shaking hands .


Matt .
Glad to see you back in England .


Lucas .
Glad to be back !


Matt .
How 's the arm ?
[ 89 ]


Lucas .
Splendid - nearly well .
Dolly and Harry all right ?


Matt .
First rate .
They 'll be here directly .


Lucas .
The Sturgesses are here again , Criddle tells me .


Matt .
Ye-es .


Lucas .
Gray matter still going strong ?


Matt .
Booming .


Lucas .
How 's Mrs. Sturgess ?


Matt .
As usual , a little inclined to flop about and play act - -


Lucas .
Yes .
Jolly good-looking woman though , eh ?


Matt .
Very .
Lucas - -


Lucas .
Well ?


Matt .
You 're quite cured , eh ?


Lucas .
Cured ?


Matt .
Of your infatuation for her .


Lucas .
Infatuation ?
Well , I admired her , and perhaps it was lucky I was ordered out to India - -


Matt .
I managed that for you , my boy .


Lucas .
You did !?


Matt .
Sir John wanted a smart A.D.C. , so I drove over to Aldershot , urged your claims , and got you the appointment .


Lucas .
So that was why I was packed off .
It was you who - -


Matt .
Are n't you thankful I did ?


Lucas .
Yes , much obliged to you , much obliged !


Matt .
So you ought to be .
And so 's the lady .


Lucas .
Is she ?


Matt .
Yes .
When we got your wire yesterday saying you 'd motor down to-day , Dolly had a long talk with her , and the result was she thanked Dolly and me for getting you out of the way and saving her from you .
[ 90 ]


Lucas .
Did she ?


Matt .
Yes , for twenty minutes .
She kissed Dolly , and I think she would have kissed me , only I did n't feel myself quite worthy .


Lucas .
Oh , so that 's all settled !


Matt .
That 's all settled .
At least , let 's hope so .


Lucas .
What do you mean ?


Matt .
Well , you wo n't come - -


Lucas .
What ?


Matt .
The same old game .


Lucas .
What same old game ?


Matt .
Why , the same old game !


Lucas .
You must be judging me by yourself , when you were young .


Matt .
My dear boy , that 's just what I am doing .
Lucas , there 's not going to be any repetition - -


Lucas .
No - no .


Matt .
Because it is n't the right thing to do , is it ?


Lucas .
No .


Matt .
Very well then , do n't do it !


Lucas .
I wo n't !
[ Listening . ]
Ah !
[ Dolly and Harry 's voices heard in hall ] Dolly and Harry !


Dolly and Harry enter very lovingly .


Lucas .
Hillo , Doll , old girl !
Happy New Year !


Dolly .
Happy New Year , Lu !


Lucas .
Harry , old brick , how goes it ?


Harry .
Splendid !


Lucas .
Happy New Year !


Harry .
Happy New Year !
[ Looking lovingly at Dolly . ]
By Jove , Doll , you can foot it .
[ To Lucas . ]
Doll and I have just raced up from the farm .
She licked me !
bless her !


Dolly .
Yes , because you encouraged me !


Harry .
[ Looking at her lovingly and admiringly , kisses her heartily . ]
There are n't many things this little woman ca n't do .
[ 91 ]


Dolly .
When you encourage me !


Harry .
Oh , I 'll encourage you !


[ He again kisses her heartily .


Harry .
Well , Lu , old boy , glad to see you home again .
Arm pretty bad ?


Lucas .
No , nearly well , unfortunately .


Dolly .
Down for the day ?


Lucas .
Well , now my car has broken down , I was wondering if you 'd put me up - -


Dolly .
[ Firmly . ]
No .
We shall be pleased for you to stay to dinner .


Harry .
There 's the spare room , Doll .


Dolly .
[ Firmly . ]
No .
That may be wanted for Renie or myself .


Harry .
[ Half aside to her . ]
I say , not for you , old girl !


Lucas .
Oh , well , I shall have to get a shake-down at the Red Lion .


Enter Renie at back , still in outdoor clothes .
Renie .
[ Feigning a little surprise . ]
Captain Wentworth !
A happy New Year !


Lucas .
Happy New Year , Mrs. Sturgess .


[ Shaking hands .


Renie .
So sorry to hear of your wound !


Lucas .
Oh , it 's healed , thank you .


Renie .
I 'm so glad .
Shall you be making a long stay in England ?


Lucas .
I fear only a few days longer .


Renie .
I 'm sorry your visit will be so short .


Criddle enters triumphantly with the hospital box which is very mouldy and dusty - he has also duster in his hand .
Criddle .
I 've found him , sir -


Matt .
Rather mouldy , eh ?
[ 92 ]


Criddle .
Oh , we 'll soon put that to rights , sir .


[ Begins to dust the box carefully .


Matt .
Looks well for your household discipline here , Harry .


Harry .
How ?


Matt .
You 've had no occasion to use him lately .


Criddle .
[ Displaying the box , having carefully dusted it . ]
There he is , sir , Hospital for Incurables !
Nearly as good as new .


Matt .
Where did you find him ?


Criddle .
In the wine-cellar , of all places !
I was getting out a bottle of the sixty-eight port for New Year 's night , and happening to put my hand behind , there he was !


Harry .
[ Has a sudden gesture of remembrance . ]
Yes , I remember !


Matt .
What should incurables be doing in the wine-cellar ?
[ Holds out his hand to Criddle for the box .
Criddle , who has been holding it carefully , gives it to Matt .
Exit Criddle .
Matt gives the box a shake .
It rattles as if half full of coins .
He shakes it again , more violently  it rattles again . ]
Internal organs sound healthy .
How did he get into the wine-cellar , Harry ?


Harry .
Well , Dolly and I had been having a little tiff one morning - nothing serious - -


Matt .
No .
When was that ?


Harry .
March , was n't it ?


Dolly .
May , I think - -


Harry .
No , it was n't that one - Well , never mind , I got so riled at Dolly always poking this box in front of me whenever I happened to - so I thought the wine-cellar would be the safest place for it .


Matt .
[ Gives it another rattle . ]
Well , here he is , turned up just at the right moment !
And here you all are , Dolly , Harry , Lucas , Mrs. Sturgess - all [ 93 ] clamouring for me to redeem my promise and put in a sovereign for each of you .


Criddle appears at door announcing Mr. Pilcher .
Pilcher enters with four oblong brown paper parcels of equal size .
Exit Criddle .
Pilcher .
Happy New Year to you all !
Excuse me .
[ Depositing his parcels . ]
My New Year 's gifts to a few of my parishioners !


Dolly .
New Year 's gifts !


Pilcher .
To those who need them .
[ Shaking hands with her . ]
Happy New Year , Mr. Barron !


[ Shaking hands .


Matt .
Happy New Year !


Pilcher .
How do this morning , Telfer !
[ Harry nods . ]
My dear Mrs. Sturgess !
[ Shaking hands .


Renie .
Happy New Year !
What a lovely sermon you gave us again last night !


Pilcher .
Lovely !
Well , say healthy , bracing .


Harry .
A jolly good rouser again .
Made me feel - well - -


[ Gives himself a shake .


Pilcher .
Ah , Captain Wentworth , happy New Year !


Lucas .
[ Shaking hands . ]
Happy New Year !


Pilcher .
I heard you were wounded - -


Lucas .
Oh , that 's done with .


Matt .
We were just talking about our New Year 's inquest - -


Pilcher .
Inquest ?!


Matt .
Into the characters of Dolly and Harry and - -


[ Glancing at Renie and Lucas .


Dolly .
Oh , please do n't talk about inquests .
Nobody 's character is dead here .


Matt .
I hope not !
We shall see - -


Lucas .
Uncle , you do n't really mean - -


Matt .
It was a bona fide bargain on my side , but if you wish to avoid any awkward little exposures , or [ 94 ] if Mr. Pilcher will kindly waive his claims to my contributions - -


Pilcher .
I 'm afraid I ca n't .
I have come here for the express purpose of bearing away my trophy - Ah !
[ Seeing box on table , takes it , gives it a shake  his features assume a pleasant smile . ]
It seems to have proved a very wholesome household regulator .


Harry .
Yes , by Jove !
It had n't been in the house twenty-four hours before I put in a sovereign .


Pilcher .
A sovereign ?


Harry .
The first night of last year Dolly and I had a little tiff - nothing serious - and so the next morning I made it up and - did n't I , Dolly ?
- -


Dolly .
You did !
And paid my bills like a lamb , you dear !


Pilcher .
And put in a sovereign ?
[ Rattles the box again . ]
I wo n't say `` Do n't have any more household tiffs , '' but I will say `` Do n't omit to liquidate them . ''
[ Gives the box another rattle . ]
The box must have been in pretty constant use since - -


Harry .
Ye-es .


Professor Sturgess enters at back , with the proofs of his book in his hand .
Prof. How do you do ?


Pilcher .
[ Has put down box . ]
How do you do ?
[ Shaking hands . ]
Happy New Year !


Prof. Happy New Year to you !
[ To Lucas . ]
How d' ye do ?


Lucas .
First rate .
Happy New Year !


[ Shaking hands .


Prof. Thank you .
An accident ?


Lucas .
Bit of one .
Getting over it .


Prof. If I might recommend the constant use of Pableine .


Lucas .
Oh , thanks , it 's quite well - [ 95 ] -


Prof. Try Pableine .
It 's a wonderful restorative .
I 'm intruding - -


[ Looking round .


Pilcher .
Not at all .
We were just about to settle the question Mr. Barron raised last New Year 's day - -


Prof. Oh , yes  I remember !
Curiously enough I have only this morning received the proofs of my new volume , `` Free Will , the Illusion . ''


[ Showing the proofs to Pilcher .


Pilcher .
Very interesting .
I should like to discuss the matter with you , but [ taking out watch ] I have so many New Year 's calls to make .
[ Looking at Matt . ]
Perhaps we ought to get on with the - a - -


Matt .
Inquest .


Pilcher .
Vindication .


Matt .
[ Accepting the correction . ]
Vindication .


Prof. I may perhaps be allowed to point out that Mr. Barron 's novel and humorous experiment can in no sense be said to settle , or even to touch , the question of Free Will , which as I have proved here depends upon - - [ Again offering the proof .


Pilcher .
I should like to look through those sheets , but - -


[ Glancing at Matt .


Prof. You shall !
I have put the whole argument into the concrete case of Sarah Mumford - -


Pilcher .
Sarah Mumford ?


Prof. The baby farmer - -


Matt .
Sarah 's gray matter gone watery ?


Prof. Not watery , but she had a yellow effusion - -


Matt .
I suppose that 's just as bad ?


Prof. Quite .


Matt .
What did they do with her ?


Prof. They hanged her .
They then discovered extensive lesions and this yellow effusion - -


Matt .
Pity they did n't discover that before they hanged her .
[ 96 ]


Prof. My exact point !
Where is the justice of punishing a woman whose gray matter functions perversely ?
It is nothing short of a crime .


Dolly .
But she had suffocated five dear little babies ?


Matt .
How could she avoid suffocating babies if she had a yellow effusion in her brain ?


Prof. Precisely my argument - -


[ Puts his proofs into Matt 's hands .
Points out a passage .
Matt , a little embarrassed , takes them , looks through them . ]


Prof. The point I wish to establish is this .
While we all allow that extensive or recognizable diseases of , or injuries to , the brain , free a man from responsibility and punishment , how can we logically mete out blame or praise , punishment or reward to our ordinary acts , thoughts , and impulses , seeing that all our acts , thoughts , and impulses , good or bad , virtuous or criminal , are equally the mere expressions of certain inevitable physical changes in the brain , the mere register on the dial plate of consciousness of necessary predetermined complications in the working of certain atoms of the gray matter of our cortex ?


Matt .
Quite so !
Quite so !
[ Dolly is about to speak , but Matt hushes her down with a warning look and sign . ]
The Professor wants to say with Socrates that no man would be such a fool as to do wrong , if he could possibly help it .


Prof. Well , if you like to put it that way - -


Pilcher .
And now perhaps we might proceed .
Can you remember the exact terms , Mr. Barron ?


Matt .
I am to pay a sovereign for everyone of your hearers who has so far benefited by the wise admonitions of your last year 's sermon as to have broken off his bad habits , or some especial bad habit - -


Lucas .
We are n't bound to say what the habit is that we 've broken off ?
[ 97 ]


Matt .
I do n't wish to be inquisitive , but if you do n't mention the particular bad habit , you will have to give me your word of honor that you 've conquered it .
[ Putting down proofs on table , taking up the money-box , giving it a shake . ]
Now , who will be first to step into the confessional ?
[ Looking round .


Dolly .
I will .
As I 've nothing to confess .


Matt .
Nothing ?


Dolly .
No .
I had what some husbands might think a bad habit , but - -


Harry .
No bills this Christmas , eh , Doll ?


Dolly .
No .


Harry .
You 're sure now , my darling ?


Dolly .
None of any importance .


Harry .
What do you mean of any importance ?


Dolly .
Well , you must have some bills - they grow up before you know - such as Doctors ' bills - you ca n't settle them all on the spur of the moment , but I 've nothing - nothing of importance .
So please put in your sovereign for me , Dad , and look pleasant about it .


Matt .
You declare upon your word of honor that you have broken off your bad habit of running up bills ?


Dolly .
Yes .


Matt .
Entirely ?


Dolly .
Yes .
You said you would n't be inquisitive .


Matt .
Yes , but - -


Pilcher .
Mrs. Telfer has given her word .
I think I may claim one victory for free will , [ nodding victoriously at the Professor who shakes his head ] , and one sovereign for the Blanket Club .


Matt .
Hum !
[ Draws a sovereign out of his pocket and very reluctantly drops it into the box , shakes his head at Dolly who looks a little uncomfortable . ]
Who volunteers next ?


Renie .
I do .
No - I 'll wait a little - I want to make [ 98 ] sure that I am perfectly honest with myself and with everybody .


Matt .
That perhaps may need a little consideration , Lucas ?


Lucas .
Oh , let Harry have his doing first !


Matt .
Now , Harry !


Harry .
Oh , well , here goes !
I 'm going to make a clean breast .
The fact is I 've made a thundering mess of it .


Matt .
Ah !


Harry .
I did begin all right except for a little tiff with Dolly - and then I kept on pretty well for some time , and then - well I do n't know - I seemed to go all to pieces and - [ Matt rattles the money-box . ]
However , better luck this year .


Pilcher .
Shall we say a little more resolution ?


Harry .
Oh , I mean to pull myself together this year .


Matt .
Perhaps you tried too much reforming , Harry - too many irons in the fire , eh ?


Harry .
Well , it 's jolly hard to keep it up .
And I 'd got pretty slack till you woke us up last night - I say , that was a rouser again .


Pilcher .
It was n't a very bad sermon , was it ?
Well now for the next year shall we make one especial effort in one especial direction - Say - -


Dolly .
Temper , eh , Harry ?


Harry .
Right , old girl !
Oh , I mean it .


Matt .
No victory for free will , and the Blanket Club , this time .
Game and game , eh ?
Now which of you two - -


[ Looking at Renie and Lucas .


Renie .
I 'll be your first victim .
[ Coming into the middle of the room , and posing . ]
It 's so strange that what you started as a jest - -


Matt .
Oh no , in deadly earnest I assure you .


Renie .
In this life who knows what is jest and what [ 99 ] is earnest ?
The least little innocent thing may turn to a tragedy in a moment - -


Matt .
Surely you have n't had any little tragedies ?


Renie .
No , last year a mere little circumstance might have turned to a tragedy - honestly I was n't to blame , but perhaps I was a little careless , and two dear friends came to me with their counsel , and what might have been a tragedy was turned to a comedy , thanks to those two dear friends !


Prof. My dear , may I ask `` what circumstance '' you are alluding to ?


Matt .
We said we would n't be inquisitive - -


Prof. No , but I can not recall anything in my wife 's life during the last twelve months that even approached a tragedy - -


Renie .
I said the affair was quite unimportant - -


Prof. Then I wish , my dear , you would n't magnify everything , and I wish you would read solid scientific works in place of rubbishy French novels - and above all , take a little more regular exercise !


Matt .
Perhaps Mrs. Sturgess may consider that little point during the coming year .
Meantime , [ To Renie ] may we be confident your little tragedy is ended - -


Renie .
Oh yes , quite .


Matt .
We need n't ask its nature , but you give us your word of honor ?


[ Looks at her very searchingly and speaking seriously . ]


Renie .
Yes , my word of honor .


Matt .
Thank you .


Pilcher .
Another victory .


Matt .
[ Looks searchingly at her , drops a sovereign in the box . ]
Lucas ?


Lucas .
[ Coming cheerfully forward . ]
My turn for the thumbscrew !


Matt .
You seem very cheerful about it .
[ 100 ]


Lucas .
Yes , I 'm going to make a jolly good show .


Matt .
What particular bad habit have you conquered during the past year ?


Lucas .
I do n't know that I 've conquered any one in particular , but I 've had a regular good go in all round , so altogether I can pat myself on the back .


Matt .
But I want to know one particular habit conquered - for instance , you were n't very careful what ladies you made love to , or how many of them at the same time - -


Lucas .
I say , Uncle Matt , drop this - -


Matt .
And a year or two ago you went just a little bit off the straight - -


Lucas .
Oh no I did n't .


Matt .
I want to know - -


Lucas .
Thank you , no more thumbscrew .
I 'm out of this before it goes any further .


Matt .
It is n't going any further .
[ Putting his hand on Lucas 's shoulder . ]
Give me your word of honor - -


Lucas .
That 's all very well , it was n't a very bad case , and I do n't think you should have brought it up .
But as you have - well , I did meet a lady , and I was very much attracted to her , but I summoned all my resolution , and there the matter ended .


Pilcher .
I think I may claim a victory here .


Lucas .
So please put in your sovereign .


Matt .
[ Very seriously . ]
If you will give me your word of honor that you have absolutely broken off - -


Lucas .
Yes , yes , of course I have .


[ Matt puts in a sovereign , hands the box to Pilcher .


Pilcher .
Three victories and one draw out of four .
Most satisfactory .
[ Taking out watch . ]
I must hurry off to the White House and see what they 're doing there .
[ Rattling the box . ]
Excellent results !
So [ 101 ] excellent that I think I 'm justified in making you a little New Year 's gift .


[ Going to his heap of brown-paper parcels .


Dolly .
A New Year 's gift !
How kind of you !
To me ?


Pilcher .
[ Opening his parcel . ]
To you and your husband .
To your husband in particular , because , although he may have fallen a little short of perfection during the last year - like some of the rest of us - yet I feel sure that during this coming year - [ They have all been watching him curiously  he has now opened the parcel and displays a very bright brand new collecting box , with Crookbury Blanket Club painted on it , in large letters .
It is much larger than the hospital box . ]
My household regulator !
[ Giving it to Dolly .


Dolly .
[ Who has shown considerable disappointment on the opening of the parcel . ]
Crookbury Blanket Club !
Thank you so much , for Harry 's sake .
Harry !
For you , dear .


[ She gives the box to Harry , who places it on the same table . ]


Dolly .
You call it the household regulator ?


Pilcher .
Yes - I have suggested it to several of my brethren .
Oh , its use will become very general throughout the diocese .


Dolly .
You think it will work well ?


Pilcher .
It can not fail .
A box of this character - larger or smaller , according to the size of the family and their behaviour is left at each house on the first of the year .
All little failings , peccadilloes , and asperities are strictly fined .
The inevitable result is that either the family behaviour improves , or the parish charities benefit .
I 'm starting its operation in my parish to-day .
Forgive any inexcusable rudeness in leaving the first box with you .
I must hurry off !
[ Shaking hands . ]
Good-bye , Professor .
[ 102 ]


Prof. I should like to make that point clear with regard to free will - -


Pilcher .
When you have an hour , or shall I say a year , to spare , we might argue it out - -


Prof. You 're going to the White House ?
If I might accompany you - -


Pilcher .
Delighted !


[ Shakes hands in dumb show with Dolly and Harry .


Prof. Renie , you 've had your restless fits again .
You 'd better come with us - -


Renie .
But I 've already been walking - -


Prof. My dear , this bracing country air is just what you need .
Keep out in it all the day long - -


Renie .
Oh , very well - the White House , and the fish-pond as usual , I suppose ?


Prof. As usual .
Come along .


[ Exit .
Renie slightly shrugs her shoulders , very slightly glances at Lucas and exit after Professor .


Lucas .
The dear old fish-pond !
We might all take a stroll there !


Matt .
Good idea !
The dear old fish-pond !
We might all take a stroll there !


[ Linking his arm with Lucas .


Lucas .
[ Suspicious , holding back . ]
I do n't know that I care - we went there last year - -


Matt .
We did !
Same old game , eh ?
Come along .


[ Drags Lucas off .


Pilcher .
[ Has been gathering up his parcels . ]
Well , good-bye !
Good-bye !
[ Rattles the hospital box vigorously . ]
Three splendid victories for free will and moral resolution !


[ Exit , rattling the box .


[ 103 ]


Harry .
Doll , you really have n't got any bills this year ?


Dolly .
No !
no !
Only the few little oddments that no woman can prevent .


Harry .
You might let me see the little oddments - -


Dolly .
I will .
[ Suddenly . ]
Oh Harry , I quite forgot !
Do forgive me !


Harry .
What ?


Dolly .
I never wrote the geyser bath people !


Harry .
Never mind the geyser bath .


Dolly .
And only this morning you rowed me because I had n't got it ready for the New Year !
Where did you put their address ?


Harry .
I do n't know !
Somewhere upstairs among my papers .


Dolly .
[ Gently pushing him off . ]
I can just catch to-night 's post !
Make haste and get it !
Quick !
There 's a dear !
And then we can get the bath fixed up for you next week .


Harry .
Ye - es .
I say , Doll , I mean to get those oddments fixed up to-night .


[ Taps the writing-case significantly and exit .
Dolly looks frightened , sees him off , goes up to writing-desk , takes out bills , looks at them , throws up her arms in despair , groans , slams down the writing-desk , looks at the chair she has touched in first act , shows great resolution , marches up and touches it .


Dolly .
Yes !
Yes !
I have got free will .


[ Goes back from it , again looks at it , again marches up to it , touches it .


Dolly .
Then why do I keep on having bills ?


Renie enters in great agitation and distress .
[ 104 ] Renie .
Oh , Dolly !


Dolly .
What 's the matter ?


Renie .
Oh , Dolly !


Dolly .
What is it ?


Renie .
[ Throws her arms round Dolly affectionately . ]
You 've always been such a true friend to me - -


Dolly .
Yes , dear .


Renie .
More like a sister .
And I know I may trust you now .


Dolly .
[ A little suspicious . ]
Yes .
Has anything happened ?


Renie .
Yes .
Oh , Dolly - -


Dolly .
Tell me !


Renie .
As we were going out at the garden gate , Captain Wentworth held out a letter behind his back for me to take - -


Dolly .
What ?!


Renie .
But now his arm is wounded he could n't manage it properly , and he dropped it .
I hurried to pick it up , and then my husband noticed and insisted on reading it - -


Dolly .
What was in the letter ?


Renie .
It was n't so very bad , but my husband has chosen to jump to a wrong conclusion , and - oh , Dolly , you can help me !


Dolly .
[ Coldly , relaxing her embrace . ]
How ?


Renie .
If you 'd only let me tell my husband that I was receiving it for you - -


Dolly .
What ?!


Renie .
There was no address , and fortunately it was so worded that it showed that you were n't really guilty .


Dolly .
Oh !
I was n't really guilty ?


Renie .
In fact , it proves your complete innocence .


Dolly .
I 'm glad of that .
[ 105 ]


Renie .
Then you 'll let me say it was you ?


Dolly .
No !
You ca n't suppose I should let my own cousin make love to me in my own house ?!


Renie .
You wo n't help me ?


Dolly .
Yes , any way but that !
How could you be so foolish ?


Renie .
I do n't know .
When I heard yesterday he was coming , I quite made up my mind I 'd have nothing to say to him !
Dolly , free will must be an illusion , or else why am I always doing the things I do n't mean to do .
Oh , what shall I do ?


Dolly .
As you are completely innocent , you 'd better ask your husband to forgive you .


Renie .
Ye - es .
No !
As it is a perfectly pure and exalted attachment I shall take that ground - at any rate at first , and see what he says .
You 'll help me all you can ?


Dolly .
Yes , but promise me you 'll have nothing to do with Lucas in future !


Renie .
No , indeed !
if I once get out of this .


Dolly .
Very well !
I 'll see what I can do .
- Hush !


The Professor enters with a letter in his hand , Matt soothing him .
Prof. [ Very angry . ]
Not a word more , if you please .
Mrs. Telfer , you have doubtless heard - -


Dolly .
Yes - - ?


Prof. I leave for London to-night-to consult my lawyer .
Mrs. Sturgess will , I trust , return to her friends until - -


Matt .
Perhaps Mrs. Sturgess may be able to explain - -


Prof. What explanation can be offered of language like this .
[ Reading from letter . ]
`` From the first moment I saw you , I felt that you were entirely different from any woman I have ever met - - '' A [ 106 ] monstrously inexact statement to start with .
And a woman who is capable of practising such deceit - -


[ Renie bursts into tears .


Matt .
I think you ought to hear what Mrs. Sturgess has to say - -


Renie .
[ Through her tears . ]
What would be the use ?
With such a nature as his he could never begin to understand the loyal and exalted devotion which Captain Wentworth feels for me !
No , all my life I have been misunderstood , misjudged , condemned !
Let it be so till the end !
Dolly , come and help me pack !


[ Exit .
Matt goes up to table and takes up proofs of Professor 's book and looks through them .


Dolly .
You 're really too severe with poor Renie - -


Prof. I am not severe .
I simply register the inevitable sentence of the husband upon the wife who misconducts herself !


Dolly .
Misconducts herself !
She has merely had a little harmless flirtation - -


Prof. In my wife a flirtation of this character [ pointing to letter in his hand ] constitutes grave misconduct .


Dolly .
But that 's perfectly ridiculous !
Why it might happen to any woman !
Dad , explain to him - -


Matt .
Professor , you 're taking altogether a wrong view of this .
Now this case you were pointing out to me in your own book [ pointing to proofs ] - Number forty-nine , Mrs. Copway .
Remarkably handsome woman too !
- [ reading ] `` The injustice and cruelty of condemning this poor lady must be apparent to all . ''
My dear Professor , before publishing this book you 'll have to modify your theory .


Prof. I can not modify my theory .
I have spent ten years in collecting facts which prove it .
[ 107 ]


Matt .
Then , pardon me , you must really look over Mrs. Sturgess 's little indiscretion .


Prof. That is equally impossible - -


Matt .
But you say that her action in receiving my nephew 's letter was entirely due to the activity of certain atoms in the gray matter of her brain .


Prof. Undoubtedly that is so .


Dolly .
Very well then , if her gray matter keeps on working wrong , what 's the use of blaming her ?
You say yourself there 's no such thing as free will - -


Prof. Precisely , but I have always allowed that in the present low moral and intellectual condition of the herd of mankind , free will is a plausible working hypothesis .


Dolly .
But it does n't work !
Free will wo n't work at all !
Look at my own case !
Do you suppose I should go on all my life having bills if I could help myself ?
[ Catching Matt 's eye , who looks at her gravely and holds up his finger . ]
Never mind my bills !
Do make him see how wrong and absurd it is to punish poor Renie when there 's no such thing as free will !


Matt .
Dolly 's right !
She 's only saying what you have so admirably laid down here .
My dear Professor , you can not possibly publish this book !


Prof. But it has been announced !
I must publish it .


Matt .
You can not .
Read that .
[ Giving the Professor the book and pointing out passage . ]
Surely after that you can not condemn Mrs. Sturgess .


Prof. [ Taking book , glancing at the passage . ]
Really , it 's most annoying when one 's own wife upsets - -


Matt .
Oh !
they 're always making hay of our theories one way or the other .


Prof. Of course , if one presses the matter home to first principles - -


Dolly .
Yes !
Yes !
Well , why not act on your own [ 108 ] first principles !
You ought to be very sorry for poor Renie , considering all she has suffered .


Prof. Suffered ?


Dolly .
Yes , poor dear !
You do n't know what an awful struggle she has gone through between this unfortunate flirtation and her admiration for you .


Prof. Her admiration for me !


Dolly .
Yes !
She always speaks of you as her great protagonist of science .


Prof. [ Mollified . ]
Does she ?
Does she ?


Dolly .
Yes .
If I were you I should go upstairs , and be very sweet to her , and above all do n't reproach her .
We women can endure anything except reproaches - -


Prof. [ Looking at his proofs . ]
I must publish my book .
And after all , as you say , it is useless to blame them for acting according to the - -


Matt .
The dictates of their gray matter when , bless them , they ca n't help themselves .
My dear Professor , instead of condemning your wife you ought to be condoling with her , and doing all you can to get her gray matter into a healthy condition .


Prof. I will hear what she has to say .


Dolly .
No .
Go straight to her and forgive her , and then I 'm sure her gray matter will soon be all right .
And what a triumph that will be for you !


Prof. It does offer a way out of the difficulty .
In any case I must publish my book .
[ Exit .


Dolly .
Dad , I wo n't have her here next Christmas .


Matt .
No , my dear , I would n't .


Dolly .
That wretched Lucas !


Matt .
What is to be done with him ?


Dolly .
Pack him off !
Pack him off at once !


[ Lucas cautiously looks in from upper conservatory door .


[ 109 ]


Lucas .
I say , how 's the old bird seem to take it ?


Dolly .
Old bird !


Lucas .
He is n't going to make a shindy over a trifle like this ?


Dolly .
Trifle !
He 's threatening to divorce her and expose you !


Lucas .
You do n't say so .
I 'm awfully sorry !


Dolly .
Sorry !


Lucas .
I am , indeed !
And any reparation I can make - -


Dolly .
Reparation ?!


Lucas .
Such as an apology - -


[ Dolly utters a contemptuous exclamation .


Matt .
Will you give me your word of honor never to see Mrs. Sturgess again ?


Lucas .
Yes .


Matt .
Or write to her ?


Lucas .
Yes .


Matt .
The word of honour of an English gentleman used to mean something , Lu .


Lucas .
It does now , Uncle Matt !


Matt .
[ Shakes hands with him heartily . ]
Then I 'll take it .
Now be off as quickly as you can and let us make the best of it for you and her .


Lucas .
Thanks .
Good-bye !


Matt .
Good-bye !


[ Lucas crosses to Dolly , offers his hand .


Dolly .
No , Lu .
If Renie gets out of this safely and if you behave yourself , I 'll shake hands with you when you come back from India .


Lucas .
You 're taking this too seriously - you 're taking it far too seriously !
[ Exit .


Matt .
We 're making a splendid start again for the New Year !


Dolly .
I hope this will be a lesson for Renie !


Matt .
I hope so .
How about yourself ?
[ 110 ]


Dolly .
What do you mean ?


Matt .
I put the sovereign in , but - you 've got a few more bills , eh ?


Dolly .
Just a few oddments .


Matt .
How much ?


Dolly .
I do n't know .
Dad - -


Matt .
Well ?


Dolly .
Now that South Africans have gone up at last , and you won that splendid coup on them last week - -


Matt .
Well ?


Dolly .
You could n't lend me - a few hundreds - till my allowance comes due ?
Just a few hundreds - -


Matt .
[ In a low reproachful tone , shaking his head . ]
What ?
What ?
What ?
Sad !
Sad !
Sad !!


Dolly .
[ Listens . ]
There 's Harry !
You will help me , Dad - you will ?


Matt .
I 'll see what I can do .


Harry enters cheerfully .
Harry .
That 's all right , Doll !
There 's the address .


[ Giving a slip of paper .


Dolly .
Thanks , dear .


Harry .
And now about these mere oddments ?


Dolly .
Not now , dear .


Harry .
Yes , dear , now .
[ Very sternly . ]
This instant !


Dolly .
Harry , you 're going to lose your temper - -


Harry .
No .
I 'm going to keep a firm guard on it , but [ very sternly ] let me see those bills .


Dolly .
[ Creeps frightened up to the desk . ]
I 'm sure you 're going to lose your temper .


[ Opens the desk .


Harry .
[ Firmly . ]
No .
I 'm quite calm .
Whose bill is that ?
[ She hands him one timorously . ]
Fulks and Garner !
Artist Furriers !
More artists !
[ looks at total ] [ 111 ] - one hundred and twenty-four pounds .
Well , I 'm - -


Dolly .
Ah , Jobling !


Harry .
I should think I am Jobling .
And you said you 'd never enter their shop again !


Dolly .
I never meant it , but this time it was absolutely necessary - -


Harry .
Necessary ?


Dolly .
Yes - you see the chief item - -


Harry .
[ Reads . ]
Chinchilla toque , coat , muff and boa - eighty guineas - eighty guineas - -


Dolly .
I got them as a surprise for you when we go South next week .


Harry .
Surprise !
Great heavens !
What in the name of all - -


Matt .
Shush , Harry !
Her motive was a good one .
She got it to please you !


Dolly .
You have n't seen it yet , it 's just outside - I 've a great mind to give you a great New Year 's treat and let you see it on !


Harry .
I 'm not going to be sweedled - -


Matt .
Hush !
Harry !
Let her put it on !
Let 's have a look at it , and see whether it 's worth the money .
Put it on , Doll .
[ Exit Dolly .


Harry .
[ Calls after her . ]
I tell you I 'm not going to be sweedled !
- -


Matt .
What is sweedled ?


Harry .
Sweedling is sweedling !
It 's part swindling and part wheedling !
It 's what every d - ee - d good-natured husband like me has to go through , when he 's fool enough to put up with it !


Matt .
Well , old boy , you 'll have to pay , you know  it will come to that in the end .


Harry .
I 'm not going to be sweedled - -


Matt .
And if Dolly has been a little extravagant , I must help her out with it to-morrow morning !
[ 112 ]


Harry .
No , we 'll go into it thoroughly to-night .


Matt .
No , Harry , we wo n't .
My room is just above here .
Besides , the cook is going to give us a special New Year dinner , and I want to enjoy it .
This New Year we 'll start with a comfortable evening , please !


Dolly enters at back in a very handsome Chinchilla coat .
Harry looks a little sulky .
She stands in the middle of the room and displays it .


Dolly .
Well ?
[ He looks at it rather sulkily , walks away  she follows him . ]
Well ?
[ Walking after him . ]
Well ?
Well ?


[ Displaying the furs . ]


[ He turns , looks at her , she stands and holds out her arms .


Harry .
Oh , hang it all !
[ Takes her in his arms and kisses her . ]
There !


Dolly .
[ Kissing him heartily . ]
And there !
[ Another kiss . ]
And there !
[ Another kiss . ]
And there !
[ Catches sight of the collecting box , goes to it , furiously sweeps it off its table on to the floor . ]
And there !


CURTAIN .
